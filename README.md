This bot scrapes twitter for popular trends and gets a tweet for each trend and then replies with a self generated reply. 
The bot also responds to user mentions provided that the mention has a parent tweet that does not contain any media.


## TODO

* Prevent bot from responding to itself and thus creating an infinite loop  
* Handle case where you exceed 50 of the trends and hit the twitter rate limit  
  * Increment the count parameter in _getPopularTweets by 1 and then get the next tweet  
* Update JSDocs
