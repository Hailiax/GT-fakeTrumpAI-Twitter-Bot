Ok. But you have to if you want to hit them hard you have to --
Bill, I agree. I'm probably going to have to say -- I have a way that would be very effective with respect to ISIS. But when I watch Obama get up and talk about in two weeks we're doing this, and in three weeks we're doing that --
Are you going to put American ground troops in to chase them around?
-- take back the oil. Once you go over and take back that oil they have nothing.
But how do you take it back?
You know right, you have to go in, you have to go in.
With ground troops?
Well you bomb the hell out of them and then you encircle it, and then you go in. And you let Mobil go in, and you let our great oil companies go in. Once you take that oil they have nothing left.
You're going to have unintended consequences. You're going to have Iraq not wanting you to do this. Syria not wanting you to do that.
There is no Iraq, there is no Iraq.
All right. So you don't respect them. You don't --
I don't have any respect for them, no.
All right, so they're out.
I don't respect --
All right. In order to defeat ISIS you're going to have to invade Syria. There's no way you can defeat them without invading. And I guess you're willing to do that.
I disagree. I say that you can defeat ISIS by taking their wealth.
All right.
Their wealth is the oil
Ok, the problem with the sanctions is that you're not going to get cooperation from Germany and these other countries.
Yes, you have to get them, that's what leadership is all about. You have to get them to work with us.
But they haven't worked with us.
You have Obama that wants to play golf instead of deal with people. You know part of being a leader is to get everybody in line and get them.
And you think you could convince?
Yes, I think I could. I really -- that's what I've done. I've made a fortune with foreign countries.
So you could make a deal with Putin to stop his expansion?
I would be willing to bet I would have a great relationship with Putin. It's about leadership.
Based on what? You're two macho guys? I mean, you know --
No, no, no I mean based on a feel. OK, you know deals are people.
You sound like George W. Bush. He looked into his soul and said he was a good guy. Come on.
Bush didn't have the IQ. Let me just tell you.
You know what I'm picking up from this. You'd buy Putin. You'd buy him almost.
I wouldn't buy him. I wouldn't buy him at all. I would be able to get along, in my opinion with Putin. Now it's possible not. I'm not saying 100 percent but I think I would have a very good relationship with Putin.
OK. I actually laughed when you said you're going to build this giant wall from San Diego to Brownsville and the Mexicans are going to pay for it. The Mexicans aren't going to pay for the wall.
Let me tell you. The Mexicans are the new China. What they are doing to this country --
They're not going to pay for the wall.
You have to let me handle that, ok.
Well tell me how you're going to make them pay for the wall.
Because they are ripping us so badly.
Ok, ok.
No, no I'll tell you how.
Tell me.
Because I'll cut off all -- I'll start charging for their product coming into this country. Mexico is living off the United States.
So you'd try to strangle them economically unless they paid for the wall?
They will pay for the wall. And the wall will go up and Mexico will start behaving. Mexico is not our friend.
Or you'll break them economically.
I will do something that they will not be thrilled.
Why give it back?
They've taken money. Do you know that right now we owe China $1.3 trillion?
Yes.
We're paying them interest.
What do you do to China? Their powerful.
What you do to China is you say if you don't behave we're going to have to start taxing your goods coming into this country.
All right. A tariff.
They charge us tariffs. We don't charge them because we're stupid. They charge us. And the largest bank in the world is right under this floor.
And you really think you're going to get it through?
Absolutely. I've been dealing with politicians all my life.
They're going to fold under you?
Not fold. They're going to make -- that's just what they do Bill.
So just like Putin you're going to make him your friend, you're going to be able to make Congress your friend, too you think?
I think so absolutely.
Right.
I think so.
But that's the federal government creation. You know you've got to get the private sector to do that.
No you can -- you can stimulate through incentives. You can do tax free zones. You can --
The culture is driving that.
It's a tough culture.
Hillary Clinton first woman President -- war on women. You going to -- you're going to walk right into that.
Well I laugh when I see it. I was watching her talking about income and equality. That can be beaten. That can be beaten. All you have to do is take a look at her donor list.
But if you attack her you're going to be anti-women.
It's all right. And you know what, and maybe I don't win for that reason. But maybe I do.
Final question. Your Republican rivals. They're going to come after you, you know that.
That's ok.
You don't really take criticism all that well. You lash back --
I can take it. Yes I lash back, why wouldn't I lash back, you know?
Well now the President is supposed to have some kind of elevation, you know, where you have to overlook some things. You're not real good at that.
Well, I get things done, better than anybody.
All right. Are you going to slash and burn through this Republican field?
Well I don't have a lot of respect for many of them. And I can tell you --
You've got to go through --
You're right and I've been going through them all my life.
All right, you're telling me you could do it.
I've been dealing with them all my life.
Ok.
I mean this building was not supposed to get built. This building was supposed to be 18 stories tall and it's 68 stories tall. I dealt with politicians.
All right. The first debate is Fox and in the top 10 on the polling average you're going to get in. So you may very well get into that debate.
All right. Fine.
All right, so you're going to be looking at the other nine. Are you going to slash them? Are you going to get up there and --
Honestly Bill -- I won't be the nicest. I'm just going to be honest. I'm not going to slash and burn. I'm going to be honest. They don't have it. They're never going to bring this country back --
So you're going to look Jeb Bush in the eye and you're going to go common cause of disaster, you're this, and you're that.
Well I'm not a big fan. Sure. I'm not a big fan of Jeb Bush. The last thing we need is another Bush -- ok. Believe me. The last thing we need is another Bush.
So you're going to slash and burn.
All of my life they're all talk, they're no action and they're totally controlled by their donors and by the lobbyists. This country if we have another politician, that includes Hillary, we have another politician this country's going down.
You say the Affordable Care Act is probably one of the worst things President Obama has ever done. You are robe not wrong but I just wanted to know you say you are going to find something better. I want to know what that is.
Better than what? Who?
The Affordable Care Act.
There are a lot of plans that are better and lots of plans that have to get through Congress.
Welcome to your first day in politics.
Good.
One of the things you learn in New Hampshire politics is you can't be squishy. It's a new word for you probably.
That's good.
And Detroit has lost half its population, and they're bulldozing neighborhoods.
Detroit is slowly dying. Detroit is dying.
You said Mexico's not our friend. You said you -- you would build a fence -- nobody could build a better fence than Donald Trump.
A wall.
A wall. And you said that, basically, we've become the dumping ground for the world, that they're sending people here that we don't want. Some people got critical of that. It's not about...
A little bit critical. I'm not knocking anybody. I'm saying this...
I've been down there 10 times.
Oh, it's brutal.
I've seen it up close and personal.
No, it makes sense. Mexico's not going to say you, Sean, and you -- you go over. They -- they don't want that. They want to keep their people. They -- look, what's happening to our country -- and you used the term -- I used the term -- we're becoming a dumping ground for the rest of the world, not just Mexico, for the rest of the world. It's got to stop.
Let me ask about the concept of being presidential, transitioning from somebody that, basically, you say jump, and anybody working for you will say, How high, and they will do it immediately and you're able to get things done. You know, the wheels of Washington grind so ever -- ever so slowly.
I know that very well. Correct.
That's scary, right?
... I know the Republicans. He's not talking to anybody. So then he'll write an executive order because he can't get people to do what he wants them to do, so he writes out an executive order. We really do have a broken system. I have worked in this system for many years, and I've been very successful at it.
All right, do you need to -- you're such a big, dynamic personality. I watch you walk through this building. There are crowds. I've been on the streets of New York with you -- Donald! Everybody's calling your name. You get into Twitter fights with Rosie O'Donnell. Does that -- would that change in this environment? In other words...
Oh, of course it would.
It could?
I mean, look, when I fight someone -- well, Rosie's a bully...
Yes.
... and she bullies people. But she didn't bully me.
OK.
In fact, she was -- I was very proud -- she said actually that...
That was more fun for you.
... that was a big mistake that she made when she took me on.
There are bad guys there, in fairness, too.
Hey, no, the bad guys...
They're all bad.
They were bad anyway.
Yes.
But ISIS took over the oil and so did -- by the way, so did Iran. I mean, Iran now is meeting with Iraq to merge.
Yes.
You see what's happening. We...
You're -- you're...
... I don't want to take it any more.
You're a Republican. Let's say you didn't win the nomination. You wouldn't go third party, you'd support the eventual nominee?
Well, so many people want me to go third party. No, my inclination would never be...
You want to be a Republican? You would support the Republican?
I would much rather be -- I'm a conservative Republican.
But you're in this to win.
I'm in this to win.
Is Donald Trump in any way going to be any different on a campaign trail, knowing -- look, you saw The New York Daily News" today. They want to take you down -- meaning there are people -- there are people...
Well, the good news about The New York -- it's a failing newspaper. You know, they're trying to sell it.
Oh, it's being sold. Right.
Nobody wants to buy it. It loses like, $25, million, $30 million a year. I love that stuff. I love seeing bad newspapers fail, and that's a bad newspaper. I like to see good -- look, New York Post was fantastic. Do you agree with that?
I agree. Agree, totally.
The Daily News, they want to sell -- so they do a caricature. But The Daily News" is such a failing enterprise. I love seeing it.
OK.
I love it!
All right, we've got to take a break. We'll get very specific.
Good.
We'll talk about ISIS.
Good.
Right.
They're tapping us along right now. Did you ever see a deal take so long?
Can I ask...
This deal has been going on forever.
It will be extended beyond June.
It's a very bad deal for our country.
Here's a question I want to ask you, though.
And we're not negotiating from strength.
But if they're on the verge, you would take it out. If they're on the verge...
Let me -- let me explain before you get there...
OK.
... because certainly, you wouldn't want to do that or unless it's absolutely necessary.
Right.
You cannot let them have a nuclear weapon. That I can...
They laugh at us. They laugh at us.
Obama makes a statement and they call him a liar. They say, That's not the deal. And it turns out that they're right. We have people that are rank amateurs. And Kerry, who's a nice guy, he's not a negotiator. And then he goes into a bicycle race at 72 or 73 years old, and he breaks his leg!
Let me -- let me -- let me -- let me talk about your foreign policy experience. You talked about -- you think you'd be able to get along with Vladimir Putin. Have you had any contact with him?
Yes.
Explain.
So I was there two years ago. We had a tremendous success with the Miss Universe contest in -- I own Miss Universe, Miss U.S.A., all of that, and it does great. It's on NBC, but that's OK. But it does fantastically well.
Yes.
And two years ago, we had it in Moscow, and it was a tremendous success. And I got to meet everybody. I got to meet all...
Did he tell you that?
I don't want to say. He hates Obama. And Obama hates him, in all fairness.
You -- you have...
You understand what I mean by that.
I understand what you're saying.
Why isn't Germany...
It's in their best interest.
Why isn't Germany saying to us, Come on, we have to do something. In fact...
And if you were president, you would pressure them to do it?
Well, let -- I wouldn't pressure Germany, frankly. They should be pressuring us.
Yes.
Germany and the European countries should be pressuring us to help.
Because this is their problem.
We're pressuring Germany. Why aren't you fight -- what are we doing?
And let me ask you...
Look, the truth is, we don't know what we're doing.
The biggest threat obviously right now is radical Islam. We saw what happened on 9/11 not far from this building of yours. You've talked about you have a strategy to deal with ISIS. You say you don't want to tell anybody.
I would rather not, but I'm going to.
Wouldn't it help -- wouldn't it help the country?
I would rather not, but I'm going to. And the reason is -- I say it -- look, when I watch Obama get up and say that in two weeks, we're going to attack here, in two weeks we're going to do that, we're going to have boots on the ground, we're not going to have boots on the ground -- he tells everything that...
I agreed with you at the time.
OK.
Yes.
Take the oil. We're going out of Iraq. Take the oil. Give the families of the veterans and the families of the soldiers that died there and the wounded warriors -- give them millions of dollars each. It's peanuts compared to what we're talking about. I said, Take the oil. Everybody said -- not everybody -- the stupid people said, Don't do that.
Let them pay for their -- this was about paying for their liberation that we gave -- that we gave them.
Look, Iraq doesn't even exist. Iraq is a mess. There's no Iraq. Nobody's proud of Iraq.
All right. So quickly...
By the way, it's not these soldiers are not brave.
Would you tell Obama what your ISIS strategy is, if he called?
I would. I wish they'd call. But they don't call because they're not smart people.
He said last week he still doesn't have a strategy. He said 10 months ago he doesn't have a strategy.
So I will tell you what they should do.
What?
ISIS is tremendously rich. They're rich. You know why? Because of the oil. They have the oil. That's why they're rich. They are building...
If you were president today, you'd take out those oil sites tomorrow:
I would knock out that oil. And...
... 93 million out of the labor force, 46 million on food stamps for 40 months or longer, 50 million Americans in poverty. You say you'd be the greatest jobs president. Let's get specific. How will you create those jobs?
And by the way, our Gross Domestic Product was just announced. We're less than zero. It's unheard of!
Negative growth.
Less than zero.
All right, if you become president, you'll inherit $20 trillion in debt, $100 trillion in unemployment liabilities...
Tremendous problems. Tremendous problems.
... all those unemployment poverty numbers I gave you. So would you balance a budget? You said you wouldn't cut entitlements. You said you wouldn't cut the military. You said you'd increase support for veterans.
I won't cut Social Security. It's unfair to people.
You wouldn't?
No. And here's a...
Would you be able to get a...
-- but we don't use them. We use politicians, we use diplomats that got their job because they gave campaign contributions...
Let me ask you, would you be able to get 50 million Americans out of poverty?
I would. I would -- I would create incentives for people to work. People don't have an incentive. They make more money by sitting there doing nothing than they make if they have a job.
You'd take the incentive away.
We have to create incentives that they actually do much better by working. Right now, they have a disincentive. They have an incentive not to work.
You would insist for food stamps, welfare, any assistance, that you have to work for it.
Well, you could -- you could start looking at things like that. And actually Bill Clinton wanted that, a lot of people wanted that over the years. You know, a lot of democrats frankly wanted that. A lot of liberals wanted that. The problem we have right now, we have a society that sits back and says we're not going to do anything. And eventually the 50 percent cannot carry, and it's unfair to them, but cannot carry the other 50 percent.
So you become President, you talked about new trade deals, you talk about the importance of balancing a budget, not cutting Social Security entitlements. How quickly can you get 46 million Americans off food stamps and 50 million Americans off poverty? Give me the four things that you would do immediately to jump start the economy.
Well, it's actually not four things.
Five things?
No, it's not a question of things. It's a question of incentives. We have to create incentives. We have to restructure our tax system so that people create incentives. You can do zones. You can do lots of different things to get people to work. We have to change -- I mean, we have a very massive change coming up because this country cannot sustain itself. It just can't. You know that. You've been preaching at us for business.
Welcome back to HANNITY. We continue for the hour with 2016 GOP Presidential Candidate, Donald Trump. All right, short segment, quick answers, let's go through some social issues. You are pro-life?
Yes.
Rape, incest, mother's life, exceptions.
Yes, exactly.
OK, gay marriage?
I am traditional. I am for traditional, and it's a changing, it's a changing format, but I am very much of a traditional man.
Colorado marijuana?
Well, I don't like what's coming out. I mean if you look -- I'm all for medical marijuana --
Sure.
-- and its help. But what's coming out is some really bad things are happening in Colorado with respect to people. So I would have to look at that very, very --
States' rights versus the Federal Government intrusion?
Well, I think so. But, by the way, I just want to go back to the marijuana. A lot of bad information is coming. You know, a lot of people were all in favor of it and now all of a sudden they're saying it's having tremendously damaging effects to the mind, to the brain, to everything. So it's a big problem.
What about the rights, New York City, almost impossible to get a concealed carry permit. I happen to have one.
And I have one too.
OK, it took a lot of death rows to get that pretty much.
Very hard. And yet there's a lot of people out there have them and they don't have permits, OK.
They don't obey the laws.
That's a problem. Should that mean -- well first of all I'm a huge Second Amendment person. Something's very interesting that happened Sean. The two prisoners that escaped --
Yes.
You have people with houses up there that were against guns --
And now they're for them.
And now they're so happy they have guns. They're sitting there, and one woman said I was totally against guns, my husband was for them. It was very funny. And I see her on television and she said now we have a gun on every table.
Yes.
So, you know, there's a good example.
Do you believe climate change is a science you can --
I'm not a believer in manmade -- look, this planet is so massive. And when I hear Obama saying that climate change is the number one problem it is just madness. And by the way it started this global cooling, I mean we went through global warming --
Ice age.
-- global cooling --
Now it's just climate change.
They don't even know. Now they just call it -- no, they call it extreme weather.
Yes.
You know, they've now reduced it to extreme weather so.
Let me ask you about your some of the top rated competitors in the Republican. First thought that comes to your mind, Rand Paul?
A really nice guy. I mean, I've gotten to know him. I do like him a lot. He called me, he wanted to meet. And I do like him. I disagree with some of his policies, but that's OK.
Sure.
And Bush by all accounts was his mentor. And I think he was extremely disloyal to Bush. And if you can I will ask you to ask me about Bush next, because I watched your show last night --
Yes.
And I thought it was horrible when he said "a dear friend," "a dear friend." You said Marco Rubio to Bush, and Bush said "a dear friend." That's politics. See, that's what I mean, they're all talk --
Well, what do you think of Jeb Bush putting aside the Marco issue?
I think he's probably a nice guy. I honestly don't -- he looks very unhappy to me. He doesn't look like a person that wants to be doing this.
OK, Scott Walker.
I know him very well. He came up to see me three, four weeks ago. He gave me a plaque -- he gave me a plaque. And I like him a lot. The problem is Wisconsin is having a lot of problems. I mean, they're doing not well. And there's a tremendous amount of debt being piled up, and they're having a lot of difficulties.
Carly Fiorina?
Again, I don't know her, I never met her. And she looks very nice, but she got fired viciously at Hewlett Packard. I don't mean like a little bit. You know business is my game --
Yes, sure.
And I watch it, I studied the stuff. She got fired viciously at Hewlett Packard. Then she ran for the Senate against Barbara Boxer and lost in a landslide.
Rick Perry?
And then you go out -- I think he's such a nice guy. I mean, he's actually somebody that when you're with him it's much different than his persona.
You're like that, do you know that?
Yes, but hopefully the opposite way.
A little bit right?
Actually I'm a nice person. A lot of people don't know that. You know I give a lot of money to charities good things.
All right.
But I will say this --
I want to ask you --
Rick Perry, nice guy, I don't think he has a chance.
Will Americans elect somebody with that -- with that lack of trust and honesty?
Yeah, you know, when I see it, it's going to be -- it's going to be a competitive race. I can say that. It's, in a way, a lot of -- it's amazing. I think many of these Republican candidates, and I won't mention which one, I don't think they have a chance.
You know, this is the interesting -- she had a subpoena. She deleted 30,000, then wipes her server clean. Then we're finding emails that Sidney Blumenthal are handing in that she was supposed to have handed over back in 2012.
And this is what bothers me about the Republican politicians.
Wow.
It's dead. It's a dead issue. They don't even bring it up anymore. Explain to me, why don't they bring it up anymore? It's like a dead issue. You don't even hear about the emails.
Can you name one thing -- one specific thing that she's accomplished all these years she's been in the public eye that have made people's lives better?
People -- I hear the question all the time, and I see other people trying to answer it, and you can't answer it.
I'm having a lot of fun with it because I would play the "Jeopardy!" theme behind people. I said, all right, name one specific accomplishment of Hillary and, "Uh, she's a champion of -- "
Her biggest fans. And I've watched on different shows. Her biggest fans are asked that question. They can't answer it. They're sitting there like, uh, well, uh, uh.
That's hilarious.
One person said she's a woman. That was the best answer.
What do you think of her taking money from all these countries for the Foundation? And they have atrocious human rights records for women, gays and lesbians, and she wants to be their champion?
Well, it's a total conflict of interest. And it could be illegal. It's -- at a minimum, it's a conflict of interest.
Well, they'd taken $26 million from Sweden, she's Secretary of State, for the Foundation, and they want an exemption so they can continue to do business with Iran and not be part of the sanctions, and she grants it.
If that's a conservative Republican doing it, they're gone.
Jail. Jail.
It's jail.
How would you deal, if you're candidate, with Republicans are sexist, Republicans hate people, Republicans want to throw granny over the cliff, they're racist.
You've just got to -- I'll tell you what. I happen to think that this is going to be an election based on competence, not personality. Somebody said to me, do you think you have a good personality? I go, I don't know. People like me. You like me. I mean, people that know me like me. But I said, I'm not sure it's important this time. I think it's going to be based on competence. One thing I do is create a great society, create jobs.
All right, one --
And I think that wins the election.
He doesn't talk to his own party.
We -- you can work with politicians, including politicians on the other side.
All right, one last question about presidential -- the new environment that you've entered. It's unlike any deal you've ever done before. You will have access to nuclear weapons. You'll have your finger on the button. Are you ready for the onslaught, the avalanche, if you will, of criticisms that will come your way?
You know I've been a very public person all my life, for whatever reason, while I've been in business. They say I'm the best known businessman. I wrote "The Art of the Deal," which is the number one selling business book of all time, with The Apprentice, which became number one and has continued to be a tremendous success. So I've been in the public eye. And, you know, when you talk about the nuclear button, the ones I'm worried about are the other people on the other side that have the nuclear. But don't worry about me. Worry about these maniacs that are trying to get nuclear weapons.
Some that have them.
We have to keep them -- and some that have them -- we have to keep that away from these people. That's really going to be, and that would be actually the better question.
For every candidate, we've given them a last minute to make your pitch why you want to be president and what you'll do as president. It's all yours.
Well, the reason that I want to be president is I want to make America great again. It's very simple. That's my whole thing. That's my whole concept. We have tremendous potential. The world is ripping us off. China is taking advantage. They're taking our jobs, they're taking our money, they're taking our manufacturing. They're then loaning the money back to us and we pay them interest. That wouldn't happen with me. Mexico is a disaster at the border, people flowing through, and they're taking us economically. Japan, everybody, we're a laughingstock. That wouldn't happen under President Trump.
And you want to get Americans back to work?
We're going to make America great again.
Do you agree with the point that -- the position he's taking, which is that the earth is getting warmer? Do you agree with that?
Well, I'm not a big believer in the whole global warming phenomena, OK? I'm not a person that, as you probably -- you know very well, my attitude is that, and I feel very strongly about this, clean air is so important.
There's an important Republican interest group that you, I know, are familiar with, the Club for Growth.
Yes.
This morning they issued a statement saying that you should not be taken seriously as a presidential candidate. They cited a number of things that they have problems with. I'm going to ask you about two of them.
Sure.
Are you insecure?
Everyone is insecure.
What are you insecure about? Your looks? Your personality? Whether people like you?
I don't know. I mean, I don't think of myself as insecure, probably we're all insecure. You know, maybe insecurity is what makes you successful.
But be introspective, what are you insecure about?
Well, it is my hair.
Yes, we love your hair.
Like it or not, that's OK.
So what are you insecure...
Better than most.
You said, you don't see it. Will you run negative television ads against other Republicans?
I might.
You might.
I might. I don't know that I will. But I might.
And if you did, what would be off-limits, what wouldn't be off-limits? Would you just run them on policy?
Well...
Or might you run them on their...
No, I...
... finances or their personal stuff?
I wouldn't do personal. No, I wouldn't do personal. I would probably do policy. I would probably do maybe the past. You know, I've had a very good past. I've had great success.
You have been critical, for instance, of Jeb Bush on Common Core and immigration.
I am very critical.
Than they thought.
Yes.
Mitt Romney. Will you spend -- if it's going well...
Oh, I'm going to spend millions. Oh, I'm going to spend many millions.
When you came out we thought that you were in favor of legalizing drugs.
Well, I mean...
You have suggested that Governor Bush, Senator Rubio, Senator Santorum, Carly Fiorina, are all losers, people who shouldn't win and can't win.
Well, I don't think I used that name.
You did about some of them.
I did?
What problems are you talking about?
The debt and the difficult problems that they have going on in Wisconsin that a lot of people don't understand and know about. Tremendous borrowings. And they have difficulties.
So is there anybody in the field you look at and say, boy, that person has got a great record, they are really formidable?
Well, you mentioned four. I mean, Carly Fiorina, who I don't know, I don't think I've ever met her, she was viciously fired, viciously. This wasn't like a normal fire. The reason I know about it, because, you know, it's not my world, but she was viciously fired...
Santorum.
And he is really a nice guy, Rick Santorum. But I tell him, I say, look, you were a sitting senator in Pennsylvania. You lost by 19 points, which is like a record. And now you say, OK, I lost by the -- in the history of the Senate, I think, they said for, you know, a sitting senator, lost by a record, 19 points. Now you say, OK, now I'm going to run for president.
We were sitting there yesterday as you came in, made your entrance, came down the escalators there. I was enjoying listening to Neil Young, love that song, love that performer, but I did think to myself, you know, I wonder what Neil Young is going to think, he's pretty liberal, I'm not sure he's...
He is.
I'm not sure he's going to love this...
Do you know he is a friend of mine?
So you are saying Neil Young calls you as a friend, but then when you used the song...
Well, he really did.
But then when you used the song he came out and said, Donald, don't use that song.
I went to see Neil Young last year, I think it was like Carnegie Hall.
Carnegie Hall, I was there.
And it was great.
He is endorsing Bernie Sanders, which is not like a...
That's true.
Not really your politics.
Who, by the way, is doing very well. Bernie Sanders is doing very well.
Last question, keying off your Atlantic City roots.
Right.
What are the odds that Donald Trump will be the next president of the United States?
I asked that question to a lot people. What do you think? What do you think? A lot of people are saying, we're going to get -- look...
Give me some odds.
We're doing -- well, I'm running against political people that do it all their lives. I've never done this before. I don't do this.
Fifty to one?
I would say anywhere from 10 to 20 percent.
Ten to 20 percent.
I mean, I think. I think from 10 to 20 percent.
But you are telling me if I can get 10-to-one odds, because you're saying five-to-one is like the worst...
Yes.
Explain.
Probably we have 20 percent unemployment, not 5.6 percent. So I just think the country is doing terribly. We're ripped off by everybody, every country, including China, big league. Including Mexico.
And we've always heard --
You know who gets hurt? The people that saved their money, Joe. They saved their money. They did it the way you're supposed to. For 30 years, they saved their money. Always -- now they go to the bank, they're getting a getting a quarter of 1 percent on their savings. Those are the people, the middle class -- the middle in this country has been wiped out.
That's what I want to ask you. So what policies would you put in place? What changes would you make to try to lift up the middle class in ways that has not been accomplished before? Specifically.
The biggest thing we have to do is new trade agreements. China is killing us, Mexico is killing us, Japan is killing us. Everybody is beating us. We have incompetent people negotiating trade. We are losing money at every single step. We don't make good deals anymore.
Give us an example.
And that's why, Joe, I go out to speak, and I think Mark will tell you, although he's only about 70 percent there. But I think he will say I get the biggest crowds, I get the biggest ovations. I'm getting very good poll numbers and nobody until yesterday thought I was running. I mean, we're doing -- it's funny. It's funny.
Well, actually, that's what we said yesterday. But give us an example of how, because a lot of people believe that, right now, especially while we're negotiating the latest trade deal, that the United States is always out-negotiated on trade deals. Give me a good specific example of that.
Well, because China and all of these people, Mexico is the new China, by the way, Mexico is unbelievable, what they're doing with cars and with industry. They are taking our business like we're a bunch of babies. We don't have our best and our brightest negotiating for us. We have a bunch of losers, we have a bunch of political hacks. We have diplomats. And China puts the people -- hey, look. I know the smartest guys on Wall Street. I know our best negotiators. I know the overrated guys, the underrated guys, the guys that nobody ever heard of that are killers, that are great. We gotta use those people. We're using people --
So who would be a guy?
I'll give you an example.
Who's your Secretary of Treasury?
Joe, let me give you an example. Caroline Kennedy, I have seen "60 Minutes". She goes in, she says to the White House, oh, I would love a job. Would you like to be? Ambassador to Japan. Really, wow. She's like a negotiator for us in Japan. It's ridiculous. Japan is doing a number on us with the yen. You know, they just devalued the yen yet again.
Right.
We don't have people that know what's going on.
So, again, specifically, who -- give us a name on Wall Street that you might consider as a Secretary of Treasury, that'll be a tough negotiator.
I'll tell you what, I'd like guys like Jack Welch. I like guys like Henry Kravis. I'd love to bring my friend Carl Icahn. I mean, we have people that are great. We have people that are better than any of their negotiators.
That are tough.
We don't use them, Joe. We use people that are soft and weak and frankly stupid and incompetent.
But people can't live on what they're being paid.
Mika, the problem is we have to get jobs in the country. The jobs are being taken by Mexico and by China. The jobs are being taken by India. You call up American Express and you talk to somebody on the phone, they have an accent. You say where are you from? We're talking to them in India. And I say, we can't do that ourselves? We have to bring back jobs.
But don't you think wages are a part of that issue? And OK, obviously, you don't agree with raising the minimum wage, but do you agree that stagnating wages are a huge part of the jobs crisis in this country? And if so, what would you do to fix that?
Gross domestic product for the first quarter went below zero. That's unheard of. It's unheard of. I mean, where do you see it going below zero? In China, it goes up 8 percent, 9 percent. India, you look at these countries. Look at what's happening in Japan now. By the way, Japan is back, big league. They just devalued the yen. People are buying Komatsu tractors instead of Caterpillar tractors. I'm telling you, we're in trouble. We have a president who is incompetent, doesn't know what he's doing. And this country is going to go down. We have got a lot of problems in this country.
Two things, Donald. One, you're smart enough to know that words are --
What do you mean, smart enough? What does that mean?
He went to Wharton.
Well, I went to the Wharton school of Finance. I have to sort of say that. Because you know, like somebody says, "You're smart enough." But go ahead.
Words are weapons. So you have to have some form of collegiality if you're President of the United States.
I get along with everybody.
We've had four presidents since President Reagan. Which one was the best and why?
Well, you know, if you're asking me about the different presidents -- I, first of all, I'm a Reagan fan. You know, I was a very good friend of Reagan. I was a young guy, he was a much older guy, but I was a very good friend.
But I'm talking about the four presidents after.
I know. I've had relationships with -- I can tell you who is our worst president.
Well, I know what you're going to say for that, but of the four, who is the best?
Who am I going to say?
I'm going to guess you would say Bush. People would think you'd say Obama, but I'm going to guess you'd say Bush 43.
I'm not a fan of Bush, OK, and a lot of people are surprised. But he got us into Iraq. And if you look, Mark, in Reuters in '04, that's 11 years ago, Reuters, I said don't go into Iraq. You're going to destabilize the Middle East and the worst elements are going to take over the oil. And that's what happened.
ALL right, so of the four, who is the best?
Well --
Bush 41, Clinton, Bush 43, or Obama, and why?
I would really say Clinton, probably. I would have to say Clinton.
Before you get to Hillary, you got to go through the Republican field. Is Jeb Bush conservative enough to be president?
I hear you talking about Jeb Bush, and except I know you're a very honest guy, I would have said you're on his pay roll. I say what the hell is he talking about? He couldn't answer a simple question on Iraq? Is Iraq good or bad, the war?
What about Marco Rubio?
I think he's highly overrated.
You have better hair than Rubio.
And you know it's my hair.
Well, I do because I tugged on it once. He let me.
She tugged on it crazy.
Is there -- oh. Right there.
Hairspray, but it is mine.
Yesterday was a pretty big -- your announcement day was a pretty big day. What was it like for you and your family to be declared a candidate? You spent a lot of time with them.
Well, it was exciting. And I've gotten tremendous reviews on the speech for the most part. I've had a couple of people -- I'm not a fan of Krauthammer. I'm not a fan of George Will. I think he's a total dope, frankly. I know him. I think he's a total dope. You know, he's still angry. He made a speech at Mar-a-Lago, and at the time, I wasn't interested. It was a terrible speech, George Will, and I didn't show up. I didn't want to go. I'm the one who got him there; I didn't want to go. Because I found him to be a boring person. And that was like 12 years ago and I probably should have gone, because he interviews -- but he's, you know, he's a zippos. I'm not a fan of those guys. Generally speaking, I've gotten fantastic reviews.
Nobody cried.
Nobody cried.
Was there hugging?
My wife was happy. There was hugging, there almost kissing.
Almost.
Let me tell you, that's not what people -- like somebody said, Donald, you do really well on this stuff. You do -- you know, I'm doing, and I think you will say, considering nobody, like nobody, thought I was running, I think I'm doing quite well. Right? They're all saying, oh, gee, he's taking the place of some senator who's a stiff. You know, all the people, right? I built $9 billion worth of net worth. I own some of the greatest properties in the entire world, mortgage free for the most part, very low debt. I do a show on NBC, The Apprentice  was one of their biggest shows ever. It's a huge show and it's still a big show. And they renewed it. And I can't do it because I'm doing this.
That's what I wanted to --
I do a book, I do a book called "The Art Of The Deal." It's probably the No. 1 best selling business book of all sometime. I go to the Wharton School of Finance, I was a good student at the hardest school there is to get into; even though it was a long time ago it was still the hardest school. And then they say, oh, he's not qualified to -- and they take some dope who becomes a senator, who doesn't have -- who's nothing. And he's qualified to be on the stage, but Trump isn't qualified. Give me a break.
What's behind it?
Well, I don't want to say it because that would sound conceited. But there are --
Please, go ahead.
No, no, I don't want to do it. Why would I do that?
Not by a factor or three of four.
Well, come on.
There weren't.
Was anybody -- OK.
There were as many cameras at the Bush announcement on Monday. There were.
We had many more.
No. You didn't have many more.
No, I'll tell you --
All right, so Mark, you tried to humanize him. Now I'm going to try.
He tried.
No, no --
Joe, and many people who do.
But let me finish. It's building up to something here.
It sounds good.
All right, so anyway. Back to your point.
But the point is, I just think -- first of all, you know, you're born smart, you're born not smart, whether we like it or not.
Every time you get all about, every time say something good about your kids, you knock on wood. And then I cross myself even though I'm a Baptist.
That's right, because you don't know. Then you get a phone call, and you say oops.
Could you do The Apprentice  as president?
Well, you can't. You see, the problem is --
You can't as a candidate, but --
You're not allowed to do it because of the equal time rule.
All right, Donald Trump, it's good to have you in.
Good to have you. Thank you.
Donald, big discussion, big picture in the news today and over past few days has been race relations in this country. The president used the "N" word today, which is striking a controversy in some circles. Secretary Hillary Clinton used the term "white privilege" over the weekend. Tell me, are all these discussions, I mean, tell me how are race relations in this country in your mind and what would you do as president?
Well, it's always going to be a big topic. There is no question about it. You would have thought, with an African-American president, at a minimum, you would have thought he would have been a cheerleader for the country. And frankly, it would have been a lot better but it hasn't worked out very well. It's probably as bad as it has ever been. It's a big problem. One of the things that you have got to do is get the country working again. Get jobs, create jobs. Take jobs away from China. Take jobs away from Mexico and all the other places that are taking our jobs. People have no place to work. You know, the real unemployment number, Greta, is probably close to 20 percent. Might even be higher than that, according to many. We have to create places and jobs. If we don't do that, it's going to be a very, very long couple of years, I can tell you, and beyond.
So you think that the deep wounds have historically been in this country are healed with more jobs?
Well, it's going to help. I mean, you need lots of things. You need family. You need jobs. You need education. But jobs is something we can really do something about quickly. We have to take the jobs away from other countries that are making our products. They are taking our money. And they are, in fact, taking our jobs. Whether we like it or not, whether people want to talk about it or not, you look at what's going on in Japan and China and some other places, you look at the manufacturing that's going on, we are not doing it they are doing it.
It's official. You are in, 100 percent?
Which would be very disappointing to a lot of people that are all talk and no action, the politicians. You know, there is a whole big thing out there. These people will never bring us back to the promise land. They will never do it. A lot of politicians and a lot of pundits are very disappointed and they said, oh, he will never file. Well, I filed. As of today, I'm filed.
I am joined now by Donald Trump, candidate for the presidency of the United States. Donald Trump, welcome back to the Hugh Hewitt Show.
Well, thank you, Hugh, it's great to be with you, really great.
Now I've got, I would be remiss. I've got the greatest marketing and promotion genius in the last many years on the phone talking to me, and I've got this new book, The Queen: The Epic Ambition of Hillary and the Coming of the Second Clinton Era. What's your advice on how to sell books like this, Donald Trump, in this era?
Well, I think selling book just generally is, you know, it is a lot different than it used to be. I did The Art of the Deal, Hugh, as you know, and it was the number one selling business book, or at least so they say, of all time. And you know, it was a different world. I've never seen an industry change like the book selling business, because today, they pick up their computer, they pick up their iPhone, and they see everything that they want to see. So it's a little bit different. But I think if a message is good, if you can just get the message out, but today, you really need the right message to sell a book. There's no question about that.
Can I get Donald Trump to say "The Queen -- Buy it, get it?"
You said "The Queen?"
Yes.
"The Queen."
Yeah.
OK, and that, Hugh, let, me ask you something. Is that your book?
Oh, it's my book. I just wrote it about Hillary.
Oh, all right, good. Good. The Queen -- Buy it, get it. It's got to be good."
So Donald Trump, first of all, she attacked you personally, didn't name you. What do you think about that?
Well number one, I'm honored. And number two, as far as Mexico is concerned, I believe strongly in a very, very strong border. We have no border right now. It's like a sieve. It's like water pouring through. It's ridiculous. And I have a great relationship with Mexico. I have a great relationship with Mexican people. And frankly, you know, I just feel strongly that you have to have a border, and it has to be strong. I often say that nobody can build a wall like I can build a wall. I build great buildings all over, all over the world, and frankly, nobody can build like I can build, and nobody can build a wall like I can. And people, some people thought that was a racist statement. It's not. And I'm not talking about keeping Mexicans out. I'm talking about keeping the world out. You know, we're like a dumping ground for the rest of the world, Hugh. I mean, they just send, and we're not getting the finest people. We're getting people that many other countries, including Mexico, don't want. They're sending them over to us, because our government is so stupid and so foolishly run that we accept everybody with open arms. It's not like the old days. So we're getting a lot of bad people coming in, and I'm not talking about Mexicans. I'm talking about a lot of bad people period.
So she has falsely accused you, Donald?
And they're coming through, and they're pouring through our border, and we don't know what to do with them. So we just, and we literally fly them to all parts of the country. We take them to all parts of the country. So I feel we need a strong border. I don't feel, I know. If we're going to run, if we're going to have a country, we need a border. And we have to have a strong border so illegals aren't coming in, and that's illegals from all over the world.
But Hillary was saying that you were using incendiary speech. Did she falsely accuse you?
Well, I would say yes, because I don't. I mean, all I do is I want to have borders. Now if that is incendiary, if that's, you know, being tough or being unfair, you let me know. But I think having borders, and having strong borders, and I mean strong borders, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. And frankly, this country had better get smarter, or we're not going to have a country. We're, as I said, we're a dumping ground for the rest of the world, and we have got to create a border. You don't have a country without a border. You know, what's a country? How do you define a country if you don't have borders? So many people have given me praise for saying it. A lot of the people running, they don't want to say it, because you know, you take some heat when you say it. And this has nothing to do with the Mexicans coming in. This has to do with the world coming in. The world is coming in. You're going to have the Middle East coming in, you're going to have everybody coming in, because it's literally a sieve.
Now Donald Trump, let's turn to the second part of what the former Secretary of State said. Let's talk about guns.
Right.
What would you do, Donald Trump, to end gun violence in the United States?
Well, first of all, I'm a huge 2nd Amendment person. I believe in it. And I told the story, actually, it was very interesting, because when I announced last Tuesday, which was quite an announcement. We've gotten wonderful feedback on that. And when I announced, I told the story about a woman and a man living together, husband and wife, and they're up in upstate New York. You had these two killers amazingly get out of a maximum security prison, which was fascinating in itself. And they get out, and they're vicious guys. And the woman was always against guns, I mean, strongly against guns. And the man was in favor. And all of a sudden, she said you know what? You're right. Now they've said they have a gun on every table, because they don't know who's going to pop into their house. And it's very interesting, but no, I've always been a very strong 2nd Amendment person. Interestingly, if you look at Chicago, they have about the strongest gun control laws in the nation. And they are riddled with problems, riddled with problems. And you look at New York tremendous gun control laws, very, very hard to get a gun, almost without exception, it's rampant. So you know, it's like, you can't legislate against this. I'm a 2nd Amendment, I believe in it. You have to have the right to protect yourself. One thing you know for sure, Hugh, is that the people, the bad ones, are not giving up their guns, OK? And you know, you have some people, they want to give up the guns, they want to change the size of the magazines where you can have seven bullets, not ten. Can you imagine a bad guy loading up a magazine, and he says you know, I think I'll abide by the law. I'll only put in seven bullets. You have a magazine that holds ten and more bullets, and they say oh, good, we'll only put in seven, because we want to abide by the law. So the bad people, the bad folks that have these guns are not giving them up. And the good ones will give them up if legislated, and you can't allow that to happen.
So Donald Trump, we have six incidents, and let me list them for the audience. We have the massacre in Charleston last Wednesday night. We've got Michael Brown in Ferguson, we have Freddie Gray in Baltimore, we have Eric Garner in New York City, Tamir Rice in Cleveland, and of course, Trayvon Martin. Are they connected in some way, because of the media coverage...
I was just going to say, you're reading them off, they're all so different when you think of it. I mean, they're all so different. And each one of those is quite a bit different from the other, and all very sad and horrible. But they're all, I mean, they're really, I think they're very, very different incidents.
And so what, what should the conversation be about? As I said on Face the Nation yesterday, after the people are buried and grieved in Charleston is when people ought to talk about the Confederate flag. But generally speaking, there is this series of incidents involving race. Is there a lesson that Donald Trump draws from them?
Well, one of the things that I watched in Charleston, and I'm there a lot, and we have a lot of relationships over there, and one, I thought it first of all was horrible, and this guy is a sick cookie and lots of problems and everything else. But I thought it was amazing the way the people came together. It was like beautiful. There some something beautiful, even right after this horrible tragedy took place, the way they held hands and prayed, I saw them drop to their knees and start to pray. There was something really dignified, and as horrible as the tragedy was, there was something beautiful the way the people came together, and still are coming together. So I thought it was, maybe it was a lesson, almost, because you see so many problems in so many different locations, Hugh, and all of a sudden, you see this beautiful, this beautiful aftermath to a horrible tragedy. And I watched it, and I thought it was really incredible, actually.
But are race relations cratering That is true. That is very inspiring, and a lot of pulpits heard a lot of sermons yesterday about forgiveness such as the families practiced. But are race relations generally in America cratering right now?
Well, we have an African-American president, and you know, the biggest thing that I thought, I was never a fan, but I always thought that when he got elected, when Obama got elected, he'd be a cheerleader for the country. And certainly, you would have thought he would have been much better for African-Americans who are really suffering, more than anybody else right now in terms of jobs and everything else. So you have an African-American president, and African-American youth is doing worse than virtually it's ever done. I mean, we've had some pretty bad times in this country, but virtually, it's ever done, and you would think that that couldn't have happened with Obama as president. So look, I am a big believer in jobs. We're losing our jobs to China. We're losing our jobs to Mexico and so many other places. And I'm just a big believer we have to bring our jobs back. We have to have plants being built in this country, not in other countries. I'm a free trader, but the problem with free trade is we need smart leaders, and we don't have smart leaders. I love free trade. I love the concept. But we don't have free trade with China, because if you want to sell something in China, if you're a manufacturer, Hugh, and you want to go to China and sell your product, it's going to be almost impossible for you to do so. And yet they come in here and they openly sell it, no tax, no nothing. So I believe in free trade totally, but you need smart leaders. And you need rules.
But Donald Trump, when you get on a microphone, the whole country watches you. And I call you just an American P.T. Barnum combined with Howard Dean combined, you're just legendary at getting people to focus on you. Yesterday, Michael Gerson said one of the Republicans has to step up and talk about ending or diminishing violence in the United States, and I agree with that. How could Donald Trump help in that? I mean, how do you help stop the slaughter in Chicago, not just the slaughter in Charleston, but generally, what can candidates do to bring down the volume and to increase the peace?
It is a huge problem. It's a problem that's very rarely discussed. It's being discussed by you a little bit, and a few other people. But even you don't want to hit it the way you've really liked to hit it. If you hit it hard and you start talking about, and if you start talking about and going into great details, you get called racist. You get called everything. It's a huge problem in this country. People need to be enthusiastic. They need to love our country. And they need to have hope. They have no hope. They absolutely have no hope. And they have no jobs. They need jobs. They need hope. They need cheerleading. They have nothing going right now. The gang violence, which is a part of this, is unbelievable. So it's a big problem. But one of the ways you have to start, and if you look at what's going on in Chicago, it's like a bloodbath, and it's only in certain areas of Chicago, and nobody talks about it. They don't say that. They just talk about Chicago. I mean, it's only in certain areas of Chicago. It's in certain areas of New York and lots of other places. They need hope, and they need jobs. You've got to, you've got to create incentives for people to go out. And you have to be able to have the jobs. I know people that have, you know, they go to college, kids go to college, they spend money, they borrow it to the hilt, they owe tremendous student loan debt, they have debt all over the place, and they get out, and they do well. They get good marks, and they're really good students, and they can't get a job. They don't have jobs.
Last question, because I think you're onto something here, and I know we've got a hard break at:15. They need cheerleading. You just said that. Ronald Reagan was a big cheerleader. I worked for Ronald Reagan.
Absolutely. He was a huge cheerleader.
So he was a great cheerleader.
Yeah, Ronald Reagan was a great cheerleader.
Explain to people what you mean by cheerleading.
Creating a spirit for the country. We don't have that spirit anymore. You know, it's very interesting, my daughter, Ivanka, told me a story that she would go when she was a very young girl to a communist country, Czechoslovakia, and they were so proud of the American dollar, they used to, I never heard this before. They used to take the American dollar and scotch tape it onto their windshield of their car, even if it was a dollar bill, because they were so proud of having anything American. They were proud of even just a small one dollar association with the United States. And they'd post it, and she said today, it's a whole different thing. Today, they laugh at us and they scoff at us. But you know, she told me that story, and I think I'm going to use that a little bit. I haven't used it except for you right now, but I heard it two days ago. And she said you know, dad, when I used to go to Czechoslovakia, because he in-laws were there, she'd go there for a week. And the people were so proud of that dollar being posted on the windshield of their car. We don't have anything like that today. Today, they're not proud.
Donald Trump, I am glad to have you use my prompt, and I will use your prompt to promote the Queen. Thanks for coming, come back early and often through 2015.
Fantastic. Thank you very much, Hugh.
Mr. Trump, thank you for being here tonight. Your reaction now to the fact that this -- the president of programming and content at Univision sent out a picture on his Instagram account comparing you to a mass murder.
Well, I think it's disgraceful. I think he should be ashamed of himself. He immediately deleted it and the lawyers are going to have a field day. And as you know, they broke a contract. We have a binding five-year contract where they pay a lot of money. And they broke it and they're not allowed to do that. They have no right to break it. And frankly Mexico though, there are people, there are leaders that are much smarter than our leaders. They're taking advantage of the United States both at the border and on trade. And the reason that Univision in my opinion broke the contract, because a tremendous amount of pressure was put on frankly by Mexico and by the leaders of Mexico put on Univision because they didn't like what I was saying about trade.
They say, they went on the record and actually said specifically that it was the comments you made based on your recent quote, this is a quote, "insulting remarks about Mexican immigrants." That's why they said they canceled the Miss Universe contract.
Frankly tremendously bad people are coming in. All you have to do is speak to the border patrol. They'll tell you. We have horrible -- -- we have some terrible people coming in not only from Mexico. They're flowing through Mexico through the border but they're coming from all over. And they are killers and they are people that we don't want in this country in many cases. So, I speak my mind. I make speeches about it. I get the biggest crowds. I get the biggest standing ovations. Everybody knows what I'm saying is true. And by the way, the Mexican government knows obviously they're going to try and send lots of bad ones. Certainly some wonderful people come through. They should do it in a legal fashion. But some wonderful people come through.
Let me ask you about Univision specifically. Because I understand you're depending your remarks. But what do you make of this television company. Now its president of content suggesting you're just like a mass murder, then their lead news anchor, news anchor, Jorge Ramos sent out the New York Daily news cover that puts you in a clown face with favor. So he favors this. This is their news anchor, this is likely to be the person who will participate in the hosting of this presidential forum. My question to you is, will you attend if they in fact are allowed to host this?
Well, I don't think they should be allowed. It's a total conflict. And by the way, they're also big supporters of Hillary Clinton. If you look at the people from Univision they're big supporters of Hillary Clinton. You know that.
Would you go? Would you sit there at Univision for a forum after this?
Well, based on the polls I easily qualify, that I can tell you. And I guess I would probably go because I would just have to go and defend myself. They may be much tougher on me than anybody else because certainly the people that I am running against are not -- Jeb Bush does not speak this way, that I can tell you. If Jeb Bush was in my position, he would have folded. He wouldn't have done -- which I could have done very easily. All I have to do is be silent and Mexico would continue to rip us off for many years to come. But that's not what our country needs to be great again.
Donald Trump. Always great to hear from you. Thank you for being here.
Thank you very much.
Outfront now, the Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, thanks so much for being with me. When you break that poll down, you are polling No. 2 among Republicans in New Hampshire. Does that surprise you?
Well, people like my message. They want to see the United States do well again. We are being ripped off by every country -- I mean, we are just being ripped off by every country you do business with, and Erin, it's very sad to see what's happening.
On the economy and on trade in that poll, you do come out on top, by far, easily, you come out on top, Donald, but only 8 percent of voters say you have the personal characteristics and qualities a president should have, and 7 percent say you have the best chance versus the Democratic nominee. Those numbers are pretty grim.
I think really a lot of people haven't heard the message. They haven't seen me. The fact is, I do get along very well with people. I've built things and done things all over the world. I've made tremendous amounts of money. You know, I've had an interesting life, but -- and I wouldn't mind keeping it going the way it's going. But I'm looking at what's going on, whether it's our southern border that's being -- just horribly violated or whether it's our trade deals with other countries. It's very sad what's going on.
I don't know if you've seen that last little clip from Jeb Bush, but it's a dismissive look on his face. Frankly, he's pretty dismissive of you, Donald.
I don't think he's dismissive at all. I think he's doing a good act, and frankly, he's weak on immigration, which is a terrible thing. You remember his statement, they come to the country for love, and that was derided by everybody. He's very weak on immigration. And you have to be strong or we're not going to have a country left. You have to be very strong at the border. And he's also in favor of common core, which is education through Washington, D.C. In other words, let the bureaucrats educate your children. And I don't think he's dismissive at all. I think he wants to put on the act like he's dismissive. But if you look at the poll numbers, he better be careful.
So you absolutely wouldn't change it, and specifically when you said they are rapists and some, I assume, are good people. But you don't have any regret about that.
Well, some are. Some are good, some are rapists, and some are killers. And we don't even know what we're getting. And they aren't just coming from Mexico. They are coming from all over. So certainly you know that's true. And from a common sense standpoint, you know that's true.
So the length of the border is just about 2,000 miles, right, 1,954. The General Accounting Office did an analysis about five years ago, and they said their estimate of what a fence would cost is $3.9 million a mile. You know math, Donald, as well as anyone, that's $7.6 billion. You have said Mexico would pay for that. Are you going to get them to pay $7.6 billion?
The answer is yes, I would get Mexico to pay, because frankly, they are taking so much money out of the United States hide. They are taking so much money from us. That's peanuts compared to the kind of money that you're talking about. Plus, you don't need a wall for the entire piece, because we have wonderful people, border patrol people, that can do the job. But you do need walls in certain sections, without question.
Donald, I want to get to the issue of your wealth. You said that you're going to fund this campaign yourself. Forbes estimates your wealth at $4.1 billion. I have your disclosure sheet, the one you released last week when you announced. That obviously puts the number more than double that, at $8.7 billion. Are you going to release all the backup data to prove that number, your number, $8.7 billion in net worth?
I have to release tremendous amounts of information. I don't even know what it is, but it doesn't matter, because frankly, I'm worth a tremendous amount. I built a great company. And I'm not doing that in a braggadocious way. I have to release numbers. And I'm just saying that this is the kind of a person you need to run this country. I built a great company. Forbes doesn't know, and I think they are very nice people, but they don't know what I have. And I think it's fine. By the way, whether it's 4.1 or 10 or more than 10, it doesn't matter. You need that kind of a mind-set to straighten out our country.
Donald Trump, I appreciate your time tonight. Thank you.
Thank you very much, Erin.
Sure.
You're going to learn things and you're going to change. And I have evolved on that issue. I have evolved on numerous issues.
Let me ask you about China, because, as you may or may not know, this is a Trump tie.
Yes.
I bought it for this interview.
Oh, and not only that. I mean, I buy a lot of stuff, because...
But, as you know, they're made in China.
Very beautiful tie, though.
It's a lovely tie.
Yes.
It's made in China.
Correct.
Is it hypocritical at all for you to talk about this...
No, not at all, not at all.
Right.
I talk about my ties in speeches.
Right.
You know, I'm open. I say, my ties, many times, are made in China, not all of them, by the way, but a lot of them are made in China, because they have manipulated their currency to such a point that it's impossible for our companies to compete.
When it comes to outsourcing jobs, which is what this tie would be a representative issue of, one of the issues is that the people in China, the laborers, are paid a lot less and the standards are worse when it comes to the environment and health care and worker safety.
Many problems. I agree with that.
Most of it.
And now...
Yes.
The problem...
American -- American Apparel makes stuff here.
And just so you understand, I know you bring that up, but I put ties in my speeches.
It just seems interesting, because you dinged Ford for manufacturing their cars in Mexico.
I do. No, no, no, I don't ding them. I say, congratulations. I think it's a great deal, but I wouldn't let you do it. I wouldn't let them manipulate their currency, because that's what they do.
You talked about building a wall and having Mexico pay for it.
Yes.
So, you would cut off business or impose tariffs unless they built the wall?
I would do something very severe unless they contributed or gave us the money to build the wall. I would build it. I would build it very nicely. I'm very good at building things.
Can we talk about ISIS for one second?
Yes.
The -- I think you said that you want to bomb the oil fields in Iraq...
Yes.
... to take on ISIS?
The only way you're going to beat them is that. You know why they're rich? Because they have the oil. Now, if you remember...
They have the oil in Syria, though.
They have some oil in Iraq.
There's a refinery that they're fighting with the Iraqis over.
They're fighting, and they're going to get it. They're fighting with Iraq. They're going to get it. When are the -- the Iraqis will throw up their arms, they will leave, and they have -- it's just one of those things.
But I don't think Iraq -- I don't think the government of Iraq would want us to bomb their oil fields.
The government of Iraq? There is no government in Iraq. The so-called government in Iraq went to Iran to meet with Iran. Iran is going to take over Iraq. That's as simple as that. OK? As simple as that.
I don't know that Iraq, the government of Iraq, or whatever you want to call them, would support our bombing the oil fields in Iraq since...
Who cares?
OK.
I don't care about the government of Iraq. They're corrupt. The government -- the government of Iraq is totally corrupt. Who cares?
You're pro-choice or pro-life?
I'm pro-life. I'm sorry.
Where are you?
I'm traditional marriage. It is changing rapidly.
I'm not asking you to explain your divorces, but -- but...
No, I know. No, I'm just saying it was -- I blame myself because my business was so powerful for me. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing.
But what do you say to a lesbian or a gay man who are married, and say...
I really don't say anything.
His approach to you seems to be not taking you seriously, his campaign not taking you seriously.
Trust me, he takes me seriously.
No, but in terms of him not taking you seriously, what do you say?
Oh, I -- you know he takes me seriously. And his people have -- believe me, he takes me seriously.
Why do you say that?
Because they call.
And what do they say?
What would you think?
Stop it, stop attacking Jeb?
They -- you know what? They take me so seriously, and they do call and they write. And just believe me, they take me very seriously.
Well, I don't know if anybody who is going to negotiate with ISIS.
Well, you could bring them to a point. Look, the whole ISIS thing has to be ended. It's got to be stopped. We have to stop that. What's going on over there is incredible.
Let me ask about the other side of the aisle, Hillary Clinton. I was surprised to read that Hillary actually went to your wedding.
She did.
How do you -- are you worried at all that somebody who has given money to Hillary, she was at your wedding, that...
No. I give money to everybody.
So, you will argue to voters, yes, I gave money to Reid and Pelosi to help recapture Congress in 2006.
I'm a business. You know, I was in business. I built a great company. They always treated me nicely. We need that in Washington. We have total gridlock.
So you will argue to voters, yes, I gave money to Reid and Pelosi to help recapture Congress but this is what we need, more bipartisan --
I'm a conservative Republican. I'm a very conservative person, actually. But I get along with everybody. I would be more successful in beating Hillary, assuming that she gets it, which I think she probably will. Although --
Who knows?
Who knows? I mean if you go back a few years she was going to get it before Obama came along.
Sure.
That was -- you know, that was like a dead -- that was a done deal.
Absolutely.
Stranger things have happened.
Donald Trump, thank you so much for spending time with us.
Thank you very much.
But why now? Why now. They don't have you as a talent, ok. But they could still do business with you. And if you don't prevail in the presidential race, you could come back, not now, because they have sacked you. So I'm not understanding why they did it. Do you? Did they say to you why they did it? Hey, Donald this is why we let you go.
They really -- I don't even think they know themselves. I think they're weak and I think they're afraid of --
Did you talk to anybody over there about it. Did they -- who did you talk to?
They called me. I don't want to say.
All right.
And if I get elected I will make this country great again, Bill. We are right on the border.
Why is he beating you then?
I have absolutely no idea. Maybe it's the Bush name. But the last thing we need is another Bush. But I will tell you, I'm a little surprised that he would be in the position he's in. Look, I'm right behind him and I think we'll do very well. But I'm surprised, if anybody, I'm surprised it would be him.
Yes, but, Donald, what thought that publicly though?
I'm getting notes from other participants.
Yes.
I don't mean, like, 500 people or something. Tens of thousands of people over the years.
Yes.
And to this day, I mean, I'm building the post office on Pennsylvania Avenue. I'm doing -- I just finished Doral in Miami, you know, hundreds of acres in the middle of Miami. And then I'm not supposed to be on the stage by a politician that hasn't done a good job?
You're going to stay on this long enough to be on the stage for these debates?
Of course I will. Why would I ever get out? I want to see the country thrive. Our country is being run by people that don't know what they're doing. I want to see as make great trade deals so that instead of China, taking all of our jobs, which they're doing now, so many, I mean, it's a one-sided deal.
Yes.
They're sending stuff to us. If we're sending stuff to them, it's almost impossible to get it in.
I want to talk to you...
Take a look at the deficits we have with China and with Japan. And, by the way, with Mexico. Mexico is -- I love the Mexican people. I've had a great relationship with Mexico and the Mexican people. But...
Let me talk to you about that.
... and I'm really disappointed. Don, I'm really disappointed in our leadership not in Mexico. I wish they were more involved in these deals. Because what's happened is the Mexican leaders and negotiators are out-negotiating our people because our people are not smart.
All right.
And they it a lot of our businesses.
Well, let's talk about that.
They're taking our jobs away.
Let's talk about Mexico. I don't mean to cut you off, but let's talk about Mexico.
All right.
And you did mention NBC not being happy. They cut ties with you yesterday -- today because of your comments about Mexican immigrants. Another company...
Because they're weak. You know, they cut ties because they're weak.
Who? NBC, do you think?
If we -- and it's very sad to see but that's it. Because I'm talking not about Mexico. I'm talking about illegal immigration and it has to be stopped, Don, in this country.
OK.
It's killing our country.
Why did you have to say that they're rapists, though, Donald? Why did you have to say they're rapists, Donald?
Who's racist?
Yes.
And it was in the Huffington Post. I said, let me get some of these articles because I've heard some horrible things. I deal a lot of talking with people on the border patrols.
Yes.
They're incredible people. They love our country. They're incredible.
I want to get some clarification.
And they call me serious. No, but, Don, all you have to do is go to Fusion and pick up the stories on rape and it's unbelievable when you look at what's going on. So, all I'm doing is telling the truth.
I've read the -- I've read The Washington Post. I've read the Fusion. I've read the Huffington Post. And that's about women being raped. It's not about criminals coming across the border or entering the country.
Well, somebody's doing the raping, Don. I mean, you know -- I mean, somebody's doing just think women are being rape. Well, who's doing the raping? Who's doing the raping?
Yes.
How can you say such a thing? So, that's -- look. The problem is you have to stop illegal immigration coming across the border. You have to create a strong border, Don.
Yes.
If you don't, we don't have a country.
OK.
True. I was told that they said they're under pressure and I said you know what, let's fold it up. True.
Yes.
So, and it's all because of currency manipulation.
Why didn't you end that relationship sooner than if you had issues with it?
When I heard that they were under pressure, I said let's end it. I didn't care. It's just small.
And not with China.
It's a peanut. But you know what, when I heard because they were folding under pressure.
That's it.
They can't handle pressure.
All right.
A lot of people can. By the way, I've had some calls from people they're fantastic. They're tough. They're smart. And they were put under pressure and they said, Don, no way.
Yes.
And they just ride it through. I've had this all of my life. You have to ride it through. Macy's was unable to handle pressure. They folded like dogs.
What did you think about the president's speech?
I thought it was excellent. I thought it was -- I'm not a fan of the president because I think he's hurting our economic development. You know, our real unemployment rate is probably 19 to 21 percent, etcetera, etcetera. I thought his speech was excellent. And I loved when he started to sing.
Yes.
You know, a case like China, they take our money, they take our jobs, and then they loan the money back to us. We owe China $1.4 trillion right now.
Yes.
We owe Japan $1.3 trillion right now.
Yes.
It's ridiculous. They sell -- Japan sells us cars. They come into these massive ships in L.A. You see them coming in. I mean, it's like, you wouldn't believe it. I've never seen anything like it. The size of these ships and then we owe them money.
Yes.
They make a fortune and yet, we owe them money. Think about it. And we pay interests to Japan. We pay interests to China. So, what we need, Don, is we need jobs. We have to have jobs. And we have to create incentives for people who want to work.
He's the first one. But I want to ask you, the republican field is shaping up to be in the episode of The Apprentice. Really, 14 announced candidates now, at least two more to come this month all buying for attention. Which candidate would you fire first and why?
Well, I think I'd fire a lot of them. Actually I don't want to use names because I don't want to insult anybody. But I think I'd fire a lot of them. There a lot of people that just don't even have a chance. I mean, it's ridiculous. But...
Like?
Well, I don't want to say that. I want to be a nice person, OK? I've just driven all my life to be nice. But actually people do like me. I love charity, I love giving to charity, but, you know, I don't want to ruin any...
Yes.
Because this guy will never be able to make our country great. He doesn't have the energy. He doesn't have what it takes. And, you know, again, not nice to say, but I'm being blunt because we have no choice. We have to do something to bring our country back.
So, do you feel that you're mischaracterized...
But these poll numbers that just came out, I mean, some of the media really it's been very nice to watch and they've given me a lot of credit for it.
Is there anything you'd like to clear up while I have you here?
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.
Donald Trump, thank you.
Thank you very much, Don.
Donald, nice to talk to you.
Hello, Greta.
Donald?
Yes?
Why not be a leader?
I tell you what -- I thought I was. One of the things, if you look at the announcement, one of the reasons I said, let's give it up, is because I felt very uncomfortable having ties made in China. The reason they are made in China is because they manipulates their currency to such an extent that people in the United States cannot compete with China. We don't have a leader that even knows what it means to say currency manipulation. So between China and Japan and so many other countries, including Mexico, by the way, which is doing a tremendous number on us. Now, I have to say, I have great love for the Mexican people and the spirit of the Mexican people. I have respect for Mexico. I'm not angry at Mexico. I'm angry at our country for being so stupid in trade their negotiations with Mexico, China and Japan, and everybody that does business with us.
Well, we really have not heard a real articulate plan from any of the candidates in terms of immigration. What's your plan? How are you going to make it impenetrable?
My plan is to build a wall and it wouldn't have to be necessarily complete because there is some areas where you don't need the wall. There are some areas where you'd have your various -- you'd have the military and they'd be able to block it very easily. But basically, we would build a wall and I'm very good building walls and building things and building buildings and this would be easy to do. I look at the numbers that these are characters came up for a wall and it's ridiculous. It should cost a really good job. It could cost one-third of the numbers I'm looking at and that's what I do for a business. That's what I do for a living. We need security at the border. We have to stop the illegals from coming in. They're coming in and lots of bad things are happening when they're coming in and not all these people are lovely, nice people, believe me.
And yet, those comments sparked a lot of controversy and pushback. Obviously, they canceled the Miss Universe Pageant. You are suing Univision. What are you looking to accomplish?
Well, I have a contract and it's a binding contract. There are no termination rights. You know, I'm pretty good with contracts in all fairness and it's a contract with Univision. And you know, one of the saddest things is we have 51 beautiful, wonderful girls, women down in Louisiana right now and they got there a few days ago and this was canceled without any thought to these women. Some of these women worked their whole life to get into this position where they can become Miss USA. We're talking now about the Miss USA pageant, which airs in two weeks from Sunday. And they fought their whole life to get there and all of a sudden, nobody thought about it from NBC and I told them about it. I said what about the women that are all arriving right now. They said well, we don't care. They don't care. They couldn't care less. These are cold-hearted people. They know I'm right. They don't like it and it's a problem. But in the meantime, I go up in the polls, I go out, I get biggest audiences, I get the biggest standing ovations by far of anybody, nobodies close. And we'll see what happens.
And you were talking earlier, during the break, about a new CNN poll that you say you have risen in.
Well, I hear there's a new CNN poll where I went up even higher than I was. So you know, I'm in second place. I don't get George -- you know, when you look at Bush, I don't get Jeb Bush. He was responsible for the appointment, in my opinion, because he was close to him, with Justice Roberts and Roberts gave us Obamacare. He voted in favor of it twice. He could have killed it and Obamacare is going to be a disaster for the business community, for people and for the country. So, I don't get Jeb Bush at all and he's at one and I'm a two and a lot of people are very far behind. So, it's interesting poll.
Well, you said you don't get Jeb, and, you know, you've talked about some of the other candidates, but Donald, do you worry that you're attacking people in the GOP among others and are actually hurting your own party? I mean let's say you don't win, you are hurting the chances of others. Do you care more about making sure people know how you fell about Jeb and the others than, in fact, beating for example Hillary?
No, I don't really think in terms of that. I'm thinking more in terms of winning, I'm thinking in making our country great again. Our country's a mess. We're being beaten in trade, we're being beaten so badly and in jobs and manufacturing. They're taking everything out of the country; they're stripping us. So, I really want to win it because I know it can be turned around. And, you know, my theme is make America great again. We can make America great again, but these guys are not going to do it.
But, they don't want you on The Apprentice now Donald. They've said they're going to do The Apprentice without you. So, I mean, are you going to sue NBC?
Oh no. Now, now they don't. No, they don't because first of all, I told them I'm not doing it, they didn't tell me. I told them I'm not doing it because I'm going to run for President and when you run for President, or when you run for any political office, you can't do a television show. So, I told them and you know what, it's a little bit sad because I had a great relationship with them and then they really dropped these young women like hot potatoes. It was terrible what they did with that. So, we'll see what happens. You know, NBC will be next to come. We're looking at it very seriously and we will make a determine in what -- determination. But the Univision's very interesting because they had a contract that we did -- that we signed in January, a very lengthy contract. They competed against Telemundo and others. They got it. It has no termination rights.. They haven't even sent us a letter. They just said that you can't do that. You know, it doesn't work that way.
So, you didn't have the -
So, I brought a very big suit and I think we'll be victorious in the suit. A lot of lawyers say it's very good. In fact, they had a CNN lawyer, who's very respected, last night go over and said, wow, this is really a real suit. He had a copy of the contract.
Right.
So, I told them that. They were not happy with that. We did really well last year, we had wonderful ratings last year. They'd thought I would do it, I ran for President. They were not happy with me running for President. Oh and addition to that, if you look, they own MSNBC, which is a total disaster.
Right.
It's a ratings disaster. They're very liberal, they hate Trump and, you know, they're I would say sleepy eyes Chuck Todd. They're man on "Meet the Press" was a total catastrophic. He's at "Meet the Press" and "Meet the Press" is doing very badly. So I would say that they have a slightly liberal tent and we will see what happens. But, I've had a -- you know, the one thing is I will say, for 12 years, I've had a great relationship with NBC and it's a shame that they had to do what they did to with the pageants because what they did with the pageants was wrong. The Apprentice is fair game because I told them a long time ago, I'm not doing it.
I understand. I got to get to some of the issues of the day because I want to know what you would do in Greece story. But first, people did criticize you, Donald, for making it personal. You just mentioned Chuck Todd. You also mentioned Brian Williams in a tweet.
I did, yes, I did. They keep Brian Williams, who's a, you know, open liar. Brian Williams lied like as much as you can lie. He made up stories. He was their main announcer and then they take him back. Do they think he's really going to change? I doubt it. They have Al Sharpton, they have lots of people. So, you know, if they want controversy, they certainly have the people. But with us, I make a very straight and legitimate statement about the illegal immigrants that are pouring into the country. We don't even know where they're going. Some are causing tremendous problems in the country. Everybody agrees with me. I mean, many people agree with me. I went to New Hampshire last night. We had this largest -- really large crowd of people that came up. They were all for Trump.
Right.
And you know, we're polling great in New Hampshire and Iowa and everywhere else Maria. It's like, it's a crazy that NBC did, but -
Yes, I see that.
They're on the other side of the boat here.
What do you think is most important issue America faces right now, Donald? I mean, when you look at all of issues from foreign policy to economic policy and beyond, what do you think is the No. 1 issue and that you would want to focus on as president?
Well, what I would be focused on, better than anybody and it's not even close, ad this came out in a poll No. 1 every category, the economics and jobs, But I think the most important issue is nuclear if you want the truth. I think that the powers of weapons today is so massive that the United States has to focus on that. I don't think we are focusing only it enough. We are doing a very weak and pathetic deal. It looks like if that deal gets done, it's a very bad thing. They have to make it -- they have to double down on the sanctions. They have to make it much, much stronger with the sanctions, the deal has to be much better, with Iran.
But --
But nuclear is a really tremendous problem hanging over the world.
Donald, you talked about current administration, you talked about Jeb Bush. I haven't heard you say anything about Hillary.
Well, I know Hillary very well. I think Hillary has some difficulties.
Donald, yep. Thanks so much, Donald. Good to talk with you.
Thank you very much, Maria.
Donald Trump.
Great honor. Thank you.
Now that you're at second place in the polls. Political and historic recording republicans including Ari Fleischer, the former Bush's White House spokesman, calls you roadside accident. He tarnishes everyone. Irresponsible. Divisive. Hurtful. Does that hurt your feelings?
No. I mean, Ari is somebody that nobody respects; nobody has any respect for him. I'm surprised you even waste your time quoting him. I'm number two. I'm doing well. I'm going up. And people take me very seriously and they call me and they want to meet with me at the top level of the Republican Party. And frankly, I'm the one that's going to bring back health to the country. I'm going to make America great again. Politicians aren't going to do that. And everybody takes me very seriously.
Speaking of The Apprentice NBC this week announcing its severing its relationship with you over your comments on Mexican immigrants. First of all, why -- when you hit back on NBC why did you drag Brian Williams into it?
Well, I think that they protect Brian Williams and he went around lying and telling things that weren't so and I think probably he shouldn't be on. But, you know, that's up to him. I actually think he shouldn't have done it to be honest. I think he should have gone someplace else. But it was just something that I thought it was appropriate. You know, you could bring up other names, too.
Does it tarnish you that a bit that this network that you partnered with so successfully over the years now says, you know, it's protecting, preserving its dignity by not doing business with you anymore.
Well, they were very unhappy because we had a great season last season with The Apprentice. They had a 2.4 rating was reported and we did very, very well. They were very unhappy when I ran because when you run you're not allowed to, as you know, do a show.
Right.
So, they were not happy with me, I will tell you that. And then when they saw the last week or two the poll numbers so strong, you know, they figured well, I'd run now get out fast and still do with the show. When they saw my poll numbers, one of them actually called me and said, wow, you're not getting any time soon, are you? And you know, they renewed the The Apprentice.
Right.
This was renewed and they thought I would do it. And I can't do that. I want to make the country great again. I can't do that if I'm doing The Apprentice. So, they were not thrilled with me.
On the Mexican comments, why not say, maybe I went too far? Poor choice of words or even, I'm sorry.
I don't have to say that. Look, the Mexican border is a sieve. People are pouring through our country -- into our country. We don't know who they are, where they are, they come from all over the world. Not Mexicans. I employ thousands of Mexicans. I've employed over the years many thousands of Mexicans.
Right.
I love the Mexican people. They're fantastic and everybody knows that. But in terms of the border, it's a disgrace. Either we have a border or we don't have a country. You know, you can't have a country without borders. And people are coming in and some of those people -- and I read it even yesterday there was a huge article about the tremendous crime that's taking place. It's like a crime wave. It's one of the most dangerous places on earth. And I bring that up all of a sudden I'm a bad person.
I'm not disputing it this question of thought.
So, if you're not disputing it, why not say it?
Because it's the question of your tone and it offended a lot of people.
Excuse me, I read an article yesterday from Fusion, which is owned by Univision.
Right.
Because I'm told and they talked about many of the women that cross the border are being raped. Many of them. A tremendous percentage. Actually it said 80 percent. That's hard to believe it could be 80 percent. But they said the women coming across the border are raped. This is done by Fusion, it was printed in The Huffington Post, no friend of mine.
Right.
And I use the word rape and all of a sudden everyone goes crazy. It says 80 percent of the women, which is hard to believe to be honest with you. But there is tremendous -- so...
I think by in large...
I can never apologize, Howard.
Yes.
I can never apologize for the truth. I don't mind apologizing for things. But I can't apologize for the truth. I said tremendous crime is coming across. Everybody knows that's true. And it's happening all the time. So, why when I mention all of a sudden I'm a racist. I'm not a racist. I don't have a racist bone in my body.
So, I think over the years the press has been pretty good to you as you build your reputation as a worldwide deal maker and builder and TV star. I wonder though, if you're used to the extra kind of intense scrutiny that comes with being a presidential candidate.
I think I am.
Yes?
I mean, I've been out here a long time doing this.
What if this gets really personal? I live here in New York in early '90s when the tabloids went haywire over your breakup with Ivana and your relationship with Marla Maples. What if this gets dredged up and people say Trump he's a good role model.
Look, everybody knows me. I've had an amazing life, I built an amazing business and actually they said, oh, he never said what his business worth is. It's actually a much higher than the number I gave.
What, you're underestimating your worth?
I actually, yes. I actually underestimate it. In fact, there was a case where in Iowa where The Des Moines Register did a story where I actually said, I have stores that have worth more than Mitt Romney jokingly. And the reporter said, can I use that? Because I said it off the record.
Right.
I have a story -- that's why and then they actually used it. I said I don't care, use it. So, the next day, they do a story that, oh, Trump exaggerated. Because, well, then they went out and did a value on the store and the value on the store was many times. It was the Gucci store downstairs.
When you run for president...
And they actually apologized to me which was sort of interesting.
Presidents don't run the economy. You know that.
Oh, I think the president has a lot to do with the economy. Absolutely. I mean, the trade deals. The new trade package is a disaster. The president has everything to do with the economy.
Donald Trump, thanks very much.
Thank you, Howard.
Donald, thank you for joining me.
Hello, Greta.
Always good to talk to you. And, Donald, you made news again today, ESPN and NASCAR is the next two to, I don't know, to slap you around a little bit.
Well, you know, it's really amazing. Big headlines, NASCAR, You know what NASCAR was, they were renting a ballroom at Trump National Durrell for an evening, and they lost a big deposit. So now I will rent it to somebody else, maybe somebody getting married which would be nice. And so I get two for the price of one. And with ESPN, you know that was a big deal all over the world, ESPN drops Trump. You know what it was, it was a golf outing at my golf course in Los Angeles, it was a simple golf outing which by the way, they left a big fat beautiful deposit on the table, and they have to go to a course that is not even nearly as good. That's one of the best courses in the world, so you know, it's unbelievable. You hear NASCAR, the ESPN leaving Trump. One was a banquet and the other one was a simple golf outing, and by the way, now other people will play golf so I will get two fees instead of one. The whole thing is crazy.
Do they call you ahead of time or how do you learn about this?
Well, I heard about it and you know one is a banquet. People don't call me up when somebody doesn't go to a banquet, so it's not a big deal. And by the way they will both be back next year as soon as things blow over.
Are you sure? Are you sure? You've had, Macy's, NBC, Univision, I mean they're coming at you from all different directions.
Well, you know its things that I handle. And why are they coming at me? Because I'm against illegal immigration, because I speak up for the country, I'm against illegal -- if you look at it, what's very simple, illegal immigration, I'm totally opposed to it. You see what happened in San Francisco with that beautiful young woman who was shot standing with her father by a man that shouldn't have been here. We threw him out five times and Mexico sends him back in. In my opinion, the Mexican government forced him back in. They force many criminals back into our country and that's what I have been talking about, and frankly, people have given me great credit for talking about it. I brought a subject to light. But because I'm against illegal immigration, these people bailed because they want to be politically correct. Yeah, I think they will be back.
Let me bring you back -- let me bring you to -- there's a Washington Post article about the Trump Hotel. Now, I was in there a short time ago with you and I actually talked to the workers with you and they seemed -- I have to admit they were very pleased to talk to you. They seemed very happy to have a job with you. Now there is some backlash against you from a number of them. And included in the report today is that many of them came to the United States illegally, became legal, now they are working for you. What do you say about that?
Well, I think it's wonderful if they came here and they are legal. But, I know the company that I hired, which is highly respected, one of the biggest in the world to build it, and we put very big strong pressure on them. They watched to make sure they are legal. And if you read the article carefully, they don't have anybody illegal, they have people that ultimately they were illegal, they became legal, according to the article. I just read the article 10 minutes ago. And it seems to me that everything is very good because they were legal. I didn't notice where anybody illegal was working in the building.
Is there any -- are you considering at all -- since you are getting heat from every single direction, is there any chance that you will get out of the race with this?
No. I love it. I'm bringing to fore and getting a lot of credit for it, lots of different elements that are very important. We have incompetent leadership. We have leaders that don't know anything about negotiating. We are getting killed by China. We are getting killed by Mexico. We are getting killed by Japan and killed by Saudi Arabia makes $1 billion a day, Greta. And if they have a problem, we go and defend Saudi Arabia. We get nothing. We are a bunch of very, very foolishly-led people. So I think I'm doing very well. I will tell you I'm getting a lot of credit on the other hand. You know, the way you asked that negative question, I'm getting a lot of credit on the other hand from people that say I'm the only one that's speaking the truth. And I think that's why I'm so high in the polls.
I think what the Republican Party may be worrying about is that -- because you are such a maverick, is that in the event that you don't get the nomination and that you have a strong following as you do, is that somehow you become a spoiler and go rogue on the Republican Party. And that's why I ask you would you ever consider it or -- will you support the Republican nominee no matter who it is?
Many people have asked me to do that, and I will say that I love the Republican Party. I think they are making tremendous mistakes. I think they are far too weak on immigration. I think they are weak on a lot of things. I watched Jeb Bush, I think it's pathetic what's going on his stance on common core. He is in favor of Washington educating his children, his weak stance on immigration. He said it's an act of love. What kind of stuff is that? That's baby stuff. So I will tell you I have many people that have asked me to go independent, and I think I would do very well if I went independent. But that's not my thinking. My thinking is to run as a Republican.
Donald, always nice to talk to you.
Thank you very much. Have a good time.
Let's talk immigration since that's the hot topic. Yesterday, there was news coming out from The Washington Post about your hotel site in D.C. There are a lot of immigrants working on that, including some who say --
Legal immigrants.
When was the last time you were at the border?
I've been to the border three or four times over the years. And I have many people that live around the area. I'm going to Arizona this weekend where they want to talk to me because Arizona is -- somebody said I'm the most popular person in Arizona because of my stance. And I'm going to be there this weekend.
When was the last time that you were there?
Probably three years ago.
We have a lower incarceration rate for Mexican immigrants and illegal immigrants than we do any U.S.-born citizens.
It's a wrong statistic. Go check your numbers. It's totally wrong. It sounds good.
It's Pew Research.
It sounds good. It's a wrong statistic. Check your numbers.
Why -- why should people believe your numbers when you come out and say they're committing crimes and they're in our jails and they're murdering us and taking our jobs? A few years ago, you led the birther movement. You sent investigators out to Hawaii to find out whether or not Obama was not born here. And it turned out to not be true.
Well, I don't know. According to you it's not true. I don't know.
Do you have a plan for ISIS?
I do have a plan actually.
What is it?
I would knock the hell out of oil areas because they're rich as can be. They're building a hotel in Iraq. They took over a hotel. They're renovating a hotel in Iraq. They're renovating another hotel in a different location. They have nothing but money. It is coming out of their ears and they're getting most of their money from oil.
What about civilians?
I'm talking about oil. I'm talking about oil areas. I'm not talking about civilian areas.
Civilians are near oil areas.
Oh, give me a break, Katy. Go ahead. Next question.
What about people that walk into churches and shoot people, or walk in the schools and shoot people?
They're sick people. Those are very, very sick people. They'll be able to get something somewhere.
You're for the second amendment. Do you have a gun in.
I have the license to have a gun. Yes, I do.
Do you own one?
Yes, I do.
Do you use it? Gun range?
That's none of your business. It's really none of your business. I have a license to have a gun.
Gun control.
What are you talking about?
Or stronger background checks.
Yes, I have a gun. Excuse me, yes, I have a gun and yes, I have a permit to have a gun.
Stronger back ground checks. What about that? Is there any steps that you would make it harder to get a gun?
The problem is once you get into that, you start getting into a situation, the slippery slope where all of a sudden, you're going to violate the Second Amendment. I don't want to do anything on violate the Second Amendment. To me, the Second Amendment is very important.
So, you will release your financials on time.
Yes. I think we're going to have it on time. In fact --
Where did you get your money from?
I made it the old-fashioned way, in real estate, in real estate. I made a lot of money doing everything I did. I made a lot of money with The Apprentice. I made a lot of money in real estate. I made a lot of money -- everything I did. I've had great success.
If it's hurting you, why do it?
Katy, let me just say, the press is very, very dishonest. And I think people are wiser than the press.
Why wouldn't you keep your manufacturing here? Your ties, your suits, why would you not have them made here?
Because China so manipulates their currency that it's very hard to find companies that can do business in the United States.
What do you think of Hillary Clinton as the president if she wins the nomination --
I think she would be a terrible president. She was the worst Secretary of State in the history of our nation. Why would she be a good president? I think she would be a terrible president.
She says you're too divisive on immigration. The Republican Party is too divisive on immigration.
Hillary is weak on immigration. I may be divisive on immigration, but she's weak on immigration, which is far worse. Hillary would let everybody come in -- killer, criminals, drug dealers, everybody. If you listen to Hillary, everybody is going to be flowing through the nation. They are sort of now any way. But if you listen to Hillary, she is so weak on immigration. We will have a crime wave like you've never seen before.
Immigration is down. Why is this such a big topic for you right now?
Immigration is a very big topic. Take a look at all the crime that's being committed. Go take a look at -- look, I'm going to Arizona --
The research says the crime does not match what you're saying.
It depends on whose research.
The research -- the Pew Research, which is independent, says --
Don't be naive. You're a very naive person.
The Pew Research says that there for immigrants on the whole --
Come on, try getting it out. Try getting it out.
I'll get it out.
I mean, I don't know if you're going to put on this television, but you don't even know what you're talking about. Try getting it out. Go ahead.
Immigrants commit less crime than U.S.-born citizens. There are less immigrants on our jails than --
You know what, number one, I disagree with it, and number two, whether it is true or not, illegal immigrants -- I'm talking about illegal immigrants. I'm talking about illegal. I'm an immigrant, you're an immigrant, we're all immigrants...
If you found out that you had an illegal immigrant working for you and they are a hard worker, how would you treat them?
I think that I would treat them probably -- I would have to tell them, you have to go back, I think.
Who pays for that wall?
Mexico.
How do you get Mexico to pay that wall?
Only if I'm president.
How does that happen?
Because Mexico is making a fortune off the United States. I would get them to pay for the wall. Believe me they will pay for the wall.
How high would the wall be?
I will make that wall impenetrable. Impenetrable. You don't have to worry about how high it will be and Mexico will pay for that wall.
OK.
Thank you very much.
You know, let me ask you, put the mic back on. I'm going to ask you one more. I forgot to ask it.
What is it?
I want to know why you think voters like you so much and why you're getting big crowds. But your microphone is not on.
That question I can handle.
You're number two. Why do people respond to you so much?
Well, I'm actually number one in Huffington Post and some others and the new polls haven't even come out yet.
do you think it is just name recognition?
No. I think it's the fact that I say things that people agree with.
First of all, Hillary Clinton gave her first interview yesterday in a long, long time. First national interview, she gave to CNN. You give interviews all the time. You are out there. You are talking extemporaneously, why do you think Hillary Clinton is not talking?
Well, Anderson, she has a lot to hide. She gets a subpoena on emails and she -- I mean, from the United States Congress and she gets rid of the emails and her server and everything gone.
She said yesterday in the interview she didn't get a subpoena.
Well, I mean, they said they issued a subpoena. But you are right. I mean, she handled it like, you know, what is going on? How can you do that? She has a lot to hide. She doesn't want to talk to the press. Look, she was the worst Secretary of State in the history of the United States.
But you used to donate, gave a lot of money to her over the years?
Sure, I was a businessman, guess I still am. But I was a businessman. I was with everybody. Everybody loved me. When I called them they always treated me well. And that's part of the game. And that's part of what's wrong with this country. Because as a businessman I could have gotten anything from anybody. And that is part of the problem. Lobbyists, donors, special interests.
Is that why you were donating money to people you donated to? Because you donated to Democrats I think in 2006. You gave $20,000 to the democratic congressional campaign fund.
Democrats and Republican.
Thousand to the Republicans.
I have given millions. I have given millions to everybody.
So do you give though based on principles or do you give based on who is going to do thing for you politically?
They all love me. Let's put it that way. They all loved me. I'm a very, very -- I did very nicely in life. And frankly, you give -- and it is part of the problem. And I talk about it all the time.
So even though you are doing it, you say it is a problem.
Well, I'm saying this. They won't necessarily do what's right for the country. They'll do what's right for their special interests, their donor, their lobbyists, etcetera. Not good for the country.
But you know, when you get on the stage during the debates and your Republican challengers are going to say look you are all over the place politically. You say you are a conservative Republican. You are giving money to Hillary Clinton, Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi.
I give money to everybody. And that's part of the problem we have in the country also.
So, you weren't giving money based on political beliefs, but you are giving money based on currying favor like in many people do.
People love me. And you know what, I have been very successful. Everybody loves me.
Politically, the other thing they're going to say is you are a flip-flopper, politically. You say now you are a conservative Republican, smoking gun, because that is 87 with your registration record, you were a Republican, and you were independent, then you are Democrat for eight years, then you are unaffiliated then you were a Republican.
You have to look at what Ronald Reagan did.
He switched around, too.
Not so much different.
I got to ask you about a couple things in the news. Washington Post as you know say some of the workers building this beautiful hotel that you are building down in Washington, D.C. are illegal. They talked to 15 workers. They said, a number of the 15 came here illegally through asylum, they're now legal. A number said they're illegal. Isn't it hypocritical for you saying, illegal immigration is killing this country to be employing illegal immigrants?
Well, I read the story. And by the way that story does not name any names. I love them if they could give us names. But they said they spoke to one or two, but they don't name them. I don't even know if it is true.
Doesn't the buck stop with you though?
Yes it does.
You are paying their salary.
Absolutely. We have gone out of our way to make sure that everybody in that building is legal. And we do have some that were that became legal. Wait a minute. We have some, many, I think that became frankly, me, you, everybody, I mean, ultimately we were all sort in the group of immigrants, right? But we have done that to the absolute letter of the law. We're very, very careful.
The Washington Post can go there and talk to 15 people and find some illegal immigrants.
They haven't shown us anything. I wish they would give us names. We'll get them out immediately.
This isn't the first time, though, this has been an issue. Daily Beast today, there is an article. I don't know if you have seen it. The headline says and they're talking about the building we are sitting in right now. They're saying Trump tower was built on undocumented immigrant backs.
How many years ago was that?
This was '75, 35 years ago.
They said 35 years age.
But this was a court case, 200 illegal immigrants. Polish workers.
Anderson, I hire a can tractor. The contractor then hires the subcontractor. They have people. I don't know, I don't remember that was so many years ago, 35 years ago they said we had.
Court case settled in 1999. You settled with them.
That's all right. I mean, that's fine. I remember the case, frankly. I remember it very well. We hired contractors. The contractor, very highly prestigious, very good contractor, they go out hire subcontractors. Sometimes the subcontractors will have people working but you know it's pretty far down the line.
When you say looking at seriously would there be a pathway to citizenship or I mean, you are talking 11 million at the very least.
It is too early for me to say. And when you say citizenship, the most we would be talking about was legal. But let me just tell you before I even think about that. We have to build a, we have to build a wall, a real wall. Not a wall that people walk through.
Let me ask you --
I'm talking about the government. Excuse me.
What evidence do you have that the government send their --?
Everybody knows it. This man or this animal that shot the wonderful, that beautiful woman in San Francisco, this guy was pushed out by Mexico. We bring them back and they push them out. Mexico pushes back people across the border that are criminals that are drug dealers.
So if the article that you are basing this on this fusion article that you have cited.
That's just one of many articles. That talks about 80 percent rapes. But that's not it. Just look at homeland security reports. Look at all of the reports.
So you don't believe the studies. You said that there is a correlation --
Well, I don't believe in the sense, number one. But even if the studies were correct. I'm not talking about correlation. When you have illegal immigrants coming in if they commit crime they're not supposed to be here.
You did indicate that the people coming across the border were raping 80 percent of the women --
You are putting things. Read the article. Did you pull up the article?
I did. I pulled up the article.
Now, that article was written by fusion, you know who owns fusion?
Yes, Univision.
Univision. You know who I am suing? Univision. And they have a big problem with my lawsuit. So let me just tell you something, Univision comes out like I am some bad person. Univision is being, being sued by me, the thing that they own as fusion, and they're talking about 80 percent rapes. I didn't make that up.
In the article, it says its corrupt officials, it is traffickers, it is gangs, and other migrants inside Mexico.
Whatever it is. But as I said before it is called rape. It is rape. And it is happening. And it is a shame. And it's horrible.
How much has this cost you?
A lot. It cost me a lot.
Can you put a dollar figure on the loss?
It is a lot of money. But fortunately I am very rich. It doesn't matter to me. Does it matter, no? What matters is making America great.
You don't have a dollar figure. This is costing you x amount.
No. You know, it is sort of funny. One of is big headline. Trump loses NASCAR. You know what they were doing, renting a ballroom from me one night. There is banquet hall. And they left a deposit. And now I have it rented already to somebody else.
Let me ask you -- as I said, you have been very vocal in the media. Very accessible. You are on Twitter. There was a tweet that caused you problems that was rescinded. It was a retweet about Jeb Bush's wife. You said, the original tweet said Jeb Bush has to like the Mexican illegals because of his wife. That was somebody else said that. You retweeted it. Did you authorize that? Did you regret that?
No, I didn't authorize it. I don't regret anything. Look, some -- it was a retweet, it wasn't me. It was actually, if you look at it carefully, it was a retweet of a Breitbart story. That was a very good story, a very fair story, but a strong story, very good story. But do I regret -- no, I don't regret it. I mean, you know, look, I would say that he would, if my wife were from Mexico, I think I would have a soft spot for people from Mexico. I can understand that.
Specifically, what would be your strategy?
The situation with ISIS has to be dealt firmly and strongly. When you have people being beheaded. I would love not to be over there. That's not our fight. That's other people's fight. That's revolutions, that's whatever you want to call it, it's religious wars. I would do things that would be so tough that I don't even know if they would be around to come to the table.
What sort of things, though?
I would take away their wealth. I would take away the oil. What you should be doing now is taking away the oil.
What does that mean?
Bomb them. And I'll tell you what I hate about this question. If I win -- if I win. I didn't want to answer this question. And I thought maybe I could go without answering it. Because if you look at the great General George Patton, or General MacArthur, I was a big fan of, any of this great general. They didn't talk about what they did. And I said I hate it. In fact, if you remember when I said I have a plan, but I don't want to talk about it. Everyone said, oh, he really doesn't have a plan. So, I had to do it. But I hate talking about it. Because if I win they know I'm going to do it. If I win I would attack those oil sites that are controlled and owned by -- owned. They're controlled by ISIS. They're taking tremendous money out. They are renovating a hotel in Iraq. Can you believe it?
Wouldn't you be destroying the wealth of Iraq?
No, no, let me tell -- There is no Iraq. There is no Iraq.
The Iraqis might differ with you.
There are no Iraqis. They're broken up into so many different factions.
U.S. troops?
Excuse me. You ever see how fast they put up rigs? These guys are unbelievable. So, I go Exxon Mobile. I go there top five oil companies. They would be in there. They'd be finished so fast.
You think you would get along with Putin?
I think I get along with him fine. I think he would be absolutely fine. He would never keep somebody like Snowden in Russia. He hates Obama. He doesn't respect Obama. Obama doesn't like him either. But he has no respect for Obama. Has a hatred for Obama. And Snowden is living the life. Look if that -- if I'm president, Putin says, hey, boom, you're gone. I guarantee you this.
I think I know the answer to this question, would you accept a vice presidential position if it didn't work out for you as president? I mean you are doing great right now.
I'm doing -- But -- it's not that I wouldn't. It's a phenomenal position. You know, I think it's a very powerful position. It's not for me. I love what I am doing. I would rather be doing this. I am not doing this to be president. I am not doing this to be president. I'm doing this to make America great again.
You rule out the idea of running as an independent party candidate or third party candidate if for some reason you don't get the GOP nomination?
Everybody asks me to do it. I have had so many people saying, would you run as an independent. Would you run as a third party candidate? And I think, you know, they see the kind of votes. I get a lot of votes. The best way of defeating the Democrats and probably Hillary, I think it is going to be Hillary is to run as a Republican. If I do the third party thing it would be I think very bad for the Republicans. I think it would be very bad in terms of beating the Democrats. And we have to win.
George H.W. Bush still points to Ross Perot as being the reason he didn't get reelected. You don't want to be the Ross Perot?
Ross Perot, I've known that -- 90 percent of the vote -- Ross Perot, had he not been there you would have never heard of Bill Clinton. You would have never heard. In my opinion, Bush would have gotten almost 100 percent of those votes. Now, I actually spoke to Bill Clinton once. He said, no, no, it was split 50/50. No. And that's a smart thing for him to say. No way. Had Ross Perot not run you would never have heard of Bill Clinton.
They're phony.
... and 5.6 percent unemployment.
It's twice that.
I'll tell you -- I've always been saying -- I have been saying 20 percent, 21. The other day, I heard somebody actually say 41 percent. Now, what they mean is all these people that gave up looking for jobs, Sean. And it's true.
Yes, only in Washington.
They don't count them. It's a disgrace.
So let me...
So we have to...
Well, let me...
... and we sometimes have to put them in hospitals.
Let me...
And we take care of them. And one other thing.
Go ahead.
The man that killed that magnificently beautiful and wonderful young woman in San Francisco was pushed out of Mexico five times -- five times. He should have been in a jail in Mexico.
Let me...
And what we do is, we have our prisons loaded up and it's ridiculous.
You know that I've been down to the border...
Go ahead.
... almost a dozen times now, horseback, helicopter, boat...
Right.
I had three parents on last night.
... a Jeb Bush that talks about act of love...
Three parents on last night.
That's terrible.
But we're allowing it.
... for 50 years in a jail!
OK...
... things like this to happen. That girl should be alive.
Absolutely.
The young man -- the man's son should be alive right now, shouldn't be you know where. It's so sad what's happening to our country...
We've got two parents...
... in so many ways.
OK.
I'm not a politician. I don't have to say...
You're not thinking about an independent run...
I have to see who wins.
You're thinking about winning this Republican primary. That's what you're thinking about today.
I want to win the Republican -- I want to win because that's our best chance of defeating the Democrats. With that said, everybody wants me to do that. I have had so many people wanting me to do that. Our best chance of defeating the Democrats and getting this country going again is if I win the Republican nomination.
OK.
I will beat Hillary Clinton. And One other thing. I will win the Latino vote. I will win the Hispanics because I'm going to put them to work. I am going to put people back to work. I'm going to win that vote. I have thousands of people working for me, right now, Hispanics working for me. I will win that vote because I'm going to get jobs for people. Hillary's not going to get jobs. And by the way, Jeb Bush is not going to get jobs.
What's next?
More of the same, I'll keep doing my thing. I'll go around to different places, get great receptivity. I get the biggest crowds. I get the biggest standing ovations. You saw that today, I could have been there for 20 minutes and they would have been cheering. So, you'll see more of the same, getting the word out.
Will immigration remain your focus?
No. It's just one of the things. It's not only immigration. It's about trade. They go hand in hand. Immigration is one of the things you have to do. I'm also a moralist. You heard what I said today about health care. I said, I'm sorry, folks, but we have to take care people that don't have money. I know it's not the conservative thing to say, but I got a standing ovation -- and these were very conservative people. We can't let people down when they can't get any medical care, when they're sick and don't have money to go to a doctor. You help them.
So Trump has a heart?
A big heart, let me tell you. Too big.
When did you decide to seize on immigration and make it the thrust of your campaign?
They gave it to me. It wasn't a big part of my announcement speech -- a small paragraph. The Democrats and the enemies lined up and they criticized me for one line where I said Mexico is sending -- I said Mexico is sending. I didn't say people are coming over and they're bad people. They would leave off the 'Mexico is sending' part, chop it and say I said 'rapists' when talking about people.
But when you use a word like rapist...
It is a very rough word. It's OK to use.
Are you looking forward to the debate?
No, not one way or the other. Whatever. I don't look forward or not look forward. It is what it is.
When are you going to file your financial disclosure with the Federal Election Commission?
This week. Do you think Jeb Bush (the former Florida governor) is going to file his statement? I don't know what's going on. I just heard it today that he hasn't filed. I assume he would have been filed. His should be simple, you know, in comparison to mine. I have so many companies and corporations.
Many Republican officials have asked you to tone down your immigration comments. It doesn't seem like you're listening to their advice.
I respect the people in the Republican Party, but this is a very important issue and it can't be toned down. It's an issue that wants to be silenced. Remember I told you the story about the guy they were going after, that killer, and when they heard he was he was an illegal immigrant it was like he was protected? If he were a citizen, they'd put him in jail for life.
How did you come up with "the silent majority" as a theme for your Saturday speech?
I was just thinking about it today. When I heard about this overwhelming -- I'm telling you, it was 500 people at the start and the hotel called us begging to be released. They said they never had anything like this and we had to move the venue. I said to myself, 'That's the silent majority.'
You don't care about the Nixon overtones?
Nah. Nobody remembers that. Oh, is that why people stopped using (the phrase)? Maybe. Nobody thinks of Nixon. I don't think of Nixon when I think of the silent majority. The silent majority today, they're going to vote for Trump. Remember, many Republicans didn't vote for Mitt Romney. He didn't inspire people. They're going to vote for me. And I'll also get the Hispanics, you watch.
What do they see in you?
They see somebody who's going to turn the country around -- somebody who has the ability to turn this country around. They're tired of the incompetence. When you see my statement, you'll be very impressed. That's why it's important. Let's say I was worth $10. People would say, "Who the hell are you?" You understand? They know my statement. Fortune. My book, "The Art of the Deal," based on my fortune. If I didn't make a fortune, who the hell is going to buy "The Art of the Deal"? That's why they watched The Apprentice, because of my great success.
Doesn't the buck stop with you, though?
Yes, it does.
But if The Washington Post  can go there and talk to 15 people and find some illegal immigrants...
They haven't shown us anything. I wish they would give us some names. We would get them out immediately.
But you have got a guy -- you must have a guy on the job site.
We have more than one guy.
Yes.
And we check it probably more carefully than ever job that was ever built.
Marco Rubio: "Trump's comments are not just offensive and inaccurate, but also divisive."
Marco Rubio is somebody who is extremely weak on immigration. He all of a sudden toughens his stance because his poll numbers went down. If he ever got elected, you would have people flowing across the border.
How much has this cost you? I mean..
A lot. Oh, it cost me a lot.
I think I know the answer to this question. Would you accept a vice presidential position...
No.
... if it didn't work out for you for president?
Would I -- look...
Let's talk about the Iran deal. The president said that it's not built on trust, it's built on verification.
It's not true. It's absolutely not true.
So, who's the Obama of this year?
... she's got -- well, it looks like Bernie Sanders. It looks like somebody. She's not doing very well, I can tell you that. Every -- she's getting chopped down every month that the polls come out.
A new poll just came out saying that 40 percent of Republican voters think that you're just doing this for publicity. How do you change their -
That's what I don't understand.
How do you thank change their mind?
Well, I think it's a great thing for me.
Let me...
Go ahead.
I'm not trying to interrupt you. I want to go to the broader question here, though. And one of your major criticisms of your fellow candidates in the Republican Party is pretty much they're career politicians. They've been timid, weak and ineffective.
They are.
When you look at the major issues that our next president will have -- getting jobs for Americans, the debt, the deficit, health care, immigration, all -- education, all of these issues -- national security, which is huge, what -- where are you different?
Trade.
How will you...
Sean, trade.
Here's my question...
I mean, they went up 7 percent. We went -- Sean, we went negative! That means we're getting smaller.
Well, that means if we have another quarter of negative growth, that's called a recession. I want to...
And by the way, with more people. Sean, with more people.
Good point.
We're getting smaller, but we have more people.
How bad do you think America in terms of its shape -- you think about making America great again. That means we're not great now.
We're not great right now. Number one, we lost our number seed is China. China now is the big economic engine. We lost our number one seed to China. That is unthinkable. If you would have gone back six, seven, eight years ago, that was unthinkable. No, we're not. We have infrastructure that's rotting. Sean, I travel all over the world. You go places like, anywhere, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, China, any place, you could name 100, you could name 30 places -- you've got to see the airports. You've got to see the magnificent roads. You have to see the bridges that they have. We're falling apart. Our bridges are falling down. Our infrastructure is falling apart. Then you see hospitals where they spend $2 billion to build a hospital and they can't open it because it doesn't work. Believe me, I could turn this country around so fast, and people would love me for it. That is what they want. And that's why I'm leading in the polls, I think.
I'd like to see America great again. I'd like to see Americans back to work. I'd like to stop robbing future generations. And I'd like to tough on the world stage once more. So I agree, we're in tough shape right now. Mr. Trump, good to see you. Thanks for being with us.
Thank you very much, Sean.
We have more than a few.
But the fact is -- you have too many in your business. You have to restore law and order and you have to be intelligent. You have to bring back the word "intelligence". You have to bring it back because a thing like this shouldn't happen.
All right. You would reorganize all the intel agencies if you were president? You would reorganize them?
Well, I would certainly put people that are the smartest and the best. And we don't have that right now. We have unbelievable law enforcement agencies and amazing people. Some of our most amazing people but we are not letting them do their job, Bill.
Welcome back to MORNING JOE. Let's bring in right now on the phone Donald Trump. Donald, we're going to start today with -- how are you doing this morning first of all, Donald?
I'm doing good. I left New Hampshire last night. We had a tremendous crowd, Joe, as you probably heard. I mean, it was really a tremendous crowd. We had a great evening and I'm here now speaking you to folks, listening to how I'm going to help Bush. Hey Joe, listening to how I'm going to help Bush, nobody believes that. The one that least believes that is Jeb Bush. Believe me.
Well, I think he just said that he may have been wrong.
He is wrong. He is wrong. I mean, these are certified numbers.
OK.
You know, as Mark said yesterday very nicely, I'm not going to be putting in false numbers. These are all certified by a accountant. I made a lot of money. The Apprentice  was a tremendous success. I made a lot of money with it. You know that.
Mr. Trump, Mark Halperin here. I want to ask you two quick political questions if I could. First, you made a big point of trying to get President Obama to release his college records, grades and transcripts. I'm wondering if you would release your records from Wharton?
You know, interestingly, first of all, I don't know. I mean, it's something I've never thought about. He -- nobody else seem to. But the answer is I will certainly think about it. I was a very good student. I went to a great school, the Wharton School of Finance.
So you won't commit today to doing it?
I can -- it's the first time I've ever heard the question. I'll certainly think about it. Wharton, I'm very proud of my record there. I was an excellent student. I will certainly think about it.
All right. Mr. Trump, this is Gene Robinson.
Hi, Gene.
I'm going to keep our aura of good feeling going today. We're on a roll.
Good.
Andrea Mitchell here, Donald.
-- that is very important.
Sorry, Donald. Andrea Mitchell here.
Hi, Andrea.
All right, Donald Trump. We thank you for calling in. Always interesting. Good luck on the campaign trail. We will talk very soon.
Thank you very much.
It'll be over in the chair.
Thank you, thank you. Beautiful, look at that.
Come on over, right there.
Hello.
Second question, this is appropriate to you. What is most important in the next president? political experience or business experience? Who says political?
Both.
Raise their hands. Who says business experience, raise your hands.
I think both.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, because politically correct -- is political...
We have to be able to express ourselves.
But don't we go too far?
Too far?
Don't you feel that you went too far in what you call Mexicans coming across the border?
You're using the word again? Oh, no, not at all. No, I've happy.
Well, it's a great applause line, and obviously, they appreciate it. But referring to people as rapists...
Excuse me, excuse me...
He is a war hero, he's a war hero.
He hit me -- he's not a war hero.
Mr. Trump.
Yes, sir?
Would you go on record today saying that, if you can't get the Republican nomination, you will not run as a third-party candidate?
No. No. I won't go on record as saying that. Look...
Right, I gotta -- again, this is a summit as opposed to a specific political effort. You could afford the lawyers against the IRS, I cannot.
I know, I know.
Did you have -- used to have dinner with your kids most nights?
Yes.
So...
I would have dinner with my kids almost always, and I'm always available to my children. I can be in the middle of the biggest, most important deal. For instance, if Ivanka called me right now, I would say, "Bye bye, Frank, you're a wonderful guy."
OK.
Maybe not, maybe I'd say wait ten minutes. But -- but I was always available to my children and, you know, frankly, I have said it -- I was actually a great father. I was a better father than I was a husband, and the reason is I was a worker. And I had, you know, you mentioned the -- the relationships. They were very good women, but I was always working. I was working. I was creating jobs, I was building jobs, I was doing everything and legitimate stuff. I was working and it was very hard for a woman -- and I blame myself, I don't blame anybody else, but it was a work thing. It wasn't a bad thing, and it's -- it was very hard for anybody to compete against the work, and that was not good. I have learned that.
Your press conferences would take forever.
Well, I'm -- I'm trying to get out the points, Frank. You know, I mean...
So -- again, you -- you've gone into it -- if I don't ask this question, this audience will be disappointed. Straight question, what is your relationship with God?
Well, I pray, I go to church, I -- do I do things that are wrong? I guess so. You know, I'm a business person, I really do well at business, I -- I -- I've done great. I've made some of the great deals. I own some -- I own some of the greatest properties in the world, and my totally...
Does he love America?
I don't know if he loves America. I -- I hope he loves America. I don't want to get into that, I hope so.
Let's go back here -- let's go back to your comment about John McCain --
-- and it's a scandal. And John McCain has done nothing to --
-- what did you mean you -- what did you mean you prefer those who aren't captured?
I want to give them credit because, frankly, they don't get the credit. John McCain gets credit. He was elected a senator, etcetera, etcetera, and we'll give him all the credit. And as in the report, it said, from Sharyl Attkisson, four times, I said he is a hero. But you know, people choose little selective like you try to do. People choose little selective pieces. If you read what I say or if you watch what I say, which is even better, you'll say that there was nothing wrong. But the people that weren't captured are also heroes, Martha.
That wasn't until 1969.
Excuse me.
Have you ever said anything you regret?
Yes, I have, on many occasions.
Can you tell us a few of those? Not the birther issue.
No, I --
Not the immigrant issue.
No, I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't do that, Martha. I wouldn't do that. It's not the appropriate time. But certainly I have said things that I could've held back. But not that often, surprisingly not that often, but certainly there have been occasions.
So let me just get this clear. You are not apologizing. And you are certainly not pulling out of the race as some of your opponents have suggested.
Of course they'd love to have me do that because I'm leading the pack. I'm certainly not pulling out; I'm leading and I'm leading in many states. North Carolina just came in; I'm way in the lead there. Nevada, as I said, just came in. I'm way in the lead there. And, interestingly, in Nevada, I lead in Hispanics by a tremendous -- the Hispanics, I'm way into the 30s with Hispanics. Which I said, if I get the nomination, if I run for president, I will win the Hispanic vote, because I'll be able to take jobs back from China, jobs back from Japan and Mexico, and everybody else that's ripping us off on trade. And everybody knows that. And I will win the Hispanic vote.
Maybe that was unfair. But you yourself and I know you for a long time and I want you to be honest. You do think John McCain is a hero. I know you do.
I do. And by the way, I said it. I actually said it four times and I said it immediately after I went off stage because I was asked that question.
You're right. They are suffering. So how can he be doing --
But he is virtually the head person in Washington. He is the head of the group that runs. I mean, he is -- somebody is doing a bad job. It's corruption. It's massive corruption. It's massive incompetence. And the people are really being treated like third class citizens, Bill. And so he's in charge.
All right. You certainly hit them hard.
You know -- and yet they still like me which is sort of an amazing thing, right?
Well, why would you say the first thing?
But you started it off -- excuse me.
Why would you say --
Hey, Matt. Savannah started it off by saying I said that he wasn't a war hero. I didn't say that. And if you would have let it run just another three seconds, you would have said that I said very clearly he is a war hero. I have absolutely no problem with that. What I do have problems with is that he called 15,000 people that showed up for me to speak in Phoenix, he called them crazies because they want to stop illegal immigration. They were insulted.
Let me --
And they were great Americans.
One little portion --
And John McCain has done nothing about it but talk.
Well, "The New York Daily News" put out your phone number today, but they gave your office phone number, but they didn't give your cell phone.
Well, that's all right. The good news is nobody reads "The New York Daily News." I'm not even sure they had any response to that. Very few people read it. It's a dying newspaper which is good for the public because it deserves to be put to sleep.
So, you think you can turn around -- because a lot of people say, look, that -- those kind of unfavorability ratings; that does not bode well. You think you can turn that around?
I don't know. I mean, who knows? I'm doing this for the good of the country. Somebody has to do it. Politicians are never going to turn this country around. Our country is a mess. The politicians are going to destroy this country. They're weak and they're ineffective. And they're controlled by the lobbyists and the special interests. So, will I? I don't know. I have no idea.
You talk lobbyists and the special interests, though. You and I talked last time. You have given a lot of money to politicians over the years.
Absolutely.
You give to Democrats. You give to Republicans.
I was on the other side.
Aren't you part of the problem?
I was -- absolutely, 100 percent.
You are?
Absolutely. I was on the other side. They would do whatever I want, up until you decide to run.
So, isn't that hypocritical, to say, oh, this is a problem, but I'm going to make the most of this problem?
No. It's called playing the game. I was a businessman. I made a fortune. I made a lot of money. I posted over $10 billion.
So, in order to make money, it's OK to play the game?
Well, it's called your life. I mean, I'm a businessman. And I contribute to people, and they treat me nicely and everything else and --.
Don't you have lobbyists, though?
Absolutely. I have had lobbyists, and I have had some very good ones. They could do anything. They can take a politician and have him jump off this ledge.
Can you jump back and forth, though?
Oh, absolutely. I am able to do that very easily.
That's not hypocritical?
Not at all. Look, I'm going to do -- I have made a lot of money.
I have heard.
And I don't need money. And I don't need money to run. I don't need $5,000 here, $10,000. These guys are desperate for money. I don't need it. I'm going to do what is right for the country.
Who would run your business if you're president?
My children and executives. I have very good executives and great children. They're very good.
Talking yesterday, Jeb Bush said, if we embrace this language of divisiveness and ugliness, we will never win.
Well, when you say divisive, OK.
No, he says --
No, but you're quoting him.
Yes.
But when you quote divisive.
Is it presidential, though?
I think it's presidential.
To give out somebody's phone -- to give out a personal phone number.
Well, that was a long story. I mean, you have to see the whole story the way it morphed. OK? That was a whole story, where he wanted to get on "FOX & Friends, " and he called me up out of the blue. I never met the guy. Then he wanted to come in for campaign contributions. He gave me his -- first off -- and then he starts hitting me years later. And I happen to have this crazy phone number. And I held it up. I said, this guy was over here. And, actually, as you probably know, the room was packed. It was standing room only. In fact, they had theaters. There was overflow crowds. They had all sorts of closed-circuit television into other rooms. The place went wild. We all had a good time.
But is that presidential?
I think so. I think it is fine.
Is that something, as president -- when you're opposed by somebody in Congress, you would give out their personal phone number?
I was hit by somebody unfairly. I was called names by somebody. So, he was up -- somebody that is hitting you, saying what a bad guy I am, was up in my office asking for money and asking if I can get him on television.
So, when -- if you're president of the United States, you are going to be hit by half the country.
That's true. That's true.
Are you going to call them dumb and stupid?
No, I think it's a little bit different. Right now, I'm trying to do something to make the country great again. Politicians will never make this country great again. Now --
As president, you would change your tone?
I think so. I would deal very differently.
Do you have the temperament to be president? That's what -- I mean, that's the question that George -- that Jeb Bush was really raising about the divisiveness, about the language. I mean, the kind of -- like, you take -- you have a no-prisoners approach. Somebody attacks you...
No, I don't have that. I am very different than you would think. Right now, I am fighting because I am number one in the polls by far, and I'm being attacked on all sides. When you're attacked, you have to -- in my opinion --
His brother George W. Bush in -- when he was running, said that he would be a uniter, not a divider. What would you be?
I think I would be a great uniter. We are not united now. We have a president that, whether people love him or hate him, the world is a mess. Hillary Clinton, by the way, was the worst Secretary of State in the history of this country, in my opinion. But we have a president right now --. Excuse me, doesn't get along with Russia, doesn't get along with anybody. I mean, the only one he gets along with is Iran. And even that is sort of very suspect, because they want to blow everybody up.
People --
And I also said, and other groups will take over, that will be worse than Saddam Hussein. You know what happened, Anderson? It's ISIS. They took over the oil.
Have you ever publicly acknowledged making a mistake?
Well, look, everyone makes mistakes. Do I publicly acknowledge making mistakes?
In Iowa --
And, by the way, I was very well received. I had the biggest standing ovation, the biggest standing ovation. And it was really a great day. It was really a great day.
And a lot of people didn't focus on it, because they got caught up in the whole McCain thing. You said at the faith forum, when asked if you have ever asked for forgiveness from God, you said I'm not sure I have. I just go on and try to do a better job from there. I don't think so. And that surprised some people of faith.
Well, I don't think so, you know. And then I said communion. I go to communion. And that's asking forgiveness, you know, in my opinion.
For you, that's asking -- that's what communion is?
Well, it's a form of asking forgiveness, yes, communion. And I go to church a lot. And I'm Protestant. I'm Presbyterian.
So, forgiveness, that notion of forgiveness, that's not a central tenet for you?
Well, I try not to make mistakes where I have to ask for forgiveness, for one thing. So, when I'm asked a question like that, it's like, you know, I don't like to make a lot of mistakes.
So -- and I would never ask the detail, but the idea of repentance, is that something that is important to you?
I think repenting is terrific. I mean, it's great.
But is that -- but do you feel the need to?
If I make a mistake --
Is that part of forgiveness?
If I make a mistake, yes, I think it's great. But I try not to make mistakes. I mean, why do I have to repent? Why do I have to ask for forgiveness if you are not making mistakes? I work hard. I'm an honorable person. I have thousands of people that work for me. I have employed tens of thousands of people over the years.
You give millions to charity.
I give millions. I built the Vietnam Memorial in Lower Manhattan with a small group of people.
At the faith forum, you talked about communion, the Eucharist, Lord's Supper, different -- well, different things. You said that you drink my little wine and have my little cracker.
We were having fun. The room laughed.
I'm just saying. But some people faith there that they --
They didn't say that at all. When I left, I saw people. I got the biggest ovation of the weekend. I saw people. And I saw how a couple of reporters made a big deal out of that. We were having fun. When I said, I drink the wine, I drink -- I eat the cracker, but we're talking about communion.
OK.
And you know what? The whole room was laughing. And they're religious people and they're great people. They're great people. But the whole room was laughing.
Erick Erickson of Red State said that, based on your comments about faith on Saturday, that it is quote "largely closed the book on evangelical support." Do you agree with that?
I don't think so, because I just saw polls in Iowa that I am doing really well. I mean, you know in terms of Iowa, where it's a very big group of people, I'm doing really well.
I started off with the "Washington Post " poll.
You start off with the interview with the poll that I didn't have been they know existed.
No, I started off with the "Washington Post " poll.
You start off the interview with a poll that I didn't even know existed.
No, it's today. It's a Quinnipiac poll.
It's not even a --
OK.
It's on three different states. And you are hitting me with this.
OK.
And I think it's a very -- frankly, I think it is a very fair question.
OK.
I think it is an extremely -- you start off the interview with that. You don't say, I led in the FOX poll. I'm leading in the ABC/Washington Post poll.
You're leading -- you're leading across the board.
Well, you didn't -- I am leading across the board.
Among Republicans, you are way out in front.
Let me tell you, the people don't trust you and the people don't trust the media. And I understand why.
Right, and politicians.
You know, I have always been covered fairly accurately, because it was usually a financial press. And, you know, numbers are numbers, OK? And my numbers happen to be great.
You were also unaffiliated. You were independent.
By the way, I was, and I also live in New York.
The difference I have found between you and just about every other political candidate I have ever talked to is you don't come with a huge retinue, which surprises a lot of people. You talk extemporaneously. Your critics say you don't know the issues enough.
I know the issues better than anybody knows the issues.
You talk extemporaneously. Politicians are very controlled. And I think that's a huge part of your appeal, and I think that's why people enjoy their personal interaction with you. Even right now, we have gone way over the time you said you wanted. Nobody has given me a signal saying wrap it up, he has got to go. So I think that's all to your credit and deserves to be pointed out.
Look, you ask me a question. I give you an answer. It's very simple. I'm a very smart person. You know, I went to the best school. I am a very smart person. All right? Let me just say, so you ask me a question, I give you an answer. I don't need pollsters like Bush and all these other people. They don't answer a question. Hillary, she can't give you an answer without going back and checking it out. I am much richer than almost anybody. I can have thousands of pollsters. I don't have any. I' don't want to waste the money.
Do you think that happens to African-Americans more than it does to you or I?
I hope it doesn't, but it might. I have a great relationship with African-Americans, as you possibly have heard. I just have great respect for them. And they like me. I like them. The answer is, it possibly does, it shouldn't. And it is very sad. If the case is -- I will say, though, in this case, I watched that so closely. I watched it a few times. He was terrible.
Let's now bring in Donald Trump. Donald, I'm reading back this week from "New York Times " and Washington Post articles talking about how your campaign was coming to an end after your McCain quotes. It didn't really feel like the end of a presidential campaign yesterday, did it?
Well, I'm leading in all of the polls by a lot. I was just listening to you, Joe, and you know we all love you and Mika, but I was listening to you talking about Bush and Rubio and a couple of others and you sort of forgot to mention my name even though I'm creaming them all in the polls. I don't understand what you're doing.
Donald, what are you talking about? What are you talking about? We've been talking about you for a week. What are you talking about?
Joe, you were talking about Kasich and you mentioned Bush and Rubio and somebody else that I won't mention because I actually like that person.
What are you talking about? What are you talking about, Donald? How thin is your skin? I've been talking about you for a week.
No, no, I agree with that. But when you were talking about Bush who, by the way, is about ten points lower than me, you sort of mentioned like, you know, can Kasich beat Bush? Well, you know, excuse me, what about Trump? I mean, you know, we are ten points ahead.
Have I mentioned Bush and Rubio this morning, Alex? Alex is our EP.
Having to do with Kasich. Yeah. Having to do with Kasich.
I know what he's talking about. Joe, he was talking about the conversation we had about John Kasich and whether or not he's got the -- Jon Huntsman problem. Then you talked about the other candidates in context with that but you didn't mention Donald Trump, who is at the top of the polls. And he's taking issue with that.
You're forgiven, Joe. And Joe, there is one other little complaint. Hey, Joe. One other little complaint --
Donald, you don't really -- You aren't really that thin-skinned, are you?
Yes, oh, I'm thin-skinned.
Oh, yes, he is.
Oh, yes --
-- that we are ravaged. We are ravaged because everybody said that your campaign was a joke, that you were going to go away. We had one of the top editors in America come on three weeks ago yelling at Mika, being offended and shocked and then, of course, he put you on the cover of the magazine three weeks later, stormed off mad.
That's true.
This is hilarious. You are incredibly thin-skinned, my friend.
I know, I am thin-skinned. Even the fact -- Hey, Joseph? Joseph? Joseph?
Yeah?
Even when you said that polite society, polite society, they treat me so well, you know, it helps when I own Mar-A-Lago in Palm Beach because maybe that's why they treat me well. But that polite society was smiling. They're not smiling. They did smile when I came into Manhattan from Queens. I will say that. But they haven't been smiling for the last 20 years. But that's OK. But polite society has been very polite.
Oh, come on.
No, it's true. You had Katy Tur, and they didn't --
Kasie is great.
They didn't explain what look place there because that was a happening yesterday in Laredo. That was absolutely a happening. And when I got off the plane, there were, you know, tremendous numbers of people. And I will say, Joe, 95 percent of those people were cheering madly in favor. And yet I read and I hear people --
-- what do you do about the -- Of course. I know, Donald. My god! Stop being so thin-skinned!
Yes, Joe.
Who are you hearing that from?
I'm hearing it from other people and I've seen it written in various newspapers. The truth is the government has no idea how many illegals are here. They have no idea. It's a tremendous number of people.
Hey, Donald, good to talk to you --
Hi, Willie.
But Donald, are you --
That is the cover of The New York Times Magazine, which was a great honor, and he was a great, great writer.
Mark Halperin and then Amy Holmes.
I think we're making a great impact and I think we have -- I have a really good chance of getting the nomination. And if I get the nomination, I'm the one that can beat Hillary. She's the worst Secretary of State in the history of our country.
Mr. Trump, good morning.
Hi, Mark.
Huge debate in the Republican Party among the kind of establishment insiders who are terrified of your candidacy about how you're going to be derailed. You're pretty smart about presidential politics. What do you think the most likely way your candidacy could be derailed would be?
Well, you know, you have blowups. I've seen it over the years. It could the -- you know, what I think is a much bigger story than speaking to me today is your whole Hillary criminal probe on the emails. It is a criminal thing what took place. There's no question about it. I think she won't be indicted because it's all Democrats that are the prosecutors right now.
Well, Donald, that's different.
Because you know what? They're seeing what is happening, Joe.
You're saying, Donald, over the last couple of days you say they've been calling and have been treating you better.
Yes, we've had great communication. They are treating me with tremendous respect because they see what I'm doing, Joe. You know, look, I'm No. 1 in the polls. And by far. And the Republican -- the RNC has been very, very nice and respectful.
You know how they held that, Donald? Donald, do you know how they know that you're number -- Do you know how they know that you're No. 1 in the polls? They all watch MORNING JOE every morning and hear us talk about you being No. 1.
Thank you.
-- saying that you are a force to be reckoned with. But I want to ask you about this, that you have said in the past that you probably identify more as a Democrat and you've said that in your view, the economy does better under the Democrats. So I want to ask you, why then are you running as a Republican?
I'll tell you what. First, over the years as a businessman, I've always helped everybody. Helped everybody. Because I'm a businessman. And that's part of the problem with the system. I help everybody. I contribute to people. I -- and when I want something, they are always there for me. They pick up my call, oh, what would you like, and I think most people understand. That's one of the reasons I put in a statement that I'm worth a lot of money. Much, much more money than anybody even thought.
Gene Robinson.
-- are not smart.
Gene Robinson.
And I wouldn't do that.
Donald, after all the swash buckling rhetoric, after all you said about the other Republican candidates, and it's been really entertaining and really effective in many ways, given your standings in the polls, how you could support any of these guys? Because you have really pointed out their deficiencies again and again and again. How could you support them if, you know, for some reason you didn't get the nomination?
Well, first of all, I assume that is Gene Robinson, who I'm starting to love, Joe. You know, I'm starting to love Gene, OK? I'm falling madly in love with him.
OK. Donald --
I hope that won't be the case. I hope that won't be the case. But it could very well be.
But Donald, thank you for being with us.
Thank you. thank you.
Always interesting and good luck. Be safe out on the campaign trail.
Yes, thank you very much.
Right.
And we have a chance to do it.
What exactly are you saying is criminal?
And, frankly, what she did is far worse than what General Petraeus did, and he's gone down in disgrace. I mean, what he did is not as bad as what Hillary Clinton did. And it's similar, but it's not as bad. I mean, she got rid of her server. He never did anything like that.
But, Mr. Trump, what...
And she did it after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress.
So, let me just -- just to clarify, what exactly are you charging that Hillary did is criminal? You're talking about the -- this email news?
I'm talking about the whole email scandal. It's a scandal. I mean, she's been protected. It's been amazing to me how she's been protected. Even the fact that The Times changed their story, I respect the times for going after her like that. But even the fact that they changed the story upon their request, I think they were more right the first time. But whether it was the first time or the second time, what Hillary did is criminal.
Right.
They have budget deficits. He was going to have a lot of big surplus. Well, they have got a $2.2 billion deficit.
So, I hear you. Mr. Trump, I just want to...
So, I think Walker is in big trouble.
OK, but you're not -- but you're not going to rule in or rule out...
I'm going to get rid of the bad ones fast.
OK.
And I'm going to send them back. And we're not going to be putting them in prisons here, and pay for them for the next 40 years.
Right. But there are obviously...
We're going to send them back where they could from.
Right.
And it was documented. You have to be very careful with that.
Let me ask...
So I just see this all happening, and I said it's time to do something about it.
Can you put this to rest once and for all? You're not planning on running third party. You have no intention...
No. Absolutely.
I think the fear is, is that if you didn't win the primary, that you would leave it open as an option. That's what people are wanting to hear you take a stand on that, whether you win or lose, you're going to support the eventual candidate, even though you hope it's you.
If I'm treated fairly and I get a good, fair shot at this and I'm not, you know, being sabotaged with all sorts of nonsense and a lot of phony ads and they throw a lot of money into it -- and you know, they'll do ads that are all false, and you know, this and that -- if I get a good shot, a fair shot, I would have no interest in doing that whatsoever. All I want to do is be treated fairly. And I will say, over the last week or so, Reince and the whole group, they've treated us very fairly.
You know, you -- I was glad to see this weekend -- and you just mentioned in this interview about Hillary Clinton's criminal misconduct. I think a lot of people are looking forward to the time where maybe you're not going after Scott Walker, Jeb Bush or any of the Republican candidates, but her. If it's you versus her...
I am, too!
And she had classified information, we now know.
I mean, if that was General Petraeus, he would have gone to jail for 10 years. What she did is far worse, and they destroyed his life. It's tough stuff.
They'd first have to go back and then...
They go back...
All right, Mr. Trump, always a pleasure. Thank you. Congratulations on your good poll numbers. Appreciate you being with us.
Thank you.
Donald, nice to see you. And thank you for letting me come to is it Trump Tower?
Trump Tower.
All right.
I mean, you can't do better than that. She put out a statement that was false. And actually you shouldn't even be asking a question after reading her statement, but if you want to ask it, it's fine.
Are you surprised, though, that this would come out or do you expect more things that people are going to come at you from all things?
I think it came out many years ago. I mean, I actually think it came out years ago. And, of course, there's a difference now that you are running for president and you're leading in all the polls. So maybe things come out in a much stronger fashion. But I think that was out years ago and it was denied then and it wasn't true. And now I think maybe the denial by Ivana was even stronger now.
So if you were president today, where would you take it from here? What would you do?
Well, I wouldn't have made the deal.
All right, but it looks like there's a good shot that it's going happen and if you become president --
I inherited a bad deal.
Who do you think will get the democratic nomination if you think she won't get it?
I think maybe Biden would get into it. I'm not sure. Bernie Sanders certainly has made an impact. I mean, the two of us, the ones people are talking about. Not that I want to be compared to him, because I don't considered it a very nice comparison to be honest. I think his way off. Although we feel a little similar on trades. It's very interesting. He feels we're getting taken advantage off in trades and on that he's right.
All right, are you preparing for the debate or are you going to wing it?
Well, it's not a question of winging it. I am who I am. I have no pollsters telling me what to say. I mean, I don't have people coming up to me saying do this, do that. I am who I am. It's the real world.
Why the press doesn't like you?
I think they're very dishonest. I mean, I find the financial press to be pretty honest over the years. I find -- and maybe it's easier because it's numbers. I don't know. But I find that the political press is unbelievably dishonest in many cases. I'd say 60 percent of the case. So with the debate, it will be interesting to see even for me. I don't know.
Right. Is it fair to say though that you're looking forward to it?
I do. I look forward to the debate. I think I know what I know. I'm a great jobs producer. Everyone says I'll be the best leader in every poll. I'd be by far the best leader. And by far, economically, I'd be the best.
Donald, always nice to see you. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I want to begin with the latest from Donald Trump. And he joins me now by phone. Mr. Trump, thank you. How are you doing?
I'm doing very well. Thank you very much.
But you're still, I mean, you're not going to fire him or get rid of him?
No, I'm not. He was very angry because they issued a false story to get publicity for themselves and to try to make themselves relevant, which they're not. People have been fired all over the place from that. And others are failing, too, as you know...
Yes.
... in that world. A lot of them are failing. But this one is a particularly bad one. A lot of money was spent on it and it's been a disaster. And he knew that. And he said to them, you know, you're doing the wrong thing.
Yes.
You do this, you're doing the wrong thing. So, what happened is he probably got angry. No. I disagree with it. In fact, when I first saw it, I said, wow, you know, it's something I disagree with. But that's the way it is. He's speaking for himself. He's not speaking for me, obviously. But I did tell him that I disagreed with that.
You're leading by a lot in a lot of polls. And I want to talk to you about that. But to your point, this is to your point, Donald. I don't want you to misconstrue anything. You denounce the statements and give me clarity and then we'll move on.
It's disgusting that they could even make the statements. And, you know, I've denounced it and this isn't new.
I mean the statements from Michael Cohen, you denounce his statement.
Oh, yes, well, I disagree with what he said, absolutely.
Yes. OK. All right. Let's move on because you're talking about how you believe the media texting out of context, will keep who are successful...
Well, purposely.
... from running. And that's part of your appeal. You are the front runner now and I think that's part of your appeal. And so, you know, in the CNN poll, the poll that you just mentioned. But now this debate is coming up. Are you ready for it?
I have absolutely no idea how to answer that question. I am me. I don't have pollsters. I mean, I have a lot of money, much more money than all of them put together and all of their phony contributions put together. But, you have to understand. I want to be me. You know, they pay pollsters millions and millions of dollars, Don. You know that better than anybody.
Yes.
And he should do the job that he's over there for. Not be talking about me.
OK. You say...
You know, I won't be able to build that company.
Yes.
This weekend, I'm going to Tenbury, one of the great resorts of the world in Scotland. I don't like to take time off from what I'm doing because I'm loving what I'm doing. I'm on the trail as you would say, Don.
And then you're back on the campaign trail?
I'll be back on -- I'll be back on Saturday night.
Is the RNC...
I'm leaving tomorrow and I'll be back on Saturday night. I'm leaving tomorrow night and I'll be back on Saturday.
Enough of a silent majority that would give you enough momentum you think to be a viable third party candidate, would you consider that?
Well, you know, a lot of people want me to do that. I have so many people that actually do that.
Yes. And so, do you think that's reflected today in the stocks?
Well, the world is a very shaky place because financially, it's all built on hope and dreams. You look at interest rates being where they are, they are artificially low. You look at what went on in China. And you know, in the case of China, if we have a great leader we can benefit by China collapse. And frankly, I mean, not that it's a nice thing, but we can benefit. If we have a stupid leader, the China collapse is going to take us down with them. So, they better elect Trump or they have a problem.
Donald Trump, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Welcome back to The Savage Nation. I am not a journalist. I'm a talkshow host. I have opinions -- I'm biased. Period. End of story. The rest of them, all are biased. They don't tell you that though. I'm for Trump. Point-blank -- the best choice we have. Donald Trump joins us right now on the Savage nation. Donald, thank you for being with us. What's on your mind today?
It's a great honor. That's an amazing honor for you to say that. It's tremendous. I appreciate it Michael.
But Donald, why should I hide it? I mean people make believe that their not biased. You know and I know the media's biased one way the other. They all pretend that the scientists in a laboratory with a pipette in their mouth. Their all biased. They all have an axe to grind. Look what their doing to you. Smearing you every day with lies Garbage -- pure garbage while they let Obama get away with virtual murder. Give the of the bomb to Iran. Why is the media not saying one word about what Obama is doing to wreck this nation Mr. Trump?
Well he is doing a terrible job. He's been a terrible President. The person that likes him most -- you know I always say is Jimmy Carter because Jimmy's now number two and it's incredible. It's absolutely incredible. And you know, I see Michael, it's been for a long time, I've heard you cannot be every successful person and run for office, especially for president. And I really see it now and people are actually putting things out. Mark Cuban and said it today. He was very nice about what I'm doing -- amazingly nice -- and he said, but it's very hard for somebody that's successfull to run because they go after you to a level and I'm watching...
Right! In other words, if you have a product they could attack your products. These other losers have no products. They've never been in business.
Michael I'm watching people that know nothing about me. Have nothing to do with me. And all of a sudden they're experts on Donald Trump. And they're talking about me like they know something. They don't have anything. Their numbers are wrong. Everything is wrong. It's disgraceful. And at least I have, you know with the Real Donald Trump -- the twitter stuff -- I mean it's... At least I can fight back with the twitter and you can say you don't know me and they never met me and all of this stuff, but I will...
But Donald, I gotta say this, last week I said, here's the secret. The Hispanic people in this country who are legal will vote for Trump because they, of all people, know how hard it is to make a buck and they want a businessman to run the country so they can hold on to what they make. They don't want a socialist stealing their money. And the poll comes out today, and it shows you leading other GOP contenders among Hispanics by a huge margin. It confirms exactly what I suspected. But Donald let's be clear, we know that we have a problem with illegals. We know that that we have illegals voting in this country. We know that to vote in Mexico every eligible Mexican has to have a tamperproof photo ID card with a thumbprint and an embossed hologram. Would you use an executive action to establish strict voter ID laws in the US if you became president?
Well you know something has to be done and I can't believe it when they want to take away cards. They want to take away identification. I assume that means somebody could vote ten times. I mean who the hell's going to know the difference? But you know it's incredible when you look (into this). And you speak of Mexico and I have so many people from Mexico that work for me. They're wonderful people, they're great people. And I respect Mexico as a country. The problem is their leaders are too smart for for our leaders. They're cunning and a very smart and ripping up -- they are ripping off our nation like you've never seen. And very interestingly, if you want to become a citizen of Mexico it's almost impossible. It's so rigorous it's so hard to become a citizen to put you through the grinder. And you just can't do it. And yet in our country -- boom, they walk right over the border and everybody just comes in and has a good time and we pay for them; whether it's prisons or hospitals or anything. I mean in California, I don't know if you saw this story, almost 50% of the people trying to get or applying for drivers licenses are illegals. The whole thing is just insulting.
And so how come Donald Trump, we can't upgrade to Mexican standards without being called racist? Why is it that we can't require voter ID -- tamperproof photo ID cards with a thumbprint as they have in Mexico? Why is it that we can't have the same stringent immigration rules they have in Mexico themselves? You know what happens when a Guatemalan tries to come into Mexico? You know what they do to them. The people in this country have no idea what reality is because of the media and they won't say one word about this. Again, I have to go back -- don't you think it's a good idea to use an executive action to establish strict voter ID in the US? I know I don't want to nail you. I don't want to get you to say yes and then they'll nail you for that. 'So a, Trump goes on right wing Savage show and says, "voter ID law"' and right away they start screaming racism. I get. I know they do. I know the game. So I guess...
You go to a store you need identification to buy something. You have to have identification. And it's incredible to me that people can fight it. You almost wonder where do these people come from? Why are they fighting it and how can we, our side, which is by the way, I think the big silent majority, if you want to know the truth. How can we lose? And I think that's what happened. That's why my poll numbers... We just got numbers and it was just for my desk as I'm talking to you. In Florida, almost 27% for Trump. Jeb Bush is 20. Marko Rubio is 9.7. He's a sitting senator. The other was a governor of Florida. People are tired of it. You know you look at these numbers, like in Florida. And I love Florida. I go there all the time. I haven't made a speech in Florida in years and I'm leading in Florida now, according to this poll and look...
But Donald... wait a minute -- Donald, California is a one-party system, the unions in California put Jerry Brown in office, in my opinion. They have kept the Democrat machine running that state the way that Tammany Hall once ran New York. And I believe the reason we have no voter ID in California and New York and anywhere else is because one party is dependent on voter fraud and that party is the Democrat party. I think something needs to be done. OK so immigration is one big problem but there's another big problem which is our military which has been decimated under Barack Obama. What about the bomb for Iran? What would you do if you became president? What would you do to stop this pathway to a nuclear weapon?
Inconceivable that that deal is being approved and inconceivable that Chuck Schumer who I always thought loved Israel to be honest with you, that he's going to approve it. BecauseIsrael is in such danger now and the whole Middle East. I mean look the place is a total disaster -- What's going on in the Middle East and you look at what's happening and it's incredible that this could happen, but Israel...
Wait, wait -Donald, has Schumer come out and said that he's going to support it?
Well, you know, nobody knows what he's gonna do. I think. Nobody knows. And actually I'm surprised that Israel isn't putting tremendous pressure on Schumer. Because they do have a lot of power over Schumer. And I can't believe that Schumer is taken this stance and nobody, I don't think, anyone really knows. I think most people think he's gonna actually support it. You know the amazing thing about that deal? A couple of amazing things. The 24 day period. What idiot would allow 24 days? And you know the 24 day period doesn't start for a long time because they have to go through a whole process before it starts ticking. So they have a 24 day period but it's a lot longer than that. And the other thing, and it's so simple to understand, our prisoners. Where they say we have four people in there. Let 'em out. Fellas, you gotta let 'em out. And think about it. These people are in prison, and Kerry and Obama said they didn't want to mention the prisoners because they didn't want to complicate the negotiation. You say to yoursef, what's complicated? You say, by the way, it's good for all of us. Let the prisoners out. Yeah, if you have the right messenger, I guarantee you, that those would be gone. They should have been gone at the beginning of the negotiation, not now. It's way late. But they should have been gone right at the beginning. We have four people over there. One's in there because he's a Christian. We have four people in the roughest prison and they've been over there for a long period of time. And we make a deal. And then of course you look at all of the different places where were fighting. They don't want to bring up one thing. It's like one thing has nothing to do with the other. On top of thast we're giving them billions and billions of dollars. I gotta tell you, if Iran was a stock you would buy immediately. And you would make a lot of money.
What Donald Trump is referring to is the fact that Kerry Ketchup has given Iran a handout. In other words, Iran is going to allow, be allowed 24 days before inspectors can access suspected nuclear sites. And what's even worse is yesterday Iran raised the stakes. You know as a negotiator, youwrote "The Art Of The Deal" many years ago Donald, what they did was they got everything they wanted so now they know they have tremendous strength, we have weakness. They raised the stakes yesterday. You know what they said in Iran? I tell you what -- you want a soil sample to see if it has any isotopic activity? We're gonna provide you with the soil. You can't even take it out on your own. What kind of deal is this? In 24 days Iran can hide weaponization activity, centrifuge manufacturing, centrifuge components uranium stockpiles, missile components and other things in 24 days. This is not a deal. This is a sellout, Donald and you know it. And you've been speaking out on it. What's wrong with saying it though.
It's a disgrace. And how he allows this to happen and that we should of done is increased sanctions, doubled them up and these people would've given us everything we wanted. It's such an embarrassment. Our country is so embarrassed by so many things. You know, one of the other things with the Iran deal -- the chief negotiator, he's very smart. You know the Persians have always been great at negotiation. Known great negotiators, the Iranians. What happens is the chief negotiator goes back to Iran and they're dancing and celebrating his big victory in the streets, OK, because it's a total victory. But you know, when you look at Iran, they're going to be wealthy and they're going to be powerful, they're gonna have the nuclear weapons now. And it probably will lead to a whole nuclear all over the Middle East I mean it's probably gonna to be a proliferation all over the Middle East. It is one of the dumbest deals I've ever seen. It's just...
So why did Obama want -- why did Obama pushed it so hard? Why does he need this deal? What is he seeking?
Who can know? You know I said he would look so great if he walked away from the table right now. Now I said that two weeks ago. I said it a month ago. The other thing, did you ever see a deal that took so long to get done? This deal went on forever. And that's called tapping. You know I do that when I have a deal -- I don't know if I want to make it. I might make it. See you tap the people on -- tap, tap, tap. It's called tapping. I guarantee you that during the tapping period, they have been working like hell to put up, you know, to do what they were trying to do, which is pretty obvious to me as far as I'm concerned. But I don't think it even matters because this deal is so bad they can do whatever they want to do. Who's gonna catch them? And don't forget though, and I said before, the 24 days takes a long time just to start the process. You know, to start the clock ticking. So it's a very sad thing. My, it's so sad. So embarrassing -- the whole thing.
Alright. So wait a minute. So we talked about two issues. One is the problem of the surge of illegals, we touched on voter identification, we've touched on the nuclear deal. You're a businessman, your great businessman. Your profitable. The question is you once said run the nation like a business which I agree with and we have talked about putting tariffs on China -- goods from China. Do you still think that's a good idea?
Pecent? Well no. I don't like to do it unless they rip us off and they've been ripping us off for years. We've rebuilt China. If you go to China, you will see bridges bigger than the George Washington bridge being built all over the place. You'll see highways that are so incredible. You'll see -- you'll see airports. Look at our airports, Kennedy and LaGuardia and you look at LAX in Los Angeles and Newark. They're like third world airports. And you go to China, and by the way, other places. You go to Saudi Arabia, you go to Qatar, you go to Dubai, you go to places, you've never seen anything (like these). Michael unless you've been there, you won't even believe what you're seeing. And then you come home and you land at LaGuardia where they have potholes on the runway.
So wait. So you're saying that you don't want donations because you don't want to be beholden to contributers but small contributers don't want anything back, Donald?
Michael one man offered five million. They wanna put millions in. I said don't do it. Because I don't want to be in a position where someday your gonna need any... I want to do what's right. You I have the expression make America great again. I want to make America great again. I can do it. And you know what? If it keeps going the way it's going Michael you never can have that chance again. That's how bad this is.
So you're willing to blow one and a half billion dollars of your own money to become president?
Whoa, I'll be seeing what happens. Number one, I'm doing really well so far. You know in -- up I guess. They say I'm leading in all the polls and we'll see what happens, OK. It's a long long way to go. It's a long...
So we've touched on the monetary aspects. Is there anything else you'd like to give out to the Savage nation? Because I know your time is limited, your on every show in the world. We all love what you're saying. And of course the smearers are smearing around-the-clock while letting Obama get away with virtual murder, giving Iran a nuclear weapon, etc. Anything else you want to leave the audience with perhaps when we come back -- can you hold a few minutes Donald? and close it out with that?
OK I'll hold.
OK. Thank you. I'll be right back. I'm Michael Savage. I'm not a journalist. I'm a talkshow host. I have strong opinions. Donald Trump is with us. Donald, we have very little time. What would you like to leave the audience with today on the Savage nation?
Well, we have to strengthen our military. We have to absolutely take care of our vets. Mike, our vets are treated so badly so horribly. It's ridiculous. And we have to get rid of Obamacare. I mean there's so much to do, so much to do. And we have to do it quickly because we're not going to have much time. If we keep going this way it's not going to be -- you're not going to be able to bring it back. So we have to go... This is a very important election. This is maybe the most important election we've ever had. So, you know...
I hope I hope you're in it for the long haul. Donald, I really hope you're in it for the long haul. As I said at the beginning I'll say it again. Go Donald go. I support your candidacy. No one is gonna get you. I love the purest Donald. The popes of conservativism who so you're not really conservative you not this you're too weak on that. You're almost conservative, you might be... The fact is no one's going to give them 100% of the pure vision they have for the George Washington that never existed. So as far as I'm concerned, you're the standardbearer. You're the only hope we have. You're the lion that we've been waiting for. You're the Winston Churchill of our time and I pray to God that you're in it for the long haul. I ask only one thing in return for supporting you Donald. When you become president, I want to run the NIH and clean it out and put real scientists into it.
That's good. Well, we would We have a smart smart man in charge that's for sure.
My question for you is, people looking at that, they're thinking, OK, if he blows up at a lawyer in a deposition...
I didn't blow up. I didn't blow up.
She is wrong; that didn't happen?
She made it up.
I bought your 2000 book, "The America We Deserve," $7.99 on Amazon, by the way.
Right. Good.
How do you do that, though?
You're going to have -- we are going to have to work out some kind of a very, very smart deal with hospitals around the country.
So, you're in the Oval Office, you're saying, Obamacare...
It's got to go.
It's got to go.
Repeal and replace with something terrific.
Because it would be government assistance, effectively?
It's has to -- you have to help people.
They're illegal, undocumented. You have said that those who are criminals should be thrown out of the country. I think everyone pretty much, you know, would agree with you on that.
No, I don't think so. A lot of people think they should stay here.
Let me just hold on that point right there, because when you say get people out, are you talking like a mass deportation?
We don't even know who these people are.
You're a business guy.
Excuse me. We have got to find them.
But how?
Politicians are not going to find them, because they have no clue. We will find them. We will get them out.
When you say legal, do you mean legal status or can they be eligible for citizenship?
Legal status.
About the Republican National Committee, I know that you have been talking to the chair, Reince Priebus.
I have.
Can you give me some insight into those conversations? Why are you so much more positive now? Is it just because you're the front- runner?
I don't think I have changed. I think that, you know, I have gotten some amazing polls. You look at the poll in New Hampshire or you look at the poll in Iowa...
You can put a lot of money to depend spending. Where is the money going to come from? You know, you say you're going to make friends with the Russia so why you think about the Crimea?
Right, it's going to come from a great economy. It's going to come from just a great economy. Our economy is very weak. We probably have a 21 percent real unemployment rate and I heard somebody that they actually a great economist say it's actually 43 percent unemployment. Now, if you think about it, sounds ridiculous but so many people aren't looking for jobs because.
They don't create jobs, how we're going to create jobs?
We're going to create greatness for our country. We're going to make our country great again in the sense we're going to bring back one of the things. We're going to bring back jobs from China. We're going to bring back jobs from Japan. We're going to bring back jobs from Mexico. We're going bring back jobs from all this.
You need respect right, as a leader?
You need respect. You need respect as a country.
On Russia, you mentioned Russia yesterday, how are you going to make friends with Putin, is that the right way...
No, I don't say make friends, but...
... and work with Putin.
Putin has no respect for President Obama, he will respect me, that I tell you, that he will respect our country.
What do you do with Crimea for example?
Well --
Let's straight to the GOP front- runner, Donald Trump, who joins us by the phone. Sir, thank you for joining us.
Thank you, Jon.
Would President Trump authorize waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation techniques, even torture?
I would be inclined to be very strong. When people are chopping off other people's heads and then we're worried about waterboarding and we can't, because I have no doubt that that works. I have absolutely no doubt.
You'd bring back waterboarding?
... you mention waterboarding, which was such a big subject. I haven't heard that term in a year now, because when you see the other side chopping off heads, waterboarding doesn't sound very severe.
OK. I want to get a sense of what a Trump cabinet looks like, so very quickly, throughout a couple of names: Secretary of State. Who can we see? Who would you consider?
I wouldn't want to put any names out there right now. I think it's far too early. I want to see. And I'm certainly looking at the field. And there are certainly some tremendous people that we could put in, but it would be somebody that's very strong, very smart, and you know what else would be important, very energetic. You need a lot of energy.
Runningmate: Sarah Palin said some very nice things about you, you've said some nice things about her. Will you consider her as a possible runningmate?
Well, I don't think she'd want to, because at the -- the answer is -- you know, I like Sarah Palin a lot. I think Sarah Palin has got the very unfair press. I think the press has treated her very unfairly. But I would pick somebody that would be a terrific -- you know, you have to view it as really who would be a good president in case something happened. But I would -- there are many, many people out there that I think would be very good.
OK. Donald Trump, thank you for joining us.
Thank you very much.
So you don't think Biden could beat Hillary?
I think that Biden would have a good chance of beating her now. I don't think he could have beaten her six months ago or even three months ago. I think the email scandal is going to be a devastating blow for Hillary, if you have an honorable prosecutor, which we will see whether or not that happens, because they are all Democrats. But if there is an honorable prosecution, that would mean that she is in big trouble, because, again, you look at General Petraeus, a wonderful man, they destroyed him. He was destroyed over something far less and similar, but far less than what she has done. So I think she has got some very big problems. And you look at her poll numbers, they are coming down. They are coming down like a crashing rocket.
All right, Donald Trump, we appreciate your time. We will look forward to talking to you again.
Thank you very much, John. Great honor.
I'm joined now on the phone from New York by the man that has shaken up the Republican race: Donald Trump himself. Mister Trump, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS.
Good morning, Chuck.
So in June right before you announced, you were at one percent. In July after you've announced, in the last six weeks, you're in first place with 19 percent. Why do you think you're resonating so quickly in the Republican field?
Well, I think a lot of people did not believe I was going to be running, Chuck. And they thought it was -- you know, they didn't want to waste poll, though, so to speak, and they really felt that I wouldn't run. I mean, I have a -- a wonderful life. I have a wonderful -- I built a tremendous company. And, you know, a lot of good things going on. And they said, why would he give that up to go into this fray? And once I announced, as you probably know better than anybody, my poll numbers started to shoot up like a rocket ship and they continue to go up. And a couple of polls came out recently where I'm number one with Hispanics, as an example in Nevada.
OK.
And North Carolina was very strong. Nevada was very strong overall, too. It was number one place in both cases. I mean, it's been -- it's been terrific.
Now there is a -- look, there's -- with the good, there is bad. You also have the highest unfavorable rating of any of the candidates we tested. And a majority of folks we asked say you're doing more to hurt the Republican Party than help. Why do you believe there is this sort of polarizing view of you?
Well, I don't think they understand my message or maybe they haven't heard my message yet. But I noticed that in certain states like North Carolina, we have a very strong favorability rating and others -- and other places, including New Hampshire, including Iowa, there's a very strong favorability rating. And I noticed that as I get to areas -- I've been in Iowa a lot, I've been in New Hampshire a lot, I've been in South Carolina a lot. And where I go and where I speak, they really change those numbers very quickly.
Let's talk about the debate.
OK.
And let me ask you this way. I know one of the things you did that surprised me is, you downplayed your expectations. Mister Trump, with all due respect, you never downplay your ability on anything. Why did you downplay your expectations on debating?
Well, I'm not a debater. I don't -- I've never debated before. I've never been on a stage debating. I guess my whole life has been a debate in one way. But I've never been on a formal stage debating. So I really don't know. I understand you have nine other people that are going to be shooting at me, and that may be true or maybe not. But I -- I really don't know. I -- I don't have pollsters, I don't want to waste money on pollsters. Because, you know, they -- I don't want to be unreal. I want to be me. I have to be me. You know? We have enough of that in Washington with pollsters telling everybody what to say and everybody being controlled by the special interests, and -- and the lobbyists, etcetera, etcetera. And the donors. I see the donors all over the place. I know them. And I know they don't give because they happen to be nice people. So I think that really -- you know, who knows? I -- I certainly -- I think I know most of the subjects very well. I've been through it. A lot of people have been asking me a lot of questions for three or four months. And -- and we'll what happens. But again, I don't think you can artificially prepare for something like this.
You've been compared to a rattlesnake by Marco Rubio's campaign, a drunk NASCAR driver, I think by the Kasich campaign. Let me ask you this, how would you advise a candidate to debate you on stage?
Well, I think I'm a nice person. I -- I really do. And I think that's why my numbers always go up as they get to know me better. I think that, frankly, I'd like to discuss the issues. I'm not looking to take anybody out or be nasty to anybody. And as you know, Chuck, you know, when I made -- you know, harsh statements about various people, that was always in response to their criticism of me. You know, Rick Perry, I always thought he was a nice guy, but he started hitting me hard, so I hit him harder. And I'm not, you know, looking -- I don't know what they're going to be doing. I'm reading so many, you know...
So if they don't attack you, you're not going to attack them?
I think it's highly unlikely. I really do.
But if they attack you?
I -- I've always counterpunched. And you have to --
Yeah.
... counterpunch. But I'm not looking to start anything, that's for sure. I'd rather discuss the issues. Our country is in serious trouble, and we have a lot of problems in every front. And I'd rather discuss that. But, you know, I -- I read people and I listen to you and others, and a lot of people say or they're getting ready and they've got their little lines given to them by the pollsters. You know, everything's perfectly put down by a pollster, what to say and how to attack me. And, you know, if that comes, it comes, and I have to handle it at the time.
Now, I know -- I'm hoping that you and I are going to sit down face-to-face soon and go in detail on policy issues. But I want to ask you about a -- a story in this morning's Washington Post. And it says, Republican candidate Donald Trump's platform: Because I Said So. And there is some growing criticism that says, when are we going to see the details? When are we going to see your policy proposals? I know your campaign says you have them. There's a tax plan on the shelf ready to roll out. An education plan on the shelf ready to roll out. When is the public going to see this, sir?
Well, it's all true and we do have a lot of different policy programs and I think they're going to be -- I don't know, popular. But they're going to be something that's going to set the country back right. I mean one of the big things is we have to take back jobs from China, we have to take back jobs from Japan and Vietnam and Mexico and virtually everybody that's taking our jobs and ruining our manufacturing base. And we have to put people to work, Chuck, because the real number is probably 21 percent. The real unemployment number is probably 21 percent. People give up looking for jobs, and they no longer become a statistic. And it's very unfair. So we have to put our country back to work. We have to get great jobs for people, and good paying jobs for people. And we're going to be just fine.
All right. Very quickly, two more questions. One, the news about Joe Biden, thinking about challenging Hillary Clinton, who would you rather face, Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden?
Well, I -- I don't have a choice. I would say this. I think with what she is doing and how she's coming out, she has, you know, she's got a terrible record. She's probably the worst Secretary of State in the history of this country. And she's now, you know, the email thing, I mean -- what they did with Petraeus is they destroyed his life. What she did is far greater and far worse than Petraeus did. So I would think that she at some point, you're going to get a prosecutor who's going to be an honorable prosecutor, and there's going to be major problems for her. So I would think other people would be looking.
So you don't have much to say about Joe Biden, it sounds like? You were a donor to him -- you've given him money in the past?
I -- I think he's -- I think he's fine. I mean I think he's fine, if he runs, he runs. I mean you have to worry about -- I like to do things nice and systematically. Right now I have -- I guess you could say 16, because somebody else just joined. So I have 16 opponents and I'd like to focus on them and then I'll focus on Hillary. And I actually think Hillary will be easy if it's her. But I'm not so sure it's going to be her.
And -- and again, I know we're going to get into a lot more issues with you in a couple of weeks. But I want to ask you about Black Lives Matter. The latest shooting of a -- a white police officer shooting an unarmed black man. Do you see this as a crisis in America?
It's a massive crisis. It's a double-crisis. So what's happening -- and -- and people, you know, I -- I look at things and I see it on television and some horrible mistakes are made. At the same time, we have to give power back to the police, because crime is rampant. And I'm a big person that believes in very big -- you know, you -- we need police, and we need protection. Look, I look at some of the cities, you look at Baltimore, you look at so many different place in this country, Chicago, certain areas of Chicago...
Yeah.
... they need strong police protection. And those police can do the job, but their jobs are being taken away from them. At the same time, you've got these other problems, and there's no question about it, they are problems. There's turmoil in our country.
Do you understand why African-Americans don't trust the police right now?
Well, I can certainly see it when I see what's going on. But at the same time, we have to give power back to the police, because we have to have law and order. Hundreds of -- of killings are in Baltimore, hundreds of killings are in Chicago, and New York is not doing so great in terms of that front and so many other cities. We have to give strength and power back to the police. And you're always going to have mistakes made and you're always going to have bad apples. But you can't let that stop the fact that police have to regain some control of this tremendous crime wave and killing wave that's happening in this country.
All right. Well, all eyes are going to be on you for the next four days. And of course, in prime time on Thursday night, Mister Trump, I look forward to having a -- a deep dive on policy and issues with you in a couple of weeks, I hope.
Good. I do, too. Thank you very much, Chuck.
Morning Glory and Evening grace America. It's Hugh Hewitt. It is the week that the campaign officially begins so I begin with the biggest interview you can have this week, the biggest name on the stage, the highest polling person in America, Donald Trump. Just back from Great Britain, Donald Trump, welcome back to the Hugh Hewitt Show.
Hello Hugh.
I did not know that you owned Turnberry.
I do. I own it and I have no mortgage on it -- that's even better and it's a great place. It's one of the great resorts of the world as you know.
Well, I'm a little bit hurt. You've done some good interviews with me and you've never invited me to play Turnberry.
Anytime you want.
Alright.
I was over there because we have the Woman's British Open which is a major and a really big tournament and it was fantastic.
And a dramatic last round. Now, can I get you to buy the Cleveland Indians? Can we get you to turn around the Indians?
Well, I'll tell you what that's a great franchise. There is no question about it, that's true but I don't know -- and is is a favorite and a great franchise.
You've never wanted to own a sports team have you?
Never much. I mean I looked at them over the years and I sort of came to the realization that you tend to make money when you sell the team. You don't make money when you own it and the players and making more and more so it's a little bit tough but yeah, the NFL teams do pretty well but it's not an easy business.
Yeah, but if you want to win Ohio in the general you definitely want to own the Indians.
I'm not buying.
When you were gone I was on Hannity and I proposed that you are the only candidate now in the race or actually in the last few races about a major musical would be made. Has anyone ever approached you about Trump the Musical?
They actually have not for the race but about 2 years ago they wanted to do it on Broadway and they are still talking about it. The it was going to be called 'Trump, the Musical". How do you know this?
Well...
It was very big, big people on Broadway that have wanted to do that for a couple of years actually. Nothing to do with politics. This was before the politics.
I'm not surprised.
Maybe it does better now.
Well, I bought the domain names. I'll sell to you for 3 million dollars.
You have a deal. That's sounds great.
Now, let's get serious. I will talk first about this nonsense about a third party. I know you don't need any advice but I'm gong to give you some. You will do better in the Republican primaries if you just swear off the third party because a lot of Republicans will never vote for someone who like Ross Perot will hand the election to a Democrat.
Well you know Hugh, it's a very interesting subject frankly the third party. Number 1, leading the Monument Poll just came out and the that was a big, big victory but I will say that I only want to run as a Republican and they've been treating me well the last couple of weeks but as you know we had a lot of difficulty a couple of months before that and with let's call it the establishment it just seems to me that as long as we are treated with respect, and treated fairly as a Republican I want to do that. I want to run as a Republican because that is the way we are going to win. We are going to beat -- I don't know if it's going to be Hillary because to honest the problems she's got with the email stuff -- I mean I don't know how she can run. Because Petraeus as you know was just destroyed over the same thing except his is a much, much more minor infraction and what she has done is criminal so I just don't know if she is running or not. But I believe that I would absolutely beat her and or Biden or whoever is gong to run because the country is ready for such a change. When it comes to that I would say that I want to keep my options open but I could certainly maybe be convinced at a certain point.... I'm doing
Yeah, because I think...you're putting a ceiling.
Very well with the folks and we will see what happens, but it is something that I could be convinced. There is no question about that.
Well my two sense is that you put a ceiling on yourself because a lot of people like me will never support anyone who dangles the opportunity of third party because it means the other side wins.
I've never heard it put so strongly because you know I want to run as a Republican. That's what I want to do. That's what I'm doing. I'm not even thinking about the other and people I'm immediately going to give that up and it's just something that it doesn't seem to give it up but when you said it the way you said it, that's very interesting so I'll be thinking about that.
Now I want to go back to Hillary cause you just something that is true. 18 USC 1924 makes it a crime that David Petraeus plead guilty to 2 years of probation, a $100,000 fine before Mr. Deutsch lost his job in the government.. When I was in the government handling top secret SCI information -- if I had left it on my desk much less take it home, much less left the government and kept it, I would have gone to jail. You said what she has done is criminal. Do you think people widely recognize that Donald Trump?
I think it is amazingly... You talk about Teflon and they have been skirting the law for years in so many different elements but it is amazing that she's getting away with it and they talk like she's going to be running, she's going to be the candidate. I was watching some of the pundits the other day, even the Republicans, even the conservative guys they are talking like it's going to be Hillary and they don't speak of it like I speak of it. I'm very surprised that they are not tougher with what she did with emails because it is really a criminal act. You know, she got a subpoena from the United States Congress and after she got the subpoena she deleted a lot of the emails. I mean that was a combination. So, what she has done is incredible and it is incredible to me that they are talking about her as the candidate so routinely and you see that. You know they talk about Hillary, Hillary as a candidate but what she did I think was illegal.
Alright now let me talk to you about the other big story that happened to you when you were in Great Britain the Planed Parenthood videos. Have you watched them, Donald Trump?
I have. I thik it was disgraceful. I have watched them, yes.
And so should the Republicans shut own the government rather then fund Planed Parenthood?
Well, I don't know what's going to happen? I guess they are doing it right now as we speak. I'm in my office in New York and I guess as we speak they are going for a vote of some kind and you would think that that would be a vote that they is the word that the won't...
The word is that the Democrats will filibuster and the president will veto -- that's the only way to get rid of Planned Parenthood money for selling off baby parts is to shut the government down in September. Would you support that?
Well I can tell you this. I would and I was also in support if the Republicans stuck together you could have done it with Obamacare also, but the Republicans decided not to stick together and they left a few people out there like Ted Cruz. You know, they left a lot of the people who really went in and wanted to do the job and you know what? If they had stuck together they would have won that battle. I think you have to in this case also, yes.
Now, I want to go and talk to you about John McCain. I've had my arguments with John McCain over the years and a lot of them actually. I've always said he's a great America, a lousy Senator, and a terrible Republican but he was a man of great courage. You've said you don't like people who get taken captive. Do you regret that? I mean can we admit that was a mistake?
Hugh, I actually said and when they took the whole statement under it worked fine but where I'm upset with John McCain and happened for a long time, I've been making the rounds to many states and you see that I'm all over the place and the Veterans come up to see me about -- some of these guys are just strong powerful, wonderful people and the families are wonderful and they come up to me and they have tears coming down their eyes because of the way they are treated. And, John McCain has nothing, nothing for the Veterans, In addition, when I was in Arizona I had 15,000 people that were there -- you heard about it --
A big rally. Big rally.
With phenomenal people and John McCain called them crazies and that -- and these people were phenomenal Americans and he called them crazies so I have no problem with what you said except that he's got to be a little bit careful. You can't call those people crazies and you got to have the Veterans and he -- it just hasn't worked for the Veterans.
But will you agree with me that people who have been captured in war are often captured because they are too courageous and jet pilots over North Vietnam, that's courage.
Oh, absolutely. I said that. I've actually said it. You know you had a very, a very good reporter as you know -- you've heard all about that analyze what I've said and came out and Atkinson had said what I said was right but they had to read it and they take a quarter or a half sentence out but certainly it's courage. I have no question about that. While disappointed with McCain he has not taken care of the Veterans and the Veterans are treated very badly in our country and that's terrible.
Alright Now I want to get back to the Republicans. If you are treated well but you don't win anyway -- let's just say it's a fair fight, you are not going to run a third party, you declare as much, can we talk to you already about running against the DeBlasio because you could be the DeBlasio like a pancake, right? And you know how to run...
He certainly has a lot of problems New York I will say that and lot of people are very unhappy so we'll see what's going on. I certainly would have no interest in doing that, but he does have a lot of problems in New York and the people in New York are very upset with him.
Why would you have interest in being the Mayor of New York?. You are a big guy. It's takes -- it takes Rudy, it takes, LaGuardia, it takes Jimmy Walker -- it takes big people to run that state.
Rudy actually did a very good job. Rudy was a very good mayor. He did a good job. Especially when it came to the crime aspect of it and he was terrific. I am so set on making America grow gain and I know how to do it and I will make such incredible trade deals. You know we are losing with everything, Hugh. We are losing with China, we are losing with Vietnam -- people don't know what's going on with Vietnam. We are losing in trade and the border with Mexico. I mean everybody beats us. You know Saudi Arabia makes a billion dollars a day and they give us nothing and we protect them. You know with out us they wouldn't be there for fifteen minutes frankly. And you know just see what's going on and I can't believe the stupid. You look at the Iran deal -- I mean tell me about the Iran deal with the 24 days and with the four prisoners that we can't even get because they don't want to bring it up because it's too complicated, and why is it complicated? And you know we gave them back a nuclear scientist, people don't event realize that. We gave them back one of their scientists a nuclear scientist and yet we can't talk about these four people that are in prison for no reason whatsoever. One is in prison because he is a Christian -- he's a Christian pastor. So, you know I look at what is going on with the country, I look at Sergeant Bergdahl which is terrible. I mean he's a traitor so we get Bergdahl and they get five people that they most wanted anywhere in the world they get them and now those people are back on the battle field and we have Bergdahl. Who the hell wants him?
Alright. Question:
I can't believe what goes on with our government.
Edward Snowden, hero or traitor?
Oh, I say total traitor. I think he's disgusting and I think he's a traitor and I think it is amazing that Russia is keeping him and it just shows that the stand that the Russia has for Obama. I say total traitor.
So did Hillary. I mean, those governments knew everything that was on Hillary's server.
I agree with that. And you know who also knew? Huma Abedin. And you know who her husband is? One of the sleaziest guys in the world, Anthony Weiner. Now, you don't think she told him about all of these emails that she had Huma was the one who had a process. She had everything and of all people she is married to Anthony Weiner and he now works for a PR firm. So think of this -- he's a PR guy working for a PR firm, he's a total sleaze and she is giving all this information and this is top secret stuff but she is the one that processed it.
There are concerns about Huma and by Andrew McCarthy -- I put them in my book The Queen -- she has a very sketchy background going to back to Muslim student association and other sketchy -- do you share those concerns?
Well, I certainly think there is a lot of things going wrong with Huma and that from my standpoint because I knew Weiner and Weiner is not a good guy and for his wife -- and you know -- a husband and wife they talk, it's called natural. They talk and for his wife to have access to these emails and give them to Anthony Weiner and what he did -- forget about the internet what he did, he now works for a public relations firm.
Now let me ask you about the American nuclear triad.. Is it necessary anymore, Donald Trump, is it affordable?
I think one of the most important things that we have to worry about is nuclear generally speaking. The power of nuclear, the power of the weapons that we have today and that is by the way -- the deal with Iran -- the concept of it is so important that you have to make a good deal and what they should have done is that they should have doubled up and tripled up the sanctions and negotiate from strength instead of the pathetic negotiators that we had so anything that we had to do with nuclear to me the power of the weapons -- the problem is that it is not how many soldiers you have, the power of weaponry today is is utmost important.
Do we need all the three kind of nuclear weapons that we have though?
I think we should have absolutely have -- you know we are going to have to build ourselves back up because -- I don't know if you saw that 60 Minute piece about a year ago where our nuclear weapons are so absolute and so outdated, the phones didn't work, the wires were rotted and frankly to allow that to actually go on television where they are giving tours of places of silos and they are rusting and rotting and I'm Putin and I looking at that I'm saying I'm saying, "Wow these guys don't have the power we thought they had."
But do you think we can afford to to just update one of the three legs nor do we need all three of them like the Cold War?
I think we need massive protection and unfortunately you know the nuclear is the protection It's not just the question of having a million soldiers nowadays. You need the protection because North Korea has it, the deal based on everything that I've seen as you know Iran is gong to have it, Pakistan has it, India has it. Hopefully, India is on our side a little more than most but people are getting it and Russia has it big league and China has it, but you know, Putin said about a month ago and I was shocked to hear it -- first time I've ever heard it from that kind of a power. Essentially he said don't mess with us, we have nuclear weapons. Do you remember that?
Yep.
Why would somebody say that from that kind of country?
We are out of time so I just got to close with a couple of pop culture. Have you picked a campaign sign yet like Frozen or you could do Let it Go that would be a good one for you.
Well, basically We are Not Going to Take it Anymore which is pretty good and it's pretty good because that's what it is. We can't take it anymore.
I wouldn't use that though. Arnold used that though and Arnold had a glass jaw, Donald Trump.
I didn't know he used that, well I'll have think about that. My theme is make America great again. The theme is very important.
I love your helicopter gig coming up in Iowa that's a terrific idea.
Well, we are going to try and get the kids on there and giving them a little fun.
Yea, make sure the helicopter is working. Last question. When is the last concert you went to Donald Trump?
Well I haven't had much time -- probably Elton John at Madison Square Garden.
OK so you do go to concerts are you a pop culture aficionado?
A little, not an aficionado but I do I like music.
OK. Last thing I'm leaving you with I'm waiting for the Turnberry invite and number two about Indians.
One hundred percent on both. I love the idea of the Indians I have to tell you and Turnberry as you know is a very special place
Are you ready to do that?
So simple. I'm totally ready to do that. You know, the great wall of China built a long time ago is 13,000 miles. I mean you are talking about big stuff. We're talking about peanuts by comparison to that. Mexico will pay for the wall. I will make sure it gets done properly.
All right. You have said that before but you're still not telling me how you are going to make Nieto pay for the wall, how?
Bill -- Bill, it's simple. They are taking in billions and billions of dollars. They are building the Ford Company -- Ford Motor Company is building a $2.5 billion.
If you would repeal NAFTA by executive order as president that would certainly hurt Mexico. So maybe you could do that. By the way, do you know why they built the great wall of China who they wanted to keep out?
Lots of people that they didn't want.
No, no, no. The Mongol hoards. That might come up tomorrow. You credit me for giving you that answer if you use the great wall.
Ok. Good. I will remember that.
But do you plan on singling out Bush or Walker or any of the others -- do you plan on singling them out?
I'm not looking to do that. I'm not looking to hurt anybody. I'm not looking to embarrass anybody. If I have to bring up deficiencies I will bring up deficiencies. But certainly I'm not looking to do that.
Ok.
I would rather go straight down the middle but you don't know what's going to happen.
I can assume that you are not going to launch the first grenade but if they come after you, you will go back at them?
I think you can assume that yes.
Ok. Because Rand Paul almost has to go after you. I mean because his campaign, he has got to get attention. Chris Christie and you -- you're friends with Governor Christie, right? So I don't expect that to happen.
Well, you don't know. But yes, I am.
But Rand Paul he may -- he may throw a few.
We will see what happens.
Ok. Now, are you nervous? Do you get nervous? I mean, you know, it's a big deal, 48 hours, this is probably the biggest thing in your life. I mean, you can tell Geraldo that he is a pinhead on your other show that you are not doing anymore, but that's nothing compared to this worldwide debate. Are you nervous?
Well, I mean, the biggest thing in my life is my family and my children in all fairness -- Bill. This is a different kind of a thing.
Ok. But I'm now talking professional. Right.
This is a different kind of a thing. This is a big league deal. There is no question about it. Everybody is talking about it. I'm getting calls from the biggest people in the world. They are watching. They are watching.
Well, you are on the biggest show in the world right now. Come on. You know where you are.
Well, I'm on a great show.
You are not going to have any trouble with that. You are -- you will have answers and I know you will. But you know what? I think you are surprised at your poll numbers. I think you are surprised that you are the frontrunner right now and all eyes are on you in this debate. I think that's taken you aback.
Well, the poll numbers are not only good. I mean, they are phenomenal. We just got numbers from South Carolina, which are through the roof, Iowa, New Hampshire, not only the national numbers. So I'm very honored by it but what it really shows is the people are tired of incompetence. They don't want incompetent politicians running our country. They don't want the Iran deal where they get 24 days and it's really not 24. It's much more than that, 24 days plus a period of time before that to look and go and check. They don't want prisoners left over there. We signed a deal. People are tired of incompetent politicians.
All right.
You watch. I will prove you wrong.
Donald Trump is with us. Donald, I know you don't like talking about yourself but we're talking about you for you. There have been a spate of new polls out this morning. I know you don't look at polls. But they all have you doubling the field. The state polls are even more impressive. New Hampshire, South Carolina, you're blowing the field away. What -- what's -- what do you do, Donald, going into the debate? Do you play it safe now that you're in first place by a comfortable margin?
Well, we're doing really well if Iowa, too. I don't know if you've seen that poll so I'm very happy about that.
Oh Lord.
A great poll. And it just -- I guess it just came out or it came out recently, but I was told we are doing very, very, well in Iowa.
Yep.
So, that's good.
All right.
You don't have to worry about Congress or anything else. But we have to have great trade deals. Mexico, as an example, is killing us on the border. And I have a great relationship with Mexico. They buy my apartments, I have thousands of people over the years --
Right, right.
-- have worked for me. But we have to make great trade deals. Because we have to make our country rich again. We can't let all these other nations steal our jobs. They're stealing our manufacturing.
Donald, we've got a lot of people around the table who want to talk to you.
OK.
Donald, Willie Geist, good morning.
Hi, Willie.
Good to talk to you.
Thank you.
One of the biggest issues in this campaign right now on the Republican side is Obamacare.
Right.
But instead, there is only one person you are bidding against, so of course the health care costs, Mike Barnicle, are sky high.
Joe, I can't bid against anybody. There's like one group that comes in all the time. I say get me more, get me more. And they're not allowed. If I want to go to New Jersey, or if I'm in New Jersey and I want New York, I can't bid anybody. I get one or two people, one or two groups, and they're not even good groups. And they give lousy service, lousy treatment. And the reason that is is because they make a fortune. Because they have the politicians taken care of with their lobbyists and the special interests and the donors.
So -- so --
And one of the things they like --
Agree.
And I say for those people, maybe you're talking about 25 percent, 20-something percent. For those people, I'd work out deals with hospitals. Which, by the way, are not doing well. Hospitals are not doing well.
He's absolutely correct.
Hey, Mike -- Mike, the insurance companies are making a fortune because they have special interest, where Obama does whatever they want them to do. That's what happened with Obamacare.
Mr. Trump, good morning.
Yes.
I think it's fascinating, you talk about the outsiders. Outsiders -- it's very interesting that somebody that's been as successful as Donald Trump is still viewed as an outsider. He's viewed as an outsider in Washington and I love the story they began with, Willie, talking about he's a Brooklyn guy and a Queens guy, who told his dad he wanted to go into Manhattan and build big buildings. And there's a pushback; there is a Manhattan pushback. There's just -- it's always -- but you know what? That happens all the time.
Joe, Willie's father, the great William Geist, wrote that story, the cover of The New York Times Sunday Magazine.
It's true, that is a true story.
OK, and he actually wrote that story, many years ago, I don't know what that was.
So he did not have bad breath, actually.
So it's one of those -- he didn't have bad breath actually.
OK.
Because I create jobs and they want jobs. They don't want jobs from China, taking away from China. And all of these countries that are taking our jobs, they are ripping our country to the shreds. And with me, that will not happen.
Good luck out there. Good luck on Friday.
Thank you very much.
You said you liked Paul Volcker. And do you like the rule named after him as part of Dodd-Frank, the Volcker Rule?
Well I'm not sure if he likes it, but if he's -- you know what, honestly, Mark, if he's happy, I'm happy. He was a terrific guy. I've met him a few times. And I thought he was terrific. But I think his policy and his demeanor -- there was something very solid about him. His demeanor were very good.
Mr. Trump, we're going to spend the last couple of minutes with you talking about stuff that's not really about politics, just a couple questions so that we can help our viewers get to know you as a person a little better. One of my fundamental forks in the road of life is the question of whether you're a Beatles person or a Stones person. Are you a Beatles person or a Stones person?
I really like them both, but I'll guess I'll go with the Beatles.
I know you like to golf. I know you like to spend time with your family. What else do you like to do these days for fun?
Well I guess a lot of fun is talking to you guys, but I don't have a lot of time left. I just got back from Scotland, because I own Turnberry, one of the great resorts of the world. And we had the Women's British Open there, which is their biggest tournament that I had to be there for two days. So I didn't even get to stay for the final day because I was actually anxious to get back on the so-called trail.
Are you saying that now between your work, your business, campaigning, family and golf you don't have time for anything else fun?
I would say pretty much I'm maxed out.
Wow.
There's no question about it. My life is an interesting life, but I would say I'm maxed out.
Based on the tweets it seems like you sleep four hours a night? Is that right?
I'd say that. I'd say four, yes.
Do you nap -- do you ever nap?
No, I don't nap. I don't nap.
Are you tired?
And again I -- well if -- no, I don't think so. And if I am --
It would be an incredible benefit compared to some of the people you're running against. You're up 20 hours a day. That's pretty good.
Well I always say to people -- I mean I have some friends that don't sleep very much. And I always say, assuming you don't need it, I always say to them that we have a big advantage because we have more hours in the day to work and compete. So it is a definite advantage.
All right. Mr. Trump, I want to commend the idea to you of trying out the idea of power naps. I think those would be -- you'd helpful -- you'd get a lot out of those. Donald Trump, thank you for coming on the show.
Thank you both very much. Thank you very much.
I appreciate it, Donald Trump. I tell you what, I think you're the man for this country. And I hope and pray I know you'll do what you said because I've got confidence in you. And they ought to get rid of Obama longtime ago because he never done nothing.
Well, that -- you have no complaints, you have many people out there that agree. I mean, it's been a very bad period of time with his leadership. There's no question about it, Beada.
You sound like you're managing expectations.
Yeah.
You are setting the bar low and, you know, we can all this deprive.
I am. I want to set this as low as possible. I want to set that bar so low. I want to set that bar so low you have no idea. But the, you know, we'll see what happens.
You also heard Beada mention taxes.
Yeah.
Beada, it's wonderful to have you here. And before I let Donald Trump go let me just ask you, is there anyone in particular that you're concerned about, that you're worried about, or that you consider really your most formidable opponent there on stage?
I don't think so. I think they're all very smart. As I've told you, I respect many of them. Many of them I've been a contributor to campaigns over the years. I mean, I've contributed a lot of money to a lot of the people that I'm up on stage with. And they probably, I can say without question, they treat me much better when I was in that position than the position I'm in right now.
Oh I'm sure that that's one of the criticisms of you of course.
Yeah that's one of the problems.
They criticized that you've given the Democrats as well and you might get some of this tomorrow night.
Oh no, that's OK but then I do. I give every -- and I'm a businessman and when I go and when I need something that even if it's two or three years later, they're always there for me. And that's part of the problem that we have with this country and the system.
Thank you, Donald Trump.
Thank you, Beada.
It absolutely is. Thank you very much. We appreciate you being here Donald Trump.
Thank you, Trish.
First time in any situation like this. How did you feel up there?
Well, it was exciting. So many people. Everybody is going wild and I believe in my subject matter, I mean, make America great again. And that word again is a very important word, because it can happen, but you need the right leader. So hopefully we continue to do well.
What really made you popular, you're not afraid to just say...
I'm not afraid.
But you hoped -- if you didn't win, you would hope that you would be able to support the Republican nomination.
One hundred percent correct. I just want to be treated well, be treated with respect. 100 percent correct.
OK, let me ask you, before you ever became a candidate, you're outspoken. You had a Twitter war with Rosie O'Donnell.
And many others.
You know, I interpreted your, the comments you made about Mexican immigrants, I think differently than other people did, when you talked about the Mexican government -- and that came up again and again tonight.
Yes. Well, you interpreted it correct.
I interpreted is that they're not doing anything to stop it and it actually is a stop-gap for them if they allow people to leave at will. Is that what you were saying?
And they save a lot of money.
A fortune.
They don't have to take care of the people. We're not getting their best and their finest. They're pushing people out. And I'm talking about serious, in many cases, people that would be in their prisons, they say, hey, let the Americans. The Americans have stupid leaders. Let them put them in their prisons. And the problem is, you have people like the guy -- the absolute bad guy who killed Kate, and killed Jamil and killed other people.
All these people.
You know, you have all these people coming in and they're killing, and causing crime and the drugs are pouring in. So, I turned out to be right. I took tremendous heat that first day. A lot of your friends like Rush Limbaugh and a lot of people, they said boy, they used the word incoming. But Trump is taking tremendous incoming. It was an honor, and now some of the people that you would least expect it are calling me up and apologizing. What I am is true. The word illegal immigration would not have been a topic if it wasn't for me.
It is a truth, though, people donate for the purpose of influence. Maybe the difference is you're honest about it.
When I see the candidates -- and I like these candidates, I had a great relationship with them tonight, as you can see, for the most part.
You got -- you gave a very forceful answer about all the hundreds of businesses, I guess, the corporations that you have. That you use the laws of the land.
I use the laws of the land.
Which kind of goes -- I was a little surprised. You've been pretty harsh against Governor Jeb Bush tonight. You got along, you were complimentary towards him.
He was really nice. And I liked him. In fact, he even took, they put words in his mouth. Because these people were not so nice to me as far as I'm concerned. But they put words in his mouth, and he said I didn't say that. I thought that was a class act.
Yes. So, when you talk about the economy. And you mentioned 19 trillion in debt, we also have a 128 trillion in unfunded liabilities.
You don't want to even think about that -- it's terrible.
When the issue of tone came up. You said -- I think the quote was, "Excuse me, they're chopping off our heads. We don't have time for tone." Is it time for all American politicians to get rid of political correctness? Are you kind of leading the way?
No. I don't really think that, I think I'm leading the way at a certain high level of leadership. But, look, they're not that way. They're not inclined to be that way. But we need a leader at the top that will not worry so much about tone, that's going to get results. We don't have time for tone. And it is true; and Jeb, again, really nice guy, but he did criticize on tone, he thought my tone was a little tough, a little bit quick. We need strong tone. And we need enthusiasm, we need excitement and enthusiasm, because it's never going to get better.
There's never going to be an apology to Rosie. You're still glad you said all that to her.
She's terrible.
You wouldn't do that as president?
Probably not. Well, it sort of broke up the question from Megyn, which was an very nice question to start off with. But no, I'm not a fan of Rosie, but that's OK.
And you're in this to the end? You want this job?
I want this job, and I want to be the Republican. I want to be the Republican -- I'm the one who can beat Hillary. Believe me. Hillary's worst nightmare is me. Who treats it rougher than me? She should be going to prison for what she's done with the emails. Nobody even says that. What she's done is totally illegal. Look at General Petraeus, Sean. They've destroyed his life over doing much less than what she has done.
We appreciate it.
Great honor.
OK. Here we go.
Good morning.
So Donald, we've been talking about the debate. You were up there. Give us your thoughts.
Well, I had a great time. I enjoyed it. I think my questions were, you know, somewhat unfair. But it's fine. I was OK with it. But I really enjoyed it. I really liked -- I was with nine people and I really got to know some of them well and I liked them. A lot.
Who did you like a lot, personally?
Well, I thought Marco was terrific. I supported him in the past. I don't know that I've ever met him. I don't think I've met him. Very good guy. Walker, good guy. Carson, terrific guy. I've known him before. I got to know Jeb Bush really for the first time. He was a terrific guy. Really a nice guy.
Hey, Donald, it's Willie. Good to talk to you this morning.
Hello, Willie.
Good morning, Mr. Trump.
Hi, Jeremy.
Yes. Al Hunt is with us from Bloomberg. Al.
Hello, Al.
Thank you, Donald.
Very good. Thank you, Mika. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, everybody.
All right. But let's begin this half hour with Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump. He joins us now by phone. Mister Trump, good morning. Thanks for waking up early for us.
Good morning, Savannah.
Let me start with the good news. We've got a Drudge Report Poll that has you winning handily during this debate. A TIME magazine poll also says you won the debate. But here is some not so good news. A FOX focus group right after the debate, these are likely Republican voters, some called you narcissistic, mean, angry, bombastic. And one voter said, you know, I liked him when I came in here because he wasn't a politician. But right now he skirted around questions better than a lifelong politician ever had. Are you happy with your performance last night?
Well, I am. And that was done by a guy named Frank Luntz who is a real dunce, frankly. I don't know where he finds the people. But I think he picks them, I think he handpicks them to say whatever they want. Because it didn't -- it didn't jive with anything. I mean he's got his own little agenda.
But the focus group had fourteen supporters.
It doesn't matter.
Fourteen people that liked you at three when they were done.
Savannah, it depends where you get them. I can do focus groups, too. And I can say do this and do that. I don't -- I don't believe anything. You know, he came up to my office looking for a job, and looking for work. And then all of a sudden he's doing focus -- I had no interest in him. So, you know, I don't believe in that focus group. It was an unbelievable evening. I had a great time. Some of the contestants, some of the, you know, the folks that I met there were fantastic. And we've just had a great evening.
One of the big headlines of the night which came very early on when you decided not to take that pledge not to run as an independent if you were not to get the Republican nomination. And you said later to a host on FOX News the reason is you want to keep your leverage just in case the Republican Party doesn't treat you well. I guess my question is to you, is it more important that the Republican Party treats you well or that they win back the White House. Because everyone who looks at this thinks an independent run means a Democrat definitely keeps the White House.
Well, Savannah, many people want me to do the independent thing. I don't want to do that. I want to run as a Republican. Right now as you know because I watch your polls all the time with great interest, actually. But I'm way out in front. And I'm, you know, I'm enjoying it, I'm having a lot of fun, I'm getting great respect from the leaders of the Republican Party. And they see what's happening. There's like a movement going on. They're tired of -- the people are tired of these politicians that are all talk, no action. And -- and that's what's happening. So I want to run as a Republican. I want to win the primaries. I want to then run as a Republican. I think we will win. And certainly that gives us the best chance of winning. I don't want to do the independent thing. But I do keep it and it is leverage. And it is -- there are some very positive things about keeping it. But it's not something I want to do.
You were challenged a bit on some of the liberal positions you have taken in the past, the fact that you were once self- identified as a Democrat and you said, look, I have evolved the way Ronald Reagan evolved. And I guess my question this morning is how do Republican voters know you won't evolve again? In other words, they are looking for a candidate of principles. How do they know you're not going to change your mind and go back to being a Democrat?
Well, I used the name and I'm the one that brought it up. Because they say, you know, you were a Democrat. Now, if you look at New York City where I live, that's mostly Democrat. I mean you will very rarely see anything else but Democrat get into office. But -- and that's where I live. But I absolutely have gone the other way. I'm very proud of having gone the other way. But I use the example of Ronald Reagan all the time because he was a -- not only was he a Democrat, he was sort of on the liberal side of being a Democrat. So, you know, I've evolved. And I'm where I am. And I'm leading in the polls. And I want to run as a Republican, not as an independent. And I think it's going to work out very well. And so far it is. Even according to your polls.
Some of the toughest questions had to do with prior comments you have made about women. Do you have a problem with women? Is that going to be an issue in the general election? Because the -- the winner of the White House has got to win a huge portion of the female vote.
No, I don't think I do at all. In fact, if you look at The Apprentice which NBC renewed and desperately wanted to me do, but I said I'm not doing it because I'm running for President. I couldn't do it. You are not allowed to do it because of the, you know, equal time laws. But if you look, I mean, my -- the audience was women. And by the way, some of those -- some of the names mentioned were not names that were familiar to me. So we're going to look into that. But frankly, the biggest -- the biggest applause of the evening was when I mentioned the name Rosie O'Donnell. The place went wild. It was the loudest applause of the evening. People got a great kick out of it. And we all got a kick. And it was an amazing evening frankly and probably got tremendous ratings.
You were asked in particular about your past donations to Democrats, specifically your donations to Hillary Clinton. And you said, look, I make political donations because I want to get something in return. When asked specifically what you got in return from Hillary Clinton you said, well, I wanted her to come to my wedding and so she did.
Well, but I said that as a joke.
And before I let you go, you made no secret you didn't care for some of the questioning you've got last night. You felt like they were tough questions and unfair questions. And to that I just wonder if you don't like questions that you're coming from commentators during a debate, are you ready for the toughness of not only running for President but being President?
Well, I thought the questions were unfair. But I -- you know, I can live with it. You know, it's probably you're number one in the polls and they ask you a little bit tougher questions. But I have to tell you even the other candidates they got off stage and they said to me, you know, it's amazing that those questions were so unfair. They all felt how unfair those questions were. But, you know what, I enjoyed the evening. I thought they were unfair but that's OK. It was an amazing evening and I'm sure it was a great success. And based on the Drudge and based on TIME, and TIME magazine did a poll and, you know, the -- the numbers were astronomical in my favor. So maybe in your NBC poll I will even go up in two weeks when you -- when you reveal it again.
He's often...
I mean other than -- other than a couple of people, there's a couple of people actually over at Fox but it was a record breaking event. If I wasn't in the event, they probably would have done two or three million people max.
Yes. So...
So, you know, I'm very happy about it and most people say that I won the debate and I won it easily.
Let's take a look -- let's take a look at...
Hey, she is a lightweight. I couldn't care less about her. In fact, you are competing against her and I am doing your show. That's interesting.
You are polling very high. The first question, I have to ask you and I'm wondering if you think that Fox stacked the deck against you? And again I have to ask you this and if they were out to get you because that first question out of the gate was whether you would support the eventual nominee or run as an independent. Do you think that was a fair question?
Well, I don't think Fox treats me well. I really like the guys on "Fox & Friends". I do like Sean Hannity. He's a terrific guy. I like Bill O'Reilly. Bill O'Reilly is a fantastic guy but -- and Greta is great. But I, you know, I don't think that Fox, I mean they have Krauthammer who is, you know, the worst. They have George Will who is, you know, the dire George Will. He has nothing ever good to say about me and I could tell you why. I mean something happened 12 years ago where I did a number on him and I understand that, at least there I understand it.
What explain that, please, what do you mean?
I don't want to explain it. But he'll explain it.
OK.
But George Will is, you know, pathetic. I lost all respect frankly for Brett Baier. I knew him and I liked him but I really don't have any respect for him anymore because of the way he handle the situation. But in another way I am very proud of the fact that we broke the record, you know, under this because of me and one thing I will say it, every show NBC, ABC, CBS, they're all saying, "Donald Trump broke the record " that not even saying Fox, they're saying Donald Trump broke the record. So, you know I felt in one way, I am very happy about it.
Would you do another Fox debate again?
...had to be broken on your watch because, you know, the show was against you.
Yeah.
But that's OK. You can live with that, right?
Why can't you just say, not matter if it's a man or woman, no matter who the nominee is that you're going to support the Republican nominee no matter who it may.
Because I don't choose to do so, Don. That's all, I mean, what difference is it to you. I don't choose to do so. I will probably at some point do that. But right now -- I tell you I'm only looking forward to one thing. That's to running as a Republican and winning as a Republican.
Go ahead. Are you there, Mr. Trump?
Go ahead.
Yeah.
Can you hear me?
I just yet.
Yeah, I know had phone coming, but.
If you run as third party candidate the concern -- from Republicans that you're going to hand it over to -- a Democratic person whether it's Hillary Clinton.
Hey, Don, don't worry about it. OK, that's not your problem.
OK.
That's not your problem. So what happens is, you know, look, I'm leading as a Republican. Obviously it's better to run as a Republican. But I'm leading as the Republican. That's what my choice is. And if I'm treated fairly and with respect I will -- and even if I don't get it. I would, you know, most likely go ahead and not do that.
Yeah.
But if from the other hand I am not. I very well might. Now, at some point I may switch over and make everybody happy and, I'd be happy also.
Yeah.
I will say with that being said I'm being treated very nicely by the RNC and Reince and everybody. They're treating me very nicely. And that's basically what I want. I want a level playing field.
Yeah.
And if I've get a level playing field fairness, that is highly unlikely that I do the other, which would be, you would call it third party.
Yeah. Well, I don't need to press you any longer. Because you've answered the question. You said that you would not like to not do that. So I think you answer the question. I think we spent...
No, I'd like to not do that. Because the best way to winning is -- if I win, if I get the nomination, if I get the Republican nomination, I will beat Hillary. And I don't believe anybody else beat Hillary.
OK. Do you say that you won the debate?
If she runs by the way. Because I'm not sure she's going to run with her problems on the email.
Yeah.
I'm not very sure she's going to be running. She's got some big problems. I mean, General Petraeus did a lot worse than -- a lot better than her. I mean, she was far worse than him. And you look at what's going on. And they destroyed his life. So I'm not so sure she's going to escape the whole email thing. But we'll find out pretty soon.
When you and President Clinton spoke, what did you discuss?
Well, that's none of your business. But it was really routine. And I will say I was -- my mind, when we spoke I mean, is where this is where most of it was written incorrectly. My mind was already fully made up. In other words I was already going to run. So when we spoke, when he called my mind was already, you know, totally made up. I was already running essentially. So, you know, there was nothing big. But I've known them over the years. And, you know, I hadn't spoken to him in a long time. But my mind was totally made up.
Did he encourage you to run?
My mind was made up a long time ago.
And let's...
And we just have incompetent leadership and it's horrible what is going on, so...
... let's...
... the message is out there and people are liking what I am saying. And I will make this country great again and we can do it relatively fast, but we to get working soon., because if we continue to go this path we are not going to be able to bring it back.
But speaking, speaking...
.... let's put it that way...
... Iraq...
... I never went, but Don just again, you know, I never went bankrupt. Neither did the other guys like me that uses -- that used that particular law.
Yeah, but you did use that, but speaking of Iraq, what did you think of Jeb Bush's answer on, on about Iraq?
It's a terrible answer and it was a terrible answer that took five days to give. And it was a simple question I mean it was a question that was extremely easy to understand, and you know, it was like, was Iraq a good thing or a bad thing? Now we spent $2 trillion, lost thousand of lives, have wounded warriors who I love all over the place and we have nothing, we have nothing.
Yeah.
And Iran is taking over Iraq and if they're taking the oil and ISIS is taking some of the oil also so between Iran and ISIS they're going to split up Iraq. And we spent dollars, a terrible thing...
And speaking...
... and he wasn't sure -- and he still wasn't sure was it good or bad is up to him, you know, what they do, they go after the politicians. They go out and, get, you know, sound bites from people that work for them. I mean, you know, it's like -- let's, took him five day to answer the question OK, was it good or was it bad?
And with speaking of Jeb...
You know, this not what we need, this is not what we need.
... speaking of Jeb Bush -- last night you also asked, last night about reports that he had called you some pretty nasty names, he denied it and instead of going...
He denied it.
Instead of going after you, you called him a gentleman.
He was very nice. He denied it. And why are you bringing it up?
Why me -- you called him...
He was very nice, you know, what he was very nice and I...
Well let me finish the question if you will with all due respect.
Go ahead.
So you called him a gentlemen, you've ben insulting Jeb Bush for weeks saying that he is weak, I'm just wondering what changed between you two?
No I didn't say he's weak I, you know, he talked about tone. He said Trump's tone is very tough it is very strong. And I said, no you don't understand we have to have a tough tone. They're cutting off Christian's head and everyone else's heads in Syria and Iraq and they're blowing everything up and the people are dying all over the place including the border which I didn't bring it up you wouldn't even beef talking about the border, you wouldn't even be talking about illegal immigration, Don...
Mr...
... and, you know, sort of an interesting thing people say, oh you can't build the wall well the truth is the Great Wall of China is 13,000 mile. This one if you match it out to the end is 2,000 miles and that was built 2,000 years ago, more than 2,000 years ago so, you know, you can very easily build it.
So I want...
Total lightweight.
Mr. Trump, you know, you wrote the art of the deal so you know how this stuff...
That that is true.
... but this stuff works going into this you were the front- runner. You knew you would be targeted possibly attacked. Do you worry that it undermines you're a tough guy and there's a I'm going to stand up to Putin, to China, to Mexico etcetera yet your demeanor might suggest, it might suggest to people that you are thin-skinned?
No, I don't think I'm thin skinned. I think I'm the toughest -- yeah, I think I'm fine but I don't like when I'm treated unfairly and I'm not saying change it. Did I tell you to change anything? I said I'm fine with it but I you know, I like to expose people. I mean, I expose Megyn Kelly as not being very good. I could tell you other things about Megyn Kelly that would be very harsh but I won't bother with that. But Megyn Kelly is not a good professional and she's just not, in my opinion, she's not good at what she does.
Well, I don't...
I'm not complaining, I'm not saying do it over, I'm not suing Fox, I'm not doing anything. I mean Fox should love me because I just broke the all-time record and if I'm not in there, the Jazz in the other guys, they're going to get one million viewers and got 24 million because I was in there. So, you know, they must love me, but in actuality, they probably don't and I don't even care.
Just so you know, Megyn Kelly is a very respected journalist and...
I don't think she's respected. What is she? She's a lightweight.
... many people think she is.
She's a lightweight. I can't believe that you're not beating her in the ratings actually. You should be ashamed of yourself. If I had your show, I'd be beating her so badly she'd be thrown off the air. That I can tell you, Don. I'm very surprised at you, Don. I'm just kidding.
I know that you are and I think people...
But I'm not kidding. If I had your show, believe me she would have no chance. She wouldn't be on the air very long, that I can tell you.
Well you can come on any time and you're welcome any time. I want to ask you though before I let you go, the CNN debate is September 16th. Are you going to do anything differently to prepare for that?
No, I look I did -- according to everybody I won. According to everybody I won other than the haters and the losers but according to you know, the polls, according to Drudge, according to Time Magazine, according to The New York Times story, according to many other stories, Washington Post, I won.
Yeah.
Now, you know, why should I prepare differently? You know, preparing for a debate is hard because there's so much knowledge you have to have you wouldn't be able to prepare I mean you can't, you can't, you know study in one week what you've learned over a lifetime.
Listen, I'm not going to make that deal because you would hold me to it I know that you would -- by the way just so...
... you better be careful. I'm glad you said it because I may hold you to it, you're right.
Just so you know, Megyn Kelly is not my competitor. She's on at 90's and I'm on at 10 which as so happens that...
I know that.
Yes.
Number one's like not even close. Anything having to do with finance, jobs and the economy, I was number one, by like far. They were left way in the dust. And that's what our country need, Don.
So then what do you do then? You talk about -- you're right, you're in number one in the categories but then in your favorability, you don't always you know always at the top of...
And my favorability has come way up, Don. If you are being honest, you know.
Yeah.
I agree with you two, three months ago because people didn't know my message and they know me but they didn't know me in this position. But if you looked at my favorability recently, my favorability, in fact, somebody said they have never seen anything like it. The favorabilty is long. Look at the new Fox poll that just came out where I'm at I think 26 percent and the nearest opponent is what, 12 percent, 14 percent or something like that.
You had...
And my favorability has become very good.
You had 24...
In the New Hampshire -- excuse me -- in the New Hampshire poll, the favorability swung all the way into the very positive. So, yeah, no the favorability is doing good now, Don. You got to look at the modern poll.
Donald Trump, you're welcome to come co-host with me any time and we thank you for joining us.
OK good. We'll beat everybody. You and I will beat everybody.
I really do appreciate you coming on.
All right, thank you very much, Don. Thank you very much..
But, first, joining me on the phone is the man at the center of it all, the Republican front-runner, Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, thanks so much for calling in. We appreciate it.
Good morning, Jake.
That's right.
Nobody said anything.
You did.
But I said the exact same thing about Chris Wallace.
But then you said she had blood...
Correct. And then I said...
So, Erick Erickson...
And only -- and, by the way, Jake, let me just tell you this.
Yes?
Only a deviant would say that what I said was what they were referring to, because nobody can make that statement. You almost have to be sick to sort of put that together, I think.
Well, among that list of deviants would be Erick Erickson...
Well, take a look at his past.
... Jeb Bush, Lindsey -- Lindsey Graham.
First of all, he's a loser.
Carly Fiorina.
Jake -- Jake, Carly Fiorina. OK, give me a break. She's got -- she's got zero chance.
Let me ask you a question, sir.
He's been my biggest...
Let me just ask you a question, sir. Do you -- I understand you're saying that you did not mean to suggest that Megyn Kelly was having her period. You were saying...
Of course I didn't, Jake.
OK.
Who would say that? Hey, Jake, I went to the Wharton School of Finance. I was an excellent student. I'm a smart person. I built a tremendous company. I had a show called The Apprentice  that NBC desperately wanted me to do another season.
Yes.
Right?
No, you're...
And the national polls, I'm winning by double digits.
I wasn't there.
They were very unhappy.
Appreciate it.
Thank you.
So -- so...
But, you know...
Well, I mean it...
-- George?
So -- so you're...
-- George, part of the problem we have in this country, we're trying to be so politically correct that nobody can say anything anymore...
But that -- that is the country you're...
-- and it's a disgrace.
-- that's the cre -- that's the country you're trying to become president of right now, and there is this impression out there that you've had this history of misogynist statements, that you are anti-women. You are responding to it right now, but you got people like the chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party saying you are a chauvinist. How are you going to combat that impression? Isn't it a problem for you?
I don't think so at all, George. In the meantime, I'm doing very well in the polls with women. I've hired women, I have thousands working for me right now. They're doing phenomenally well in the top levels. I am doing great in the polls. You know, speaking about New Hampshire, I'm leading New Hampshire. I'm leading Iowa. I'm leading North Carolina and South Carolina. I'm leading the -- and I mean, when I say leading, by big numbers leading, by very big. The numbers just came in from Georgia, I'm leading Georgia by phenomenal, by big numbers, and I'm leading in every national poll, and in some cases by double digits, and those are women voters, largely. And I'm doing very well with the women voters.
You now say you're against that. But why were you for it then, why are you against it now?
George, at the time, I was willing to do it. I was wealthy even then. That was a long time ago, but I was willing to do it, and it was a suggestion. I would have loved to have seen the national debt be paid off. We're going to soon be over $20 trillion, 18, actually close to 19 now. We're going to be more than $20 trillion. We should have paid off the national debt one way or the other.
Let me ask about you that. Back in 1999, you were for the wealth tax. You were for single payer.
I was willing to do it. I was certainly willing to do it.
I get that you were for that, then. You were for single payer then. You're not for it now. How can conservatives trust that you're not going to change again?
Look, Ronald Reagan was a Democrat. In fact, he was on the liberal side of being a Democrat. And he changed, and he did a very good job. And I worked with him, and he liked me a lot, and I liked me a lot. But I worked with him. And he was a terrific guy, but he was a Democrat, and George, he was sort of a liberal Democrat, and he changed. And I have evolved, and I have evolved very strongly, and I'm a conservative and I have tremendous support, but I also have a lot of support among Democrats. You know, when you do your polls, if you look at your polls, I have support from all over the place, and people are actually shocked by it. Mr. Trump, you're leading in every poll.
And you have supported Democrats more recently. Back in 2006, you and your son gave $77,000 to Democrats. That was the election that brought Nancy Pelosi to power, brought Harry Reid to power. They've since passed President Obama's agenda. Conservatives are against that. So how can conservatives trust you when you recently gave so much money to their opponents?
Because, George, I made a net worth, I have a net worth of over $10 billion. I have been a world-class businessman, which is by the way what this country needs to make good trade deals instead of the way we're being ripped off by China and Japan and Mexico and everybody else. I was a businessman. I was a businessperson, and I supported everybody, because as a businessperson, you had to. And when I needed something, people were always there for me. If I supported somebody and three years later I needed something, they were always there for me. And by the way, George, I have to say this, that's what's wrong with the system. The lobbyists, the donors, all of these --
Donald Trump, thanks very much very much your time this morning.
Thank you very much, George.
When you -- on that first...
I hope you agree. I hope you agree with that. Do you agree with that, by the way?
That you wouldn't have had 24 million people?
You certainly wouldn't have.
Let me ask...
... and has a terrible track record. And I don't even know if she's going to be able to be in, because what she's done with the emails is so ridiculous that it's probably criminal.
Let me ask you...
So, we're doing really well.
I'm joined now on the phone from New York by Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS.
Thank you, Chuck.
So why can't you -- then why can't you just apologize for saying, you know what, I'm sorry some people took it the wrong way. You seem to have an allergy -- you seem to have an allergy toward apologizing.
No, I apologize when I'm wrong but I haven't been wrong. I said nothing wrong. It's a very common statement. I've said it -- excuse me, I said it about Chris Wallace. I said there was blood pouring -- because he tried to question me and he's a small shadow of his father, Mike. That I can tell you. But I said it about Chris Wallace. Chris Wallace came out and I said there was blood pouring out of his eyes. Nobody asked me about apologizing.
Maybe the next time we will be able to do issues.
We will. I hope so, Chuck. That's what I want to do, jobs and the economy. That's what I really want to do.
All right. Thank you, sir. We'll talk to you soon.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Bye.
Good morning to you. Welcome to the program. The viewers are excited to have you here. Thanks for doing it for us.
Good to be with you.
Let's unpack a little bit of what you just laid out there for us. I'll give you the deflection on whether or not you need to make an assurance to women. You said that you'd be the best for them ever. You don't like what Jeb Bush said. You said it was an epic mistake. Is that your way of saying that you think Planned Parenthood should be funded because of all the health care that it provides outside of abortions to women, especially women of low means?
Well, the biggest problem I have with Planned Parenthood is the abortion situation. It's like an abortion factory. You can't have it and you shouldn't be funding it and that should not be funded by the government. I feel strongly about that. That's my biggest problem with Planned Parenthood because it really -- if you look at it and you look at the work they do, it really has become so heavily centered on abortion. You can't have that.
They say it's only 3 percent of what they do and the money that does go toward abortions is not the money that comes from the federal government. That they separate the two.
This is what I would do, if the time came, I would look at the individual things that they do and maybe some of the things are good, and maybe -- I know a lot of the things are bad. But certainly the abortion aspect of it should not be funded by government.
So you would take a look at it before defunding it. That's what's being asked for right now. Many in your party are doing the opposite. They're saying defund it, then look. You'd say look at it first?
I would look at the good aspects of it and I would also look because I'm sure they do some things properly and good and good for women. I would look at that. I would look at other aspects, also. But we have to take care of women. We have to absolutely take care of women. The abortion aspect of Planned Parenthood should not be funded.
Well, you do know that there is a big political debate on this and that many women believe that you do protect them by protecting their right to choose and that's something that Planned Parenthood allows. Marco Rubio, someone running against you, says he doesn't believe in any carve outs for rape or incest. That there's no abortion on any level, no matter what. Do you agree with that?
I disagree with that. I am for the exceptions. You have the three exceptions. I'm for the exceptions. The health of the mother and life of the mother. I absolutely am for the exceptions, and so was Ronald Reagan for the exceptions, by the way. There's nothing wrong with that. You have to do it, in my opinion. Now Marco took a very strong stand. I respect him for that. He believes that. It's just a different thing. I am for the exceptions, yes.
Do you pay them what you pay the men?
So I was very, very pro women many years ago. I found they are incredible executives.
Do you pay them the same as men?
They are absolutely incredible executives. So I get the picture better than anybody.
Do you pay them the same that you pay the men?
It's something that I'm spending very closely and I will make a decision on soon.
Do you pay the women at the top of your organization the same way you pay the men?
Yes, I do. Absolutely.
One campaign suggestion for you, you should show those numbers to people and let them see that women don't only make the same, they make more.
Well, I can do that. But, you know, one of the things that I alluded to, one of the things I'm very proud of is, you know, I was one of the first -- I think I was literally the first. I had a woman in charge of the construction of Trump Tower. That was unheard of in the construction industry that many years ago. So, I was -- you know, I'm very proud of that fact. I have gotten a lot of credit over the years, especially within the construction industry. You didn't have women at the construction industry at high levels. I think I was the first to do it, in charge of major developments.
But you got to have --
But here is the point, Chris, I wouldn't sit down and draw a plan that tomorrow, I will go and have a meeting. The next day, I'll go and make an offer. I went in and I got it. I went in and I got Turnberry in Scotland. That's one of the great resorts of the world. Everybody wanted it. I didn't wait around to do a 14-point plan. I went in and got it. So a lot of this stuff, you don't want to hear about the plans, you got to get in and you got to get it done.
Yeah, but you know that that's not the way it works. You can't get in there not telling people what you are going to do.
Our tax code -- Chris -- Our tax code -- I know every form of tax, believe me, from the vats to the fair tax to -- every single form of tax. Our tax code is too complicated. We can simplify it so easily.
How?
Using intelligence. By having common sense.
This is the first time I've had Trump on, if I may speak about you in the third person.
When I say Trump, I'm saying Trump or Trump-related. OK?
Oh, I got you.
Trump-related, definitely.
Well, look, as you know --
And you'll have me on again.
We offer an open forum to everybody. I want you to get these ideas out there. You've talked about the military, you say you'd hand it to ISIS, the Iran deal stinks. People are going to want to know how you --
What did you say? I'd hand what to ISIS?
You hand it to ISIS. You would give it to them. You know, you would really take them on. You said --
So, your definition of hand it is a lot different than mine.
No, I'm not saying that you would give something to them.
I would go in and knock the hell out of them. There's no question about that.
How would you knock the hell out of them?
I would take the oil away, I'd take their money away, I'd take their source of money way. I'd make sure that --
How do you take the oil?
-- Saudi Arabia -- and by the way, Iran, which gives plenty of money to is ISIS, I would make sure -- believe it or not, Iran is funneling money into ISIS, too. Iraq is going to Iran just like I predicted in 2004.
So how do you do it? Do you put troops on the ground?
I would go in and take the oil and I'd put troops to protect the oil. I would absolutely go and I'd take the money source away. And believe me, they would start to wither and they would collapse.
But that's not exactly how it works. If they don't do what they need to do, there is a snapback.
It's the dumbest deal. It's going to go down as one of the dumb deals of all time. And one of the most dangerous deals ever signed.
There is a snapback provision, though, that if they don't do what they are supposed to, then the sanctions get back in. I mean, that's one of the things they're protecting --
No, but I'm talking about the $150 billion and all the other money they are going to be getting. They are getting a fortune. They are getting tremendous amounts of money even if the deal doesn't get approved --
There's no question they are going to get money.
-- they are still getting much of what they wanted to get --
The question becomes what was the better deal? What would you do? You know you can't sit down --
What would I have done?
Yes.
First of all, I would have doubled the sanctions. Then I would have said, before we start, I want our prisoners back, then after that I would have made a good deal and there wouldn't have been 24 days --
But your allies aren't with you on the sanctions, they want to do business.
I don't care -- That's part of leadership, you got to get the allies with you. You got to get them. Of course Putin is not going to -- I mean, the different people that are involved aren't going to be with you. You know why? Because they have no respect for our president.
But what do you think happens? If you are sitting across from Rouhani or Vladimir Putin and you look at them and you say you get out of Ukraine and he says make me. Now what?
Ukraine is a whole different subject.
All right, fine. Then stick with Iran.
You're bringing up a lot of different subjects. Listen. Excuse me. Ukraine, why isn't Germany and Europe fighting for Ukraine? Why are we involved so much with Ukraine instead of Germany? Germany is a very powerful, very rich country. They don't owe money like we do. They don't have a $19 trillion number on their ballot sheet that's going to destroy them.
But if you're sitting --
Why -- Excuse me, Chris -- Why isn't Germany, which is tremendously powerful and very strong and has probably the greatest leader in the world right now in Merkel -- why isn't Germany fighting Russia? Why is it always the United States? We are like the policemen of the world.
Germany, as you know very well, doesn't have that kind of military capacity that the U.S. has and there are reasons for that as well.
But they have tremendous economic power. They can crush Russia. They have tremendous economic strength.
But they have their own interests. Look, I know you know this stuff, Mr. Trump, and forgive me if it sounds like I'm teaching you about the world. You know it and I know you know it. But I'm saying that there's a tendency to oversimplify situations. People buy into that and then you're setting them up for disappointment. There's a reason that Germany doesn't do it.
Sometimes oversimplification is a good thing. Sometimes we make it too complicated. I'm just saying this --
Yeah, but when you are sitting with Iran -- when you are sitting at the table -- Give me one second, Mr. Trump. When you're sitting at the table with Iran, and you say, I'm going to double the sanctions, and all of your partners get up and leave because they want to do commerce, and you say you are not getting a nuke -- and the Iranians say we already have it. We could have it tomorrow if we want it.
Excuse me, they won't leave if I'm president because they are going to respect our country and respect me. They are going to do what I tell them to do. We have a lot of power over those countries. They won't leave. They will do the sanctions.
Why would you do this deal if you didn't absolutely have to?
And by the way, the sanctions wouldn't even be long-term. You would bring Iran to the table. Why didn't we get our prisoners back? You know what they said? They said we are not going to ask for the prisoners. Chris, we're not going to ask, because it will complicate the negotiation. And yet we gave back a nuclear scientist to Iran. We gave them back the nuclear scientist that they wanted. We can't ask for four prisoners that are sitting there. One of them is there because he's a Christian, in a horrible prison. He's there because he's a Christian. I met his wife. She's an amazing woman. She doesn't know what to do. We don't even bring it up. I'll tell you what, I guarantee you that if I were president, this deal wouldn't be made, a deal would be made that's 100 times better. What about --
100 times better. What is the deal that's 100 times better?
Chris, what about 24 days to go and inspect. You have 24 days. And what people don't say is before you get to the 24 days, it takes a long time because you have to start a process.
Right. But look, you're not giving any benefit of the doubt to the fact that they had to negotiate something. Of course you'd rather inspect right away, than with any kind of notice. How do you know there was an alternative?
Chris, they're incompetent. They're incompetent negotiators.
Well, they would say they negotiated on at every point.
And if the deal doesn't get passed, they get all of this money. They still get the money even if there's no deal, they're getting billions and billions of dollars. We are represented by incompetent people. Let me tell you, the sanctions will be doubled because I will convince Germany and I will convince all of the countries that we're talking about --
India, China, you know, people want to do business.
I'll convince them. China -- We have so much power over China. China has gotten rich over us. China has rebuilt itself with the money it's sucked out of the United States and the jobs that it's sucked out of the United States. We have tremendous power over China --
Did you ever use Chinese money on any of your project?
Excuse me?
He's a good man.
He's been a very good friend of mine. He's somebody I have great respect for. I was very angry with the way I was treated and, you know, perhaps justifiably. I think justifiably. But Roger Ailes, who is an amazing guy and an amazing executive, frankly, he called me yesterday and as far as I'm concerned, I'm fine with it.
So you're over it. Was part of the deal that Megyn Kelly wouldn't go on her show and attack you and keep it going?
No, I don't care that -- I mean, we didn't even discuss that. It's not about Megyn Kelly.
She doesn't come up at all when you were talking to Roger Ailes?
It's not about that. Look, there was a misinterpretation of what I said. Look, what I said was obvious. There was nothing wrong -- Unless you're a deviant, you don't put those words in. A couple of people tried to make a big issue out of it. That's not it. Roger's done an amazing job at Fox. He called me and I have no problems.
You know what it was. The reason that people were inclined to see it that way was because of the other things you've said in the past about women, which is why I started this early on about whether or not you wanted to apologize for those.
Well, maybe that is -- I mean, I don't know what it is exactly but I don't know how you could have been -- Hey, look, I went to the hardest school to get into, the best school in the world, I guess you could say, the Wharton School of Finance, it's like super genius stuff. I came, out I built a tremendous company, I had tremendous success. "The Art of the Deal, " The Apprentice, everything. Who would -- Would make a statement like that? I didn't make a statement -- In fact -- Chris, if you think about it --
Smart men aren't always good to women though. Right?
I've always been good to women. Nobody will be better to women as a president because I'll take care -- when I talk about health issues, I will take care of women like nobody else can. Certainly Jeb Bush doesn't even know what he's talking about. He admitted that the other day. And believe me, that will be his 47 percent. That will be the statement just like it took down Romney, the 47 percent, his statement on women's health issues will take him down.
Well, it will if somebody else is offering ideas that are so much better than his and they highlight a deficiency. That's a task for you and the other candidates.
Perhaps. But I think you're going to see that come along very, very soon. And you know what? You do have to have flexibility. Remember what I say -- When these guys come and issue these plans and they're hard and fast, you've got to go with the punches like the boxer said.
Right. But you have to have a core set of ideas.
You have to have certain flexibility. You have to be able to -- You have to get it through this vast web. Nobody knows politics better than I do. I've dealt with politicians all my life. You have to get this through and passed through a vast web. We can't just keep signing executive orders all over the place.
Right. But --
So I want to have flexibility. I have to.
But you have to have core principles that people can grab onto and vote for you.
I will take care of women's health issues and guys like Bush -- and by the way, Hillary Clinton won't. She won't take care of it like I will. Believe me.
How can you say that? How can you say Hillary Clinton won't take care of women's health the way you will?
Because I know my capability and I think I know her capability and I'm much more capable than she is.
But some would say that for women, just on the issue of being pro-choice alone would give her an advantage.
Well, some would, but there are plenty of women that agree with me on that issue, with the excepts -- you know that. But there are plenty of women that agree with me on that. We're not just talking about me. Many women agree. That's not just a man issue. That's a woman issue too.
Absolutely. I understand that. But let me ask you one last thing here. I don't want to keep you too long. How you're conducting yourself is an issue that's been a plus/minus for you. This morning, although everything's supposed to be OK with Fox, in "The New York Post " which is, of course, one of their properties, one of their columnists, Rich Lowry, says that you are the most fabulous whiner in the world and that you've shown that if you were to sit across from a Putin or from Mexico or from the Middle East leaders, that as soon as they said something you don't like you would become a whiner, you'd become snipy with them and that you wouldn't get anything done. What do you say to that?
Well, I think he's probably right. I am the most fabulous whiner. I do whine because I want to win. And I'm not happy if I'm not winning.
Are whiners winners?
And I am a whiner and I'm a whiner and I keep whining and whining until I win. And I'm going to win for the country and I'm going to make our country great again. Our country right now is a debtor nation, we have airports that are third world airports, we have roadways that are falling apart, we have bridges that are coming down and that are unsafe. 60 percent of the bridges in this country need work and they're unsafe.
But how do you pass that infrastructure bill? How do you work with government? You can't just come back at everybody when they insult you.
Chris, I've been better at working wit government. I've made -- Hey, Chris, I'm worth more than $10 billion. I've been working with government all my life. That's what I do --
But you've also been very rough on people over the years. It's worked for you, but in politics it's a little different.
Well, sometimes you have to be rough, though, Chris.
I know. But you can't always be rough.
I know you and I know your brother. And your brother is a rough cookie. He's a good guy but he's a rough cookie.
There's a price for being rough.
And he gets things done and you get things done. You're a rough guy.
You've been rough. You threatened to sue me and my parents for giving birth to me.
No, I would never do that.
That's exactly what you did. You play very rough sometimes.
No, no, no. They did a great service for the world. And you know, I'm a huge fan of your mother. I don't know. You know, your mother and my mother know each other.
Well, she's watching right now, so don't say anything about me. She'll be very upset. You know how she felt about your parents.
Well, I'm a huge fan of your mother and my mother loved your mother and, you know, they knew each other from Queens. They went to the same beauty parlor together, right?
We grew up in the same place. That's right. They did. We won't talk about the styles that they had done to them, but they did go to the same --
I'm not sure about the style, but it was OK.
Listen, I appreciate you coming on NEW DAY. You know I'm pushing on these solutions because that, at the end of the day, is what makes the difference. A lot of people judge you for what you say because they don't have the policy ideas to test you on and that's going to be something that's going to have to transition for you to be successful in the race.
Chris, I have policy and I know policy better than anybody --
But you got to give the ideas, Mr. Trump.
You can't just go in and say we're going to do -- It has to be flexible. I know policy better than anybody. I know politics as well as anybody. I've been doing it all my life. And I've been doing it from the other side, which in a certain way gives you a better perspective. But you will see what's going to happen. A lot of positive things are going to happen.
But you know that people to vote for you, they're going to have to have more than a promise. They're going to have to have a central set of ideals about ideas, which way you'll take it, what a top tax rate is, how many people you'd put into these bad places, American fighting men and women --
Sure, you're going to have that --
-- how long you'd leave them there --
Once you get into office it's going to change because you have a big negotiation to go through with Congress. And you will lead Congress to the right place. That's what leadership is all about.
And if you do that -- You've got to work with them differently than you do --
All I know is I just looked at three polls that came out. I'm leading Iowa big. And another one just came out where nationally I'm 32 percent. So I must be doing something right. I don't know.
How do you fix it?
They're waiting four or five days to see a doctor and at the end of the sixth day a doctor goes out and says, I'm sorry, I can't see you, I'm going on vacation.
The problems are open and notorious. The fix has been elusive. Do you have one?
I will fix it. Believe me. That's what I do in life. I fix it. I'm not a politician. Politicians are all talk and no action, Chris. I'm the opposite.
Mr. Trump, thank you for coming on NEW DAY. As the campaign continues, we invite you back to discuss the issues and your solutions to them.
Thank you very much, Chris.
Have a good day, sir.
So long.
All right, let's start with the elephant in the room. The Fox issue is resolved? And how did that come about?
Well, I have a great relationship with Roger Ailes. And actually, I didn't understand what went wrong because I felt it wasn't really -- I was not treated fairly. And Roger called me the other day, and it's absolutely fine.
Illegally.
Illegally. Totally illegally. And just last night and yesterday, you had a horrible killing where that same thing with the illegal, where a 66-year-old woman who was raped -- from the military, who was raped and beaten and tortured by this animal. And all of a sudden, you know, people are seeing these horrible crimes that are being committed by illegal...
Six hundred and forty-two thousand crimes...
Oh, it's terrible.
Let's assume you're treated fairly in the process, you didn't win the nomination. At that point, you would support the Republican candidate.
That's true. That's true. Now, I'd also like to see a candidate that I like and that I respect and that I agree with, OK? I'd never go to the other side.
Let me ask you this. Hillary Clinton -- her husband had all these problems with women. She hasn't said a word. If it's you versus Hillary, is that fair game, that issue?
I guess it is. Look, he would have had a much different presidency if he didn't have Monica and all of these things that happened during his...
But -- but do you think that the Clinton Foundation, when Hillary takes money from Saudi Arabia or these countries that treat women horribly, and then she's going to lecture you on comments you make about women? Is that hypocrisy?
I think it probably turned out to be maybe not the right thing. Now, if you took that money -- look, in all defense of her in this case -- if she took that money and used it really for the good -- but a lot of that money was used for private transportation.
Did they buy her silence? In other words, she hasn't been critical of them. She took the money for the foundation.
Well, you had not only that, how about the speeches, where you're getting...
They found four classified emails. She said there weren't any. And that's only out of 40, and there's 60,000 emails total. Do you think she committed a crime?
I think she committed a crime. The problem that she -- that let's say everybody has in terms of finding out, you have Democrats are all the prosecutors, and they don't want to prosecute her. Did she commit a crime? Yes. Will they prosecute it? Perhaps no.
So when the Saudis give her money and all these other countries gave money, were they buying access to her?
Absolutely. There's no question about it. They were buying access.
This system is at its root corrupt.
Well, Jeb Bush is totally controlled by the people that gave him that money. And the nice part about me, I don't want anybody's money. I don't want any money.
You have $345 million in liquid assets. Are you prepared to spend that much money or more?
Sure. Well, you saw my income. My income's $400 million a year.
But are you prepared to spend it?
Sure, I would spend it, if I'm doing well.
So through a tariff? Whatever means necessary, you're going to say, If you want to do business with the U.S....
We're not paying for it. Of course.
Solves a lot of their social problems.
Not only the social problems...
By keeping the border open...
Do you know how...
... ostensibly, they're saying go.
Do you know how expensive it is to house these people in a prison, where you have a killer, like the killer of Kate or the killer of the woman yesterday, who killed a 66-year-old woman and raped her and tortured her? Do you know how expensive it is to keep people like that?
They don't want to solve it. Let me ask you, again, go to specifics, details.
Go ahead.
Obamacare -- what's your alternative?
OK, so you can do the savings account concept, which is a concept that a lot of people...
Premiums are up on average 40 percent this year.
Oh, it's up, and going up a lot more than that.
Right.
It's no good. How about the deductibles? The deductibles, unless you hit by a truck, you're never going to even be able to use it.
Right.
So Obamacare  is no good, doesn't work. One of the first things I'd do if I get elected, end Obamacare  and do something really good. Whether it's that -- one of the things we have to do is we have to get rid of these artificial state lines that were put in only for the insurance companies. They make a fortune.
Every American would have that choice.
Everybody would have that choice. But the insurance companies don't want that because they essentially have a monopoly.
Also, you get catastrophic insurance as part of that.
You get catastrophic. You get everything. You'd get a much better plan. You'd have a much cheaper insurance. And you know what? Other than the one thing, you would want the country -- the only thing I'd want from the government, I want to make sure those companies are very solid and strong. So maybe they even get a little point or something, and they guarantee it because the one thing you don't want is a company goes bust, and you're sitting there and you paid all your life into this, you know, company. You don't want that to happen.
You'd protect people with preexisting conditions. You'd protect...
I would do that. I would do it. You -- you can get everything in Obamacare, but much more. Look, in Obamacare  for the most part, a lot of people -- they don't have their doctor. They don't have the plan they want.
Let me ask you, you talked about Planned Parenthood. Another example, talk about a war on women. Look at the number of abortions they perform every year. Half a billion dollars taxpayer money goes to them. You said you would have shut down the government to defund them. You also talked about some of the good things that they do.
They do good things.
Your critics say you haven't given any. You're giving them today.
Well, I'm giving a lot, I think.
Ninety-three million Americans now out of the labor force.
Right.
Fifty-seven million of those are women. Forty-six million Americans are on food stamps. Fifty million Americans are in poverty -- staggering numbers!
It's amazing.
When you -- when you think...
And then you hear there's a 5.4 percent unemployment.
OK...
It's not 5.4.
... that's a lie.
It's really -- if you add it up, it's probably 40 percent, if you really think about it.
It's high, and it's only Washington math that gives you that number.
Yes, it's phony math.
Here's my question. So when you think about your economic plan and you think of those statistics, what are the top three things that come to your mind, specifically, that you can do to help the 93 million, the 57 million Americans, the 50 million in poverty?
Sure. I love the question because this is my strength.
Right.
You know, a competitor of yours did a big poll. I won't say it was CNN, OK, because I...
You can say whatever you want.
But they did a big poll, OK? And the poll came out...
What is the tariff on an American car?
Well, we've -- they make cars in Mexico. They just send them across the border. How does it help us? I went to the Wharton School of Finance. Tell me, how does it help us? It doesn't help us at all.
Were you really number one in your class?
I was a good student. I was a very good student. People are shocked by that, but I was actually...
Sure, one of the greatest presidents.
By the way some -- and a great president. And a great leader, a great -- he had something very special. But if you think of it, he was a little bit less conservative, actually, than people think.
Would you still support it?
I would take -- the problem is we owe so much now, I mean...
Wouldn't it hurt the economy because they spend less on business?
You know, I think we've got to get rid of the -- we have a problem.
Yes, I want to get to that in a minute.
We have a problem, and the problem is the $19 trillion because I was saying $18 trillion, but now it's really $19 trillion.
Did he say yes?
He said yes. He'll do whatever I want. He's a patriot. He loves the country. And he's -- you know what, he's made a lot of money, he's done a great job. He would love to do this. Me, too. I love what I'm doing outside of this. And actually, I'm enjoying this more than I thought, to be honest. It helps with all these polls coming in.
You'd like it --
I don't know if I'd like it if I was down to two percent. But -- but Carl Icahn is a great businessman. He would love to be able to help.
We do nothing about it, as you say. And President Obama, his Treasury secretary, the Federal Reserve, actually, none of them willing to say that this is direct intervention by the Chinese government in the currency marketplace and that it is manipulation of the yuan, their currency, by the way, that goes back to, as you know, President George W. Bush...
Right.
... who was also...
That's true.
... extremely reluctant to...
Right.
A formidable -- and I have to tell you I wouldn't mind imagining what would -- that conversation would sound like.
Oh, that would be a beauty. We could make a movie out of that one!
And on the issue of illegal immigration, you've been very straightforward. You want to build a wall, I think, as you put it -- and I'm maybe not quoting you precisely, but a big glorious door in the middle of it, which I inferred was a metaphor to suggest you would bring people into this country...
Right.
... but on the terms of this country.
Legally. Right, legally.
Absolutely. There are a host of issues about which there's some curiosity about where you really stand, so-called wedge issues, social issues. I'd like to go through just four of them very quickly.
OK.
Let's start with "Obamacare." Repeal it, mend it...
Totally.
... fix it.
Right. Totally -- no, no, repeal it, replace it with something much better. There are so many ideas that are so much better. You know, "Obamacare" is going to be the death of the country. That's another one, it's going to cost so much.
Right.
The problem is, I will not be able at all to get over the issue of Planned Parenthood as long as they're providing abortions. And that's what they're doing. And they're doing it pretty readily, and it's not good. So I would absolutely defund. They have to get over that issue. That's a big problem for me.
And the Second Amendment, gun control.
Totally in favor of Second Amendment. I am a big Second Amendment person. And I've gotten great marks. You know, my sons are -- and so am I -- are members of the NRA. But my sons have been there for years, and they're great shots, great marksmen and big believers. But I'm a big believer in the Second Amendment.
Well, Donald Trump, it's always good to talk with you, and I appreciate your time. Come back soon as we try to better understand your policies and positions. We enjoyed talking with you. I hope the same can be said from your side.
Well, I love your show and I watch it all the time, and I appreciate it, Lou. And I also know that you've been very nice to me, and even if I'm wrong on something, you've been nice. That's even better, right?
That's why -- I'm the nicest guy you're going to see on television. It's incredible.
Well, you're a great guy, actually. And I appreciate it very much, Lou.
I think that's his -- the super PAC supporting him.
Yes, they have been indicted, so he's a mess, there's no question about it.
Mr. Trump, I'm being told that you have to go. I appreciate your calling in and taking my questions, as always, sir. Thank you.
Well, thank you very much, Jake. And thank John.
OK. Will do.
Thank you.
Give me an idea of what a Trump cabinet, a Trump White House would look like, maybe a VP choice, secretary of defense, Secretary of State. Give me some ideas, names you like.
Look, I don't want to use names. I could say a Jack Welch, who'd be great. I could say, you know, Carl and Carl types. You have Henry Kravises. Warren Buffett said the nicest things about me the other day. I have great respect for Warren Buffett. But he said, Trump is here to stay. I was impressed, because I think he's supporting perhaps Hillary or something.
Sure.
But -- but you know, Warren Buffett is a -- a terrific guy, and -- and you know, and a very common sense person. I mean, Warren is a very common sense...
And you'd listen to them.
I would.
We already owe them a boatload of money.
Here's the beauty. They take our jobs, they take our money, and we owe them $1.4 trillion. How do you figure that one? That's like a magic act.
That's scary. Let me go to specifics on the economy. You want to lower the tax. You want to implement a flat tax.
No, no.
You don't? I thought you liked the flat tax. I read it in a couple interviews.
The problem with the flat tax is it's sort of the same. I actually believe that people, as they make more and more money, can pay a higher percentage, OK?
How high?
To be honest.
OK, do you believe in supply side economics inasmuch as you reduce taxes on everybody, including the wealthy, and that a rising tide lifts all boats? Are you -- do you...
I don't fully believe it, but there is something to it. I don't fully. You know, I've studied it...
But you don't want a flat tax. You've said that.
I don't like where everybody is paying the same.
Well, a fair tax, a consumption tax is...
Look, we have a system now. It's -- it's morphed into something that's become -- you have to be a nuclear physicist from Iran...
... that guy
Yes, you could be him. He would -- he's not smart enough to figure it out.
The biggest accounting companies can't come to the same tax debt that somebody owes when you give them the same information.
I'm talking about -- the word is simplification. We can simplify. We can get rid of deductions, which is in some cases -- and lower the taxes.
That would help the economy dramatically, in my opinion.
Immediately.
They're about to get $150 billion.
What we're giving them -- we're giving them $150 billion, plus tremendous other things that we're giving them. And you know the saddest part? Even if the deal isn't approved, we now agreed to give more money.
You actually said, They, meaning Iran, will do what I tell them to do.
They'll do what I tell them to do.
How would you deal with that?
You have to stop the money at the banking sources. We have to stop the money at the banking sources.
Go back to ISIS.
It's hard to believe.
You talked about taking their oil, surrounding, a perimeter.
Correct.
... of the military.
Correct! We lost thousands of people...
Five thousand.
... you know, in Iraq. Well, and we have people walking around without an arm, without a leg, and worse than that.
Give them the money.
Give them millions! And by the way, that's peanuts compared to what you're talking about in terms of money.
All right, is that enough...
Give them a lot of money and keep a lot of money.
I don't see a scenario under which the Israelis, probably joining with the Saudis, Egyptians, Jordanians, don't take out those sites before they get them.
Well...
And the United States -- I see that happening.
I mean, we're in trouble, but Israel would be in very big trouble if this deal is allowed to go forward. What I hate so much about the deal -- the 24 days is ridiculous.
Nuts. Yes.
But you know, before you get to the 24 days, there's a whole process -- I don't know if you know that...
It's crazy.
You know, we're not sending a rocket to the moon. But why didn't we say, Fellows, we want the prisoners.
$150 billion is the equivalent of $8 trillion USA dollars based on the size of their economy.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Let me ask you a couple more things. You wrote "The Art of the Deal, " best-selling book. Are you learning that the art of politics is different than the art of the deal?
Well, I mean, so far, I'm enjoying politics, and I guess I'm enjoying because, I mean, a poll just came in where I'm 32, at 32 percent.
ISIS has them.
One shot is fired, our allies run. ISIS now has 2,300. Do you know how many that is? I thought they were wrong. I thought I -- when I read it, I thought they maybe made -- it's a typographical, like, 23, so -- and by the way, we don't have the quality Humvees. So now they have better machinery than we. Our guys are driving around, they don't even have protection underneath. That's why they're losing their legs and their arms.
And you wouldn't cut Social Security?
We have to take care of the women, with the women's issues.
67 million Americans out of the labor force. You wouldn't -- - you wouldn't raise the retirement age or...
No, I wouldn't.
A lot has been made over your Twitter account. If you won the presidency, would you still stay on Twitter? Would you be out there at 1:00 o'clock in the morning tweeting?
Well, probably a little bit less. But I'll tell you, it's pretty amazing.
You'd still do it?
I do get my point across.
You do.
You know, it's funny. For years, if somebody did bad stuff to me, I couldn't fight back. Now I have @realdonaldtrump, and I can sort of tweet some bad stuff about them...
Real quick.
... and if people like it, it's all over the world.
Who are the people you listen to the most as it relates to politics? Who do you -- who -- who can come into your office and say, I don't like this?
You know, I listen to your show. I listen to other shows. I see some very smart guys on the shows. I like Bolton. I like a lot of the guys that you have and that, frankly, I see on other networks. I mean, I respect them, even if they're not necessarily...
... close to you that really -- that you count on the most?
Well, I have some very smart people in my organization, and my children are very smart. You know, and you know Ivanka, how smart, and she's got a great sensibility...
I know Eric. I know Donald, Jr.
I'll tell you what. Ivanka came to me the other day. It was very interesting. And you know, with this whole thing with Megyn Kelly, and it's really -- in theory, it's not a big deal...
Mr. Trump, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Appreciate you being with us.
Great honor.
Joining us now from his headquarters here in New York City is Mr. Trump. So, the journal says, you are killing the Republican Party over immigration. And you say?
We have to bring our country back, Bill. We are in big trouble. We are losing so much, we're losing so much to sell many and we have to bring our country back. We have at least 11 million illegals in the country not only the jobs they are taking but everything else. And you know about the crime wave because I think probably nobody has covered the crime wave better than you. There is a literal crime wave going on. You know, and if you look, we have spent last year $113 billion on illegal immigrants. We have to do something about it and we have to start by building a wall, a big beautiful powerful wall. It can have a gate. It can have a door. We'll let people in illegally but we have to stop what is happening to our country because we're losing our country.
OK. Now, I want to advance the dialogue here. The strongest part of your immigration plan in my opinion is the wall. I think it is a doable thing. Rudy Giuliani came in here and you can do it. And that would cut down a lot of the illegal immigration and not only that, the drug trafficking which is out of control. So, I support the wall. But then you say, well, we have to have mass deportations, that is not going to happen because the 14th Amendment says if you are born here you are an American and you can't kick Americans out. And then if you want to deport the people already here, each and every one are entitled to due process and it would take decades to do that and gazillions of dollars and the courts would block you at every turn. You must know all that.
Bill, I think you are wrong about the 14th amendment and frankly the whole thing with anchor babies and the concept of anchor babies I don't think you are right about that.
I can quote it. You want me to quote you the amendment? If you are born here you are an American, period, period.
But there are many lawyers -- many lawyers are saying that's not the way it is in terms of this. What happens is they are in Mexico, they are going to have a baby, they move over here and a couple of days they have the baby. No, but Bill, they are saying it is not going to hold up in court. Now it's going to have to be tested but they say it's not going to hold up in court. Regardless, when people are illegally in the country they have to go. Now, the good ones and there are plenty of good ones, will work so it is expedited, we can expedite it where they come back in but they come back legally. Bill, we have a country. You need borders and you need laws. We have no law.
I have been saying that for decades I've been saying that. But you are not going to be able to deport people who have American citizenship now and the federal courts will never allow mass deportations without due process for each and every one. And do you envision federal police kicking in the doors in barrios around the country dragging families out and putting them on a bus? Do you envision that?
Bill, I don't think they have American citizenship. And if you speak to some very, very good lawyers. And I know some would disagree. But many of them agree with me, you will going to find, they do not have American citizenship. We have to start a process where we take back our country. Our country is going to hell. We have to start a process Bill where we take back our country.
Now, there is a way to do it and that is to try to get the constitution amended. Do you know how to do that?
It's a long process and I think it would take too long. I would much rather find out whether or not anchor babies are actually citizens.
All right. You can test, why don't you test it out? Why don't you have your guys file a federal suit now?
We'll going to test it out.
You can do it tomorrow.
We'll going to test it out. That's going to happen, Bill.
Now, the "Wall Street Journal" basically says, look, in the fields of California, there are food rotting because we can't get Americans to go in at $17 an hour plus benefits by the way, and pick the fruit and pick the vegetables in California. So, you need the illegal labor in there. I don't think you need illegal labor. I think you need legal labor. And I would make it much more, much easier to get legal people in here to do that work if they want it.
I agree with that. I agree with that.
OK. You agree. Good. I'm good.
Absolutely.
Now, the journal also says that Hispanic-Americans are going to turn away from the Republican Party in droves because of you even if you don't win, they're going to hate the Republican Party. What do you say to that?
So, in Nevada, they just did a poll, I am leading in every state virtually every state that they polled. And in Nevada, they just did a major poll where I am not only leading by big numbers but I also won the Hispanic vote. And I have been saying, I'm going to win the Hispanic vote. And the reason I'm going to is, I am going to bring jobs back. I'm going to bring jobs back from China, from Japan, from all of these places including Mexico by the way which is really taking advantage of the United States both on the border and from the standpoint of trade. So, I will be bringing jobs back, Bill. Nobody else can do it like me. In fact, in the same poll they had me blowing away the competition when it comes to the economy which is a very big factor.
OK. Now, you in order to be president are going to have to win over a sizable amount of the so-called independent voters, not registered Republicans. OK. You know that, right? Because all the polls based on republican-leaning voters and now you will have to go out. All right? Are you going to modify it a little bit? Are you going to go out with the scorch and burn tactics you've used so far?
Well, if you look what happened last time with Romney, I mean, they say he didn't do well with the Hispanics. But the truth is, he didn't do well with the Republicans. They sat home and they didn't go out and vote. They had no incentive to vote. If you look at the polls that are coming out on me, they have a great incentive to vote. They like what I say. I think they like me in a certain way which is nice. It is always nice to be liked. But they have a great incentive to come out and vote for me because we are going to make America great again. Romney never said that and unfortunately tremendous, millions and millions of people sat home Bill, and didn't vote. They will come out and vote.
Three million. Three million.
We are going to energize the base.
All right.
That would have been a big difference.
Fair interview tonight? Fair?
Say it again.
Was this fair? This interview, fair?
You're always fair.
All right. So, you are not going to whine about FOX News now? I'm not going to get, you know, O'Reilly this, you're not going to do that, right?
I promise. I think you are terrific. I watch you all the time and I think you're fair tonight.
Don't think I'm terrific. Don't think I'm terrific. That's not good for me. All right? And I'm worried if you are president and I will get deported. All right? That's what I'm worried about.
Well, we will going to try like hell to keep you here, Bill.
All right.
You have always been fair and I appreciate it. Thank you.
So we have the polls in politics, we have policy and we have the personal. They're all Ps and we'll jump around as seems right to you.
OK. That's fine.
Well, the factual distinction would be that that was classified information with Petraeus. And he knew it and he used it. Here, we do not know yet that...
Wait...
... Hillary Clinton was doing the wrong thing or mishandling classified information...
But it looks like it was...
... does that matter?
... and it certainly looks like it was very high level information. And what's the purpose of it? You know, it's always scouting the edge, what's the purpose of it? In the end, she had something in mind. She didn't want the people to know or something, but what is she doing? Why is she doing it?
You think this is really going to hurt her long-time?
I think it's devastating. I think it's devastating for the election but I think her bigger problem is not the election. I think her bigger problem is going to be the criminal problem.
Really? You really think that this could turn out to be a criminal situation for Hillary Clinton...
Well...
... because there's no reference of that from the investigators right now.
... I don't think I'm the only one. I mean the FBI's involved. They only do criminal. I don't think I'm the only one. Now, maybe it's somebody in her staff but look, it's either criminal or incompetence. Just one or the other. You see the gross incompetence or criminal. And neither is acceptable to be president.
When you think about ISIS and what you do to stop them, how much of it for you is about the military? How much of it for you is about doing other things -- political things to strengthen the regions that they are preying upon?
Well, I think a lot of it is about the military. And I think one of the things I noticed in your poll, I came out way, way ahead of everybody on the economy and a lot of people weren't surprised to see that. But I also came way out ahead on the military. And...
How do you keep them?
You keep them by...
And they say the labors cheaper over there.
... and you know what, we'll say, "That's fine the labors cheaper over there that's good but, you know what, you're going to have to pay a tax to get the cars back in. You got to have to pay a penalty." And if you a penalty on it, a tariff, or whatever you call it. And believe me, China's doing it to us. China dumps all their stuff -- and I'm not complaining about that but you -- I have friends in the manufactures, they cannot get their product into China. So if they're going to do it to us, we have to do it to them.
And they'll say, "But then, my cars are going to cost more for your people."
No, you know what? They're going to make cars here and maybe a person will buy fewer cars over a course of a lifetime. Who cares? We have to have? We have to bring back our jobs, Chris. We have to do it. We have no choice.
I hear you but of course here comes how. You know, on this scenario, you just have Ford saying it's cheaper over there. You're going to punish the consumer.
I will tell you. You're not punishing the consumer and you're strengthening our country. We have $18 trillion. It's going to be -- very soon it's going to be $20 trillion that we owe.
All right. Let me go back...
And interestingly, Carl Icahn agrees with me. And Carl Icahn, you know, is a great negotiator and I have many other great negotiators and they are dying to get involved.
But you wouldn't really put him in-charge of China?
I would absolutely.
In-charge of China?
Can I tell you what...
Please, because you know what makes people think -- it's like...
... in-charge of China.
... this is not a business, it's a whole political governmental thing.
No, no, no. It's a business too. Hey, you can come up with me in this building you'll see the largest bank in the world from China is in this -- I have a great relationship with China just like I do with Mexico.
Right. But don't we need diplomacy in all of the policy...
No. We have diplomacy now. They're killing us and they don't even like us. So we have diplomacy. So we're diplomatic. They don't like us and they're beating us. With me, they'll like us and we'll beat them. OK?
DO you think he'll take a job like that?
He'll do it in two seconds. He's already told me he'd love to do it.
To oversee China?
Oversee the trade deal.
The trade deal?
Oversee the trade deals in China.
Sure.
And you know, the ambassador to Japan has a big role in trade.
Because they're cheaper.
Wait a minute. They're pouring off the ships, you know, we send them? Beef. And they don't want it because they say, "We don't want it." And we send them wheat, they don't want it. And you know, what the imbalance is between these over the years millions of cars and the little stuff we send them? It's massive. We've got to equalize it.
We Trump. We're Mexican-American.
To win the Latino -- we're going to win the Hispanic, right?
So, you said something earlier about the poll that you came out ahead on ISIS that was a surprise to people. One of the reasons...
But not to me because I talked about it a lot.
I understand. But one of the reasons that might have been surprising is something else you said which is that you get a lot of your military analysis from watching television. That...
See I didn't exactly say that. I watch your show. And I watch other shows. And you have the best channels, the best everything...
But you need a team, aren't you?
And I read magazines specially Time Magazine this week because I'm on the cover. OK. So I specially will look at it. But I read magazines and I read other things. Yeah, sure I need a team but, you know, by the time you get to a problem, you know, we're talking a long ways away, it's going to be changed. You can have a whole different set of -- I mean different countries will be run by different people in all fairness. So when I watch...
So you're saying they respect you?
So I need -- I think they do. I mean I think, well, I got the award from them and they presented it to me so I think they do. But when I say that, a lot of people thought I was very smart, you know, I watched all of the shows, you get the best people, you know, because even the generals want to be on television, right or their retired generals in many cases but I see a lot of good things by watching your show and other shows. And it's really nothing that we left that or scoff that...
Today?
And some people agree with me on ISIS. Many of them agree with me on ISIS.
You don't think we are considered the strongest country in world militarily?
I think we are considered to be a country in decline -- serious decline. You look at our education, we're number 25 in the world and we spend far more than anybody else per student.
Would you let women fight in the military, in a rangers and all the elite troops?
Yeah, I guess the answer is yes because they are really into it and some of them are really, really good.
You just said, to graduate from the ranger school?
Yeah, I would also speak to the generals because I would want to hear that without a political bent. I want to hear the truth. I mean, you know, to the public they say, "Yes, yes, yes, " but I would want to hear without a political bent. But I tell you what, I know some women that are just -- Ronda Rousey is an example who likes me said...
Lucky for you.
... I'd take care -- hey, I'd take care at my side as fighter. So the answer is yes. I would also want to speak however to the military.
So you come on last week and you say, "I don't have to talk about what I do with women. I can show what I do with women. We hire them. We put them in positions of excellence and we pay them all from better than a male counter parts if they are work warranted."
Better.
So your office then comes, they provide us what they call their proof of performance, hear the jobs it happens, it's a private company. We don't want to out the people, you'll say if I want to come in there?
Although, they would be willing to do it.
That's right. I'll sign an NDA, a nondisclosure bill. So that goes out, you issue the challenge to other candidates, the media kind of dismisses it?
Yeah.
Your people in the GOP worried that you are going to alienate excuse the pun, the Hispanic population when you have 28 million.
Because I have to do the right thing.
We have 28 million voters...
You're right.
You definitely change the nature of the dialogue, I'll give you that and I certainly never. We try to take here out of context, to try to take at your words and put it in context.
I know, what I'm saying many people did...
Are you say -- would you then go...
At some point all we have to -- look at some point we have to be honest with ourselves. It's cause, you know, they now they like to use the word undocumented because it's more political. I don't use that word. Here, illegal immigrants, they came over illegally. Some are wonderful people and they have been here for a while they got to go out.
But how you do it in a practical way? You really think you go around the and eliminate people?
Well, you know what? At some point we're going to try getting a back -- the good ones. We have a lot good ones here, same time...
You're sending a mixed message though Mr. Trump because you say you're going to get rid the whole families but then you say you want to back...
You're going to do it, they're illegal. We have a country. We have to have a border. We have to build a wall. Mexico will pay for the wall. I got to kick out this guys that never negotiated, they can't negotiate for their own house.
So the citizenship for those babies, you would revoke it, now in retroactively?
Number one the 14th amendment is very questionable as to whether or not somebody can come over and have a baby and immediately that baby is a citizen.
I know. The court has pretty much said and agreed that immigrants here, this isn't a minority legal opinion you are talking about.
Chris, there are many people that totally feel that...
They may have want it that way.
... amending is too big of deal it's going to be take -- it will be two terms, I'd be in my second term on my 8th year by the time assuming everything went smoothly because to amend the constitution...
Takes a long time.
... I believe...
Especially on a very divisive issue.
... I believe you can win it legally OK? I believe you can win it legally. And in any event the parents have to leave, if the parents leave unless they are very bad people they got to take it their baby.
75 percent of the country feels that you should be trying to find the way to let people stay with conditions as supposed to kicking everybody else.
This people, the really good ones and we have some great ones, what they are trying expedite so they can come back but they going to come back legally. Let me tell you, when you look at Baltimore, when you look at Chicago, when you look at the crime that's going on, you have some of this people are illegal immigrants, I mean they're illegal they keep coming to the country, they're gang members, they're the toughest of the group they're tough...
So bad but, you know, most of them came here...
... don't came here I get them out...
I think it's going to be low in the list.
If -- but that's one on the things I can't environmental permits, can you believe this OK, believe me that's will I do as I get permits.
What about going after the employers, now this isn't a cheap thing to come at you and say you are one of them?
That's true.
But you have this employers...
Well, you know, what have they check all my buildings and so far with all of the jobs I have Washington, everyone nobody's found one...
Well, good for you.
Are you impressed?
Good for you, I was impressed the moment you sat down. What I'm saying is you have this employers the agro-companies, the other big manufactures, they take him because its cheap labor, and they get away with it all the time you never hear about a big case of them getting busted unless...
Yeah.
... you know, something happens and it goes away, why does anybody make amendment part of the solution?
First of all we do have people that can do those jobs and their unemployed now in this country, second of all those good people that have been working with U.S., I wanted to come back in, I wanted him to go out but I want him to come back in legally, so they can come back and they can work for those companies, I do want them to come back...
But do you go after the employers and do it on wrong way?
... well one way you find out who they are is through the employers, absolutely.
All right. So let me ask you about the pope, the pope's coming, do you want to meet him?
Well I'm Protestant, but I have great respect for the pope, I like the pope I actually like him his becoming very political there's not question about it, but I like him he seems like a pretty good guy.
So here's the moment you meet the pope, Pope Francis comes.
Right.
There's a translator there...
Right.
... you scare the pope.
... I -- I no, no I do not have to scare the pope because it's, you know, they there's only one, look the pope -- I hope can only be scared by God...
The capitalism hasn't?
It has not been working properly.
But do you think about, "Man, this is going to be a lot on them."
It's a tough -- I sat down with them, I told them I said, "You know, I don't know this is months ago, and, you know...
But now you're in a very good for place.
... my -- and my wife said something very interesting, she's my pollster, OK. She said, "You know, if you actually announce you're going to win, I said what? She said I see the reaction...
But what do you -- do you think about that to like -- you said your wife is she going to campaign for you, is she...
Yes.
... ready to be first lady?
Sure.
She's been quiet on this so far...
She has been and purposely and, and, you know, I haven't asked her to do anything and she would certainly like to -- Ivanka, you know, very well a lot of respect for you...
Ivanka should be president.
... she's got a lot -- she could be president and she be great. She got a lot of respect to you, she had a lot of respect to your brother, tremendous respect to your brother...
Well, you think you'll put Melania out there, you put your kids out there?
...boys will campaign. They want to be out there. They believe in what I'm saying, and I will say, from women's health issues standpoint, Melania is unbelievable.
She would want to own something like that?
And Ivanka. I think she want to be involved and that she feels very strongly, very fit. That's why when she saw Bush the other day knocking it, it really bothered her that could happen.
One of the time about her when you married her, everybody says the marriage is great, your testament, you know, one of the marriages seems to be working this days. When you got marriage, she became a citizen, she was work legally?
Right.
I know, you have a big appearance to get to New Hampshire get to about that problem. Thank you for taking a time, you're always welcome...
Thank you very much.
... to be talking about what matters.
Great honor, thank you.
Did you just say -- Wait. Wait. Did you just say that was not good?
You're saying such nice things this morning that I hate to break it up. I'd rather just listen.
Yeah -- Jon Meachum --
But it is a compliment.
Let me ask you a question, Donald. It's strange, you actually have liberals and libertarians coming together over criminal justice reform. A lot of people on the right and left think it doesn't make sense that we have so many nonviolent offenders in prison and we spend $80 billion a year just incarcerating Americans. We spend four time the amount keeping people in jail than we do on educating Americans. Have you been following the talk about criminal justice reform?
I have.
Do you think we need to stop putting so many nonviolent offenders in jail and paying $80 billion a year?
Well, I have to say this, in terms of our cities and in terms of the violent offenses, we have to get a lot tougher. Because if you look at what's going on with Baltimore and with places like Chicago where we have great people -- You know, I know the chief of police said these are fantastic people, they have to be able to do their job and if they do their job, if they're allowed to do their job the way they know how to do it, they'll stop the onslaught of crime that we have in this country --
Right. So that's for violent offenders. What about nonviolent crimes? What about marijuana? Should a kid be thrown in jail because he gets busted for marijuana?
I don't really think so and I think that maybe the dealers have to be looked at very strongly. But then you have states all of a sudden legalizing it. So it's sort of hard to say that you're on one side of the border and you go to jail and you're on the other side and you can go into a store and buy it. So there is going to be changes made there, Joe. There has to be. But you just can't. So when you mention the marijuana, that is a very tough subject nowadays, especially since it's been legalized and it will continue to be legalized.
Yes, I am.
And I looked at my watch and I said, you know, it's 7:00 in the morning, I got back late last night, and I said I hope instead she'll ask me what happened in Mobile where hopefully your brother will be there, Joe.
My brother will be there. Listen, Donald, you know Mika and I know Mika, she has got to ask the question and then you do with it whatever you want and then we'll talk about Mobile, Alabama.
All right. Go ahead, Mika. Let me have it.
Glad you asked that question.
Women should have absolute access to capital, Mika. When it comes to categorizing people, men and women into a group, it gets to be very dangerous. When you have to categorize men and women into a particular group and a particular pay scale, it gets very -- because people do different jobs. If they do the same job, they should get the same pay. But it's very hard to say what is the same job. It's a very, very tricky question. And I talked about competition with other places and other parts of the world, Mika. This is one of the things that we have to look at very strongly.
Who would you pay more here, Donald? Just curious.
With you or Joe, I would absolutely pay you more.
All right.
I would pay you much more. Joe, I would pay Mika so much more your head would spin. Mika, I heard you talking about Mobile. So what happened, Mobile, Alabama, is amazing. We took a barroom, we had 500 people, we thought, and they called and said we're being swamped. Then we took a room for 1500 people. And they call and they said we're swamped. Then they took the convention center and now I understand they're going to have, like, 30 or 40 or something thousand people. They ended up taking the football stadium. So it's going to be an amazing Friday and if your brother is around there, Joe, I have to meet him because you've been saying such great things about your brother. He must be a brilliant guy.
Now that you've been going around for awhile, what surprised you the most about being a candidate as opposed to being a -- someone who is flirting with the idea?
Well, I've had a lot of pleasant surprises, Jon. I've met great people. I've met tremendous enthusiasm. You know, people really want to see it. My theme is "make America great again." I've even copyrighted it. Can you believe it? Nobody else can use it. At the beginning, they started using it and I said you can't use it, it's copyright. I can't believe I got the copyright on that one but I guess I have a good lawyer. That's what I do.
That's a lot of billable hours.
You know what? I've gained a lot of respect for some members of the press. I've seen a lot of, you know, I've seen a lot of dishonesty with the press. But I've also met some amazing people in the press that really are great political reporters and I'm a little bit surprised at that aspect of it. I'm not surprised that I've met some -- I've met some people that write really falsely, you know, where something will be written that just didn't take place and I'm sort of amazed. Even at an event. But I've met some amazing people in the press, in the political press, that I'm very impressed with.
And still is.
Well, Joe, you have a great example in your studio. John Heilemann, I couldn't stand this guy, right? I could not stand him. What happened is through his cohort mark, I met John and I liked him a lot. And they did an interview. And I actually really like him a lot.
Well, you might want to rethink that.
So it means I have a short memory. Hey John, who would have thought I would have liked you, right?
It's inconceivable.
So, you know, I mean, I do like him and I respect him. You know, you do have to have a short memory because a lot of times you'll -- I mean, you meet so many people. You just have to be able to forget it. And I think I'm able to do that generally. Sometimes I'm not. I will say. But generally speaking, I think I'm able to do that.
Look at Bob McDonald in Virginia. Didn't violate a state law. The Justice Department decides to go after him and puts him in jail for five, six, seven, eight years.
Very sad.
My brother will be seeing you there.
Thank you very much. I look forward it to, Joe.
Thank you, Donald.
Thank you, Mika.
Yes.
And then the amazing thing is we owe China right now $1.4 trillion. You know they do this and -- by the way, the same amount we owe Japan 1$.4 trillion. So it's like a magic act to them. They take everything and then we owe them money.
Unbelievable. Well --
They couldn't get an environmental impact statement completed to get the wall built.
That's a whole 'nother conversation.
That's a whole 'nother conversation.
Yes, she was very flippant about it, too. You know, she made a joke about Snapchat, and she's got a Snapchat account that deletes --
Yes, she should not have made that joke, because that's sort of throwing in it their face. She should not have made that joke, but, you know, we will have to see. A lot of people are watching to see what they do.
Let me ask you about some of the issues that are important to the American people, Donald, and that is wages and tax reform. What's your plan for tax reform.
Well, we have to simplify because -- you know, I have a little cute statement. "I want H&R Block out of business." And it's so complicated, people that are making $50,000 a year, $60,000 dollars a year, they have go and pay a lot of money to tax, you know, these firms that do this stuff. It's ridiculous. We have to, at a minimum, we have to simplify. And I'm going to be coming out over the next four weeks with a I think a really comprehensive, like I did on immigration -- I'm very proud of that because now everybody is taking about immigration and illegal immigration. And if I wasn't involved, Maria, you know, they wouldn't be talking about it. They wouldn't -- I don't think immigration would even come up as a presidential point to be discussed.
Well --
I think that what I'm going to be doing with taxes will be similar, maybe less dramatic actually. But similar. We have to simplify our system. At a minimum we have to simplify our system and I would like to see a reduction in taxes. And we have to simplify our taxes.
Reduction in corporate taxes or all taxes, what?
Oh absolutely -- a reduction in all taxes but especially corporate and especially for the middle class. I mean, what we are doing to our middle class is inconceivable. It's terrible. You know, this country was sort of built by the middle class, it is one of those facts of life, and we are really treating them badly and they're disappearing, so we've got to take care of them.
So you mean a foreign company acquiring an American company just to improve their tax story?
Not even that. An American company buying a foreign company and then moving.
So how are you going to balance this? Because you are saying a lot of things here. I mean, on one hand, you know, you want to make sure that we've got trade deals in place, you want to do trade -- better deals with Japan, better deals with China. And at the same time, you're saying you don't want any illegals here and it sounds a little protectionist. Do you find that you're a protectionist?
No, I'm not. I'm a free trader, but the problem with free traders is you need smart leaders and we don't have smart leaders. You need great negotiators and we don't have great negotiators. We're not using our great negotiators; we're using diplomats, we're political hacks. We're using people to negotiating with China, and Japan, and we're using -- and the, by the way, I use them as examples, but we don't make good deals with anybody. Every country that does business with us walks away laughing.
Let me ask you about this space story. President Obama has been setting his sights on Mars, spending money to get U.S. there. But we have the Chinese trying to target our satellites in space, namely our military satellites. What would Trump space program look like?
Well, I wouldn't be thinking about Mars. I'd be thinking about getting our country fixed first, OK? Before we worry about Mars, I'd be thinking about our infrastructure, our bridges that are falling down, our airports that are third world. You go to some of these places -- like you go to Qatar and you go to any -- I mean, so many places in China --
Singapore. Singapore's gorgeous, the airport.
Singapore. You look at their airports and their highways and their roads, and their everything, their infrastructure, and then you come back at home and you land at LaGuardia, you land at JFK, you land at LAX or Newark, and it's third world airports. It's so sad what has happened to our country.
Right, that's absolutely right. But where does the money come from, Donald, to pay for it? You're saying all, you know, very important things, in terms of infrastructure in this country, but will you have to raise taxes to get there?
No, it comes from cutting costs. We are tremendously bloated. It comes from cutting costs and it comes from bringing back jobs from these other places. And it comes from fairness. You know, China devalued, as you know, because you covered it very big a few days ago, China devalued, the biggest in two decades. Nobody thought they'd do that again. They have been devaluing their currency now and they're making it impossible for our companies to compete. We can't allow this to happen. So we -- and as you know, we can do things. We have tremend -- we have so many cards over China.. People say, oh well, they have the power over us. It's really wrong. We have the power. We have rebuilt China. If you think about it, the money they have taken out from our country, alone. Now they have done it in a smaller way to Europe and other places, but they've taken out of the United States, we've rebuilt China.
What do you do though? Do you want to rein it in?
Well, maybe they're going to have to. Look, we're going to lose a lot of business with it. You know, the strong dollar sounds good. It sounds good to say we have a strong dollar.
That's what they always say, but they don't do it.
That's about where it stops, because, you know, if you look at it, you can say we have a strong dollar, we have a strong currency, and there are certain advantages to that, but there are certain huge disadvantages. And the disadvantage is our companies are really suffering. It's very hard for Caterpillar and a lot of these other companies -- look at their stock. I saw their stock the other day, it's bad. It's very hard for these companies to compete when you have, you know, China, Japan, knocking the hell out of their currency. It's very hard.
So as the leader the free world, what do you do about it, Donald?
You have to have respect. You have to have them not do that. And if they do that, you're going to have to put a tariff on their goods coming in to equalize it.
OK, so you're talking about tariffs. You're talking about --
You have no other choice. Well, you have no other choice. I don't want tariffs. Hey look, let's face it. China does tariffs on us like crazy. I have neater friend who's a manufacturer. He can't get goods into China. And when he does -- and he's a really good manufacturer, really good. When he does get them in they charge him a tariff and it's a massive -- he gave me a number which I won't even say because I can't even believe it. But they charge him massive tariffs to get his stuff into China. They've put their stuff in and we don't charge anything. So for people who think there's free trade, free trade is only good when you have smart people on your side.
What would you do in terms of all of your wealth? I mean, in terms of avoiding any conflict. Would you put it in a blind trust? How would you deal with that?
Well, I'd do whatever you're supposed to do. I guess I would put it in a trust or a blind trust, and you know Ivanka and my boys, and I have a lot of great executives. They'd run the company. The company is -- you know, you saw the numbers. I mean, the company is a great company. It's very liquid. We have very little debt. We have tremendous cash flow, and it's a great company. I tell them don't do deals. Just don't do anything. Just relax and run it properly. You know, it's a big company and I'd want them to run it properly.
Well, let me get your one word sentence describing your opinions on each of these leaders. I'd love to get you to sort of respond to some -- your quick thoughts on somebody like Angela Merkel.
Fantastic leader. She's -- I was with somebody the other day who thinks she is greatest leader in the world today. She's the most -- she's the smartest and the greatest leader in the world today, and this is a person that has great knowledge of her and deals with her.
David Cameron.
Um, good. Fought back a tremendous threat because that would have been the whole Scotland situation I think good. I deal with him a little bit. I think very good. I think he's becoming better with time, actually.
How about Vladimir Putin?
Uh, I actually think that he is somebody that can be dealt with. I think his dislike of President Obama is so intense that it really has affected the whole relationship. We've driven them into the arms of China, so that now these two are together, which is also a been the great sin. Don't ever let Russia and China get together. We've driven them together. I think he is somebody that I would have a very decent relationship with if I ever win.
How about Xi in China?
Always smart. Chinese leaders are -- they have a different system than ours. They don't do it by television, they do it by a different route to get up there. Always smart and certainly he's been very smart. I think what he did with the recent devaluations, which a lot of people said were market driven, they are not market driven. They did it to keep it going. But the -- the leaders in China always turn out to be smart, and he's certainly one of them.
So what do you do? I mean, what's the answer --
You need spirit, you need the right attitude, but you also need jobs. You have to bring back jobs and you have to get them back quickly.
How do you find those people? I mean --
I know those people.
Government jobs, people don't want those jobs. How are you going to get the smartest people?
I know those people, Maria. I know those people and you know those people, and -- I know people that are better than the people that are on your show. Better. But you've never heard of them.
Let me get your take. You mentioned Charlie Gasparino earlier. You know, yesterday he reported that right after Labor Day, the GOP contenders are going to do a big attack against you --
I heard that.
And -- How are you going to fight back?
Well, first of all, I am a fan of Charlie and he is only a modest fan of me. I was surprised -- I thought he was a huge Trump fan. He's only a modest Trump fan and I was surprised because I'm a big fan -- Is that Charlie in the background?
I think you're a great businessman.
Well, I love you. So far I am a good politician, too, Charlie, because I am leading in every poll. So I am going to get you to change your mind, OK?
All right.
But, anyway.
All right. I can be convinced.
But I do have great respect for Charlie and I like him, so -- I heard that, actually yesterday from Charlie, OK, and I know nothing about it other than what he says. In fact, I had mentioned it to somebody that I'm hearing they are going to attack me, they said where did you get it, I said I got it from Charlie. So I don't know, I hope he is wrong and if he's wrong, that's good and if he's right, I think I will survive.
Donald, the fundraisers are saying that, the campaigns now are so scared of you, they're coming out no, no, we are not going after Donald.
Well, Charlie, they are getting killed. I mean, they are getting killed. The new polls -- I mean, they're getting killed. These are professional politicians but they don't have energy, they don't have life, and you know, one thing we know -- this -- we're doing badly, as a country, and one thing --
Are you worried about Joe Biden coming in?
Wait a minute. One thing we know, Maria, for sure, we need somebody with energy, and these people don't have -- I mean, they don't have energy. We need smarts, we need everything. But you also have to have energy. When you look at Jeb and you look at some of these people, they don't have the energy that you see from some of our business leaders. You just don't see it.
How about Joe Biden? The word is he's --
Well, maybe he comes in, I really don't know, I really don't care if he comes in, personally. I think Hillary is in trouble. I think she could be in big trouble. We will see what happens. Charlie would actually have a good bent on that, I would imagine. But I think she could be in very big trouble. I think Biden might come in at some point.
Let me get your take on some off-topic headlines. Some of the lighter stuff. Tom Brady, is he getting a raw deal from the NFL commissioner Roger Goodell? What do you think?
I think it's ridiculous the way they've treated him. He's a friend of mine, he's a great friend of mine. He's a great guy. I think it is terrible the way they've treated him. They've got -- you know, to go -- to spend 10 million dollars in legal fees, and now it's probably much higher than that, it is crazy what they are doing. He's their great star, let -- They ought to go back to play football. This country has bigger problems.
What about your players? Who are you taking first in your fantasy football draft?
As far as I'm concerned, you just mentioned one of the guys. I mean, Tom Brady is just a great guy and I always take Tom Brady. I have taken him for years, and if you have done some friendly bets on Tom Brady, you've done very well.
Well, you're --
Actually, I love being a great businessman.
Well, this has to be a total education for you. I mean, I know you've been all around the world and you've done a lot of stuff, Donald, but this is totally different. What has been sort of your big takeaway from this whole running for president?
Well let me just answer Charlie's question because it's sort of -- So what happened, I figured I would have spent 10 million by this point, right?
Right.
I spent nothing!
You spent nothing?
No -- nothing -- Charlie, I've spent zero.
You know what? You are the best politician out there.
I mean zero.
You are the best politicians out there.
No, no, listen -- No, no -- I was going to -- I figured by this point in advertising, which is the biggest expense -- I thought I would have spent 10 million dollars by about this point. But how can you do that if every show, from Fox to CNN to you guys, if every show has everything Trump and then on top of it, they have a Trump commercial, people will get sick. They'll sick.
It's amazing.
So I haven't spent anything. I couldn't. If I did I would be -- they would laugh at me. So, so far I've been saving a lot of money.
How has the GOP been treating you, Donald?
They've be treating me very well. Well, you know, as the frontrunner, they've been treating me very well. And that is why I keep that other door open because if they don't I have that other door open. And not that I want to use it --
When you say I have that other door open, don't you think -- but don't you think running independent would just destroy the opportunity for the Republicans? I mean, are you are willing to do that and then give the election to Hillary --
I think it would -- I think it would be bad, it's something I don't want to do. I'm leading in every poll, I am leading in every state. Florida just came out, I am leading -- it was just reported that in Florida, I am leading Bush by a lot and I'm leading Rubio by a tremendous amount. No, I have a lot of properties in Florida. I own Doral, I own, you know, many, many properties in Florida. I love that state. It's an amazing state. But, you know, when you're leading the two people, you're leading the current senator and the ex governor by a lot, that's sort of nice. But it just came out 10 minutes ago.
Would Rubio be an idea for you as a running mate?
I mean, it could be. Certainly it could be. I like him, he's a nice guy. I have gotten to know him a little bit over the last couple months, you know, I have seen him in the Bedias during the debate. We had really a very good -- We have a good relationship. We'll see what happens. But, of course, he's one of the people that Charlie says is going to spend some negative --
Right, right. Sure. We know that.
Then I go after him. Then I go after him.
What do you mean you want them to --
I will tell you, Maria, Walker was very interesting because he came up to see me like six, seven months ago, before this all started, and gave me a plaque because I supported him a little bit and all that and he gave me a plaque in my office. And he was so nice and then one of his guys said something a little nasty about me. I said, oh, thank goodness, and then I was able to hit him. That is what changed Iowa. You know, once I said that, that's what changed Iowa poll. So, you know, so Kasich has been so nice, and you know, I am really a counter puncher. If you look at what's happened with me and the people that I hit, it is really the people that hit me first. I don't think I hit anybody first.
You never take the first shot.
I never take it. I just -- I can't. Maybe it's my weakness.
You're the Floyd Mayweather.
Yeah, you know what? I think it's my weakness. If they're nice to me, I am never going to say anything bad about a person. It is terrible. I keep hoping for them to hit me, but it's one of those things.
Yeah. We're trying to get you priorities because --
I mean, I know you are going to get great ratings -- but this is getting crazy.
Donald, we appreciate it.
Charlie, I will meet you any time you want.
Thank you, sir.
Look, he was the source of great information. Somebody's going to spend 10 million dollars trying to kill me, OK? So what can I tell you?
Yes, of course.
Charlie is a very trusting person. He trusts nobody. He might trust his mother, but I am not sure about that, Maria. OK?
You guys should have met my mother.
Charlie, would you trust -- would you trust Iran to do their own inspections?
Yes, it absolutely is. Donald, we so appreciate your time this morning. We hope that you come in person next time.
Thank you. I will. I will. And take care of yourselves. You both are terrific.
You keep declaring how you're going to do it...
It's management.
-- but you don't say...
We don't...
-- how.
Excuse me, George?
I still haven't heard the specifics on how you're going to do that, but I'm going to move on...
Well, you'll hear it, George. Don't worry about it.
I'm going to move on right now.
You'll hear it.
Scott Walker...
It's called good management and it's called great people.
Let me ask you...
But I have nothing against Jeb Bush. I think he's a very nice person.
Donald Trump, thanks for your time this morning.
Thank you very much.
... We're really a paper tiger. Let's talk about the campaign. You're new to politics. The truth is you're so on message, you're so into branding your message, "Make America Great Again." Your hats are selling out. You know, where did you learn this discipline?
I guess it's an instinct I have, but the real instinct is I know what it takes to make the country great. And people understand. You know, the public's really smart. They understand it. When the politicians, Hillary, makes a mistake they go back to their pollsters and say what did we say wrong? When Jeb Bush says that he's not gonna help women on women's health issues, I say, I can't believe he just said that. Then they come back three hours later and says he misspoke...
Very briefly, say you are talking to somebody on the street and they go Mr. Trump, I don't really understand what devalue the currency means. What does that mean to me? I buy stocks in my IRA. I expect them to be, you know, profitable. And now they are not because of China devaluing -- devaluating their economy. What does that mean?
Well, they are not devaluing their economy. They are actually in some ways increasing there.
Keeping your enemy close is a good geopolitical strategy? You don't buy that.
No, I don't believe that. I don't believe that ever took place. I think that what has happened is China has gone out of its way to devalue. They got away with it they kept devaluing. And all of a sudden they built this monster but they have also built a monster bubble.
Ok. Two people coming to the United States of note in September, the Pope, ok, and the President of China is coming. A man named Xi Jinping. Do you know Xi Jinping? him? I have never heard of him. I don't know who he is. He is the President.
Very smart.
He is coming over. He is getting a big dinner free at the White House, addressing the U.N. If you were president of would you be throwing him a dinner?
I would not be throwing him a dinner. We've had this conversation -- I would get him a McDonald's hamburger and say you we have to get down to work because you can't continue to devalue. You know, we will give him a steak dinner and what he has done is sucked all of our jobs. And he suck some money right out of our country.
Again, he hasn't done it. U.S. companies do it. They are doing it. So, you would be confrontational with the Chinese? You are saying look, I'm not giving you a dinner.
Excuse me --
I don't buy that for a second.
The problem with -- I do 100 percent, Bill.
Those companies, they go over there because they want as much money as they can. They go to Mexico. Our government lets them do it but this is a free nation. So they want --
But our government.
-- to go over and do it, you can't stop them. Now, you could punish them.
Bill, our government, our government should have stopped China from devaluing.
They can't.
They never even bring them up. It's the numbers -- of course, they can.
How?
Do you know how they can?
Yes, how.
Very simply, Bill, it's so simple. They put a tariff on Chinese goods.
All right. Then you have got a trade war.
You have to do that. And then you bring it back to normal. You have no choice. You do that. Our government doesn't even -- by the way, China does it to us. Do you think that we sell to China without a tariff? They call it a tariff. I call it a tax.
There is no question the imbalance --
China is taxing our goods.
There's no question the imbalance is that way.
There's a total imbalance -- do you know what the big imbalance is? Intelligence. Their leaders are intelligent. Ours aren't. We don't know what we are doing. We had to do this and it should have taken place a long time ago, and you wouldn't have this bubble right now, Bill.
Ok. So I'm not going to get Xi Jinping and you together. I was going to take you both out to dinner I'm not doing that. So I think it might be --
I'd get along with him very well. I have great relationship with China and Chinese --
All right. But do stay on this family.
And we will bring them back if they have done a good job we bring them back. Bill, if they have done a good job, we bring them back.
Wait, wait, wait, wait. I got the theory. All right? Two American citizen kids, all right, you have got two illegal alien parents. They are living in a house -- a little house in the east side of Los Angeles. All of a sudden ICE agents show up, all right, knock on the door and say you have to come with us, put them in a van, bring them to a detention center. You're willing to do that?
Bill, I don't want to do it. I have a bigger heart than anybody running, but we have a country that's totally out of control. We have no laws anymore. We have no order. We don't even know how many people are in here illegally. We have to get a process started. And if you remember --
But isn't there a better way than that kind of a confrontation?
Bill, Bill, Bill. Let me just tell you something. You are asking about illegal immigration. If it weren't for me, this whole session, this -- all of these people that you are interviewing every night, they wouldn't even be talking about illegal immigration.
All right. There's no doubt about it.
It's a huge problem in this country.
No doubt about it.
I took a lot of heat for it. And Bill, I took a lot of heat for it, especially the first two weeks and now everybody said you had Kate -- beautiful Kate just killed by this person that's disgusting, that came here five times.
Right.
And probably was pushed over the border five times. You have Jamiel, have you so many. You have the woman the other night. You remember in Los Angeles -- she was raped, sodomized tortured and killed, a veteran. 66-year-old woman by an illegal immigrant. We have no choice. And by the way, Bill, I have to finish.
Wait, wait, wait. All right, go.
Bill, I have to finish. Faster. We have no choice. You know, the gangs that you are talking about in Baltimore and in Chicago and in Ferguson and all this stuff, you know many of those gangs are illegal immigrants. These are tough dudes. They would be -- if I'm elected, they are going to be out of there day one. We are going to get them the hell had out of our country.
All right. And I don't mind that.
They shouldn't be here in the first place. They're going to be out so fast your head will spin.
But first, our guest tonight joins us right now. He is the man of the hour and the man of the tower, Donald J. Trump. Thank you for joining us, Mr. Trump.
Great to be with you both, wow.
You will know that there has been a tragic shooting today in Virginia, --
Yes.
-- two people killed, three people shot on live TV. Do you have any thoughts about that piece of news?
Well I haven't seen it yet because I have been in the office all day. But I have been hearing about it and it's just horrible. And it's almost got to be a first. It was literally on live television, what a shame, what a shame.
So then you said 10 to 20 percent. What are the odds today you're the next President of the United States?
Maybe 21 percent?
And take that out.
-- because it's about five sounds I hear on there. But if I have a deal that's going to be done and it's ready to be signed, and you way what are the odds, I say 50.
You gave us odds two months ago. You said 10 to 20 percent.
Well I mean they're up.
What are the --
The polls are so good.
But how high? And just give us the numbers again, straight talk. How many -- what are your odds that you're the next President of the United States?
Let's say maybe 25 or 30 percent.
25 or 30.
Maybe.
That's still pretty low.
I think it's very low. I want to be conservative.
So if you're president, I want to ask --
Be conservative.
-- if you're president I want to ask you if that's something you'll face President Obama is facing is this year. Every president, President Reagan and others, have dealt with having to raise the debt ceiling. That's an issue that divides the Republican Party. Should Republicans this -- later this year agree to raise the debt ceiling, or is there too much of a danger to the economy if they don't agree to raise it?
I would like to see them not have to do it. I think there is so much waste, and there is so much actually scandalous waste in Washington that you should haven't to do it.
But be realistic.
If they had people that knew how to cut and knew how to make deals with others -- if you look at what's going on our trade deficits with all of these countries that we're actually rebuilding, we're rebuilding the world. We're rebuilding China. You look at what's happening there. But short-term, maybe it's going to happen. I would not be a very easy one to do it, however.
So, again, just to clarify. So you agree with those Republicans who say don't necessarily raise the debt ceiling. Take the risk. Make President Obama make a compromise on the budget.
I do. I do.
OK.
There is a lot of fat. You could do a lot of cutting.
So in recent days you got some attention for some comments about the hedge fund industry, where you said they were getting away with murder because they pay lower taxes on carried interest. Hillary Clinton has proposed that we should get rid of that carried interest loophole and tax carried interest at the same rate as ordinary income.
Right.
Do you agree with her?
Well I'll tell you this. And the answer is, yes, the carried interest is really a tremendous burden on the country. I have friends that are make -- and enemies, mostly enemies, frankly, otherwise maybe I wouldn't be saying this, but I am saying it for the good of the country. And none of them are going to support me, and I don't want their support, although I could get it if I want it. And, speaking to that, Hillary Clinton has many hedge fund people supporting her.
Right.
So in the end, I would say that the hedge fund people make a lot of money and they pay very little tax. I'm about the middle class. I want the middle class to be thriving again. We're losing our middle-class.
So change the tax code?
I would change it. I would simplify it. I would --
But in this respect, you want to tax carried interest in the same way as ordinary income is taxed.
I would take carried interest out, and I would let people that are making hundreds of millions of dollars a year pay some tax, because right now they're paying very little tax, and I think it's outrageous. I want to lower taxes for the middle class. I want to lower taxes for people that are making a lot of money that need incentives.
So that would affect not just hedge fund people. That would also affect people in limited real estate partnerships, of which you are in a fair number.
I'm OK.
So you're proposed -- you're proposing that you'd like to raise taxes on yourself in this instance.
That's right. That's right. I'm OK with it, ready, willing. And you've seen my statements. I mean I do very well. I don't mind paying some tax. The middle class is getting clobbered in this country. The middle class built this country, not the hedge fund guys. But I know people in hedge funds, they pay almost nothing, and it's ridiculous, OK?
Would you repudiate David Duke?
Sure. I would do that if it made you feel better. I would certainly repute -- I don't know anything about him. Somebody told me yesterday, whoever he is, he did endorse me. And actually I don't think it was an endorsement. He said I was absolutely the best of all the candidates. But I wouldn't want it.
But if you read this story and read a lot of people who are white, and organized white supremacist groups talking ebulliently about you, talking why they about -- why they like you so much, would that trouble you at all? Does that give you pause, make you wonder about your message?
Honestly, John, I would have to read the story. A lot of people like me. In the poll that just came out in New Hampshire, where I am a very high number, 35 percent, the people like me across the board. Evangelicals like me. The Democrats like me. Liberals like me. Conservatives like me.
Absolutely.
Everybody likes me.
And this is only, obviously only a -- this is only a small subset, but hearing that doesn't make you worry that there is something in your message that's striking a chord with the wrong kind of people?
Well I hope there is not. I hope there is not, but I haven't read the story. I haven't seen it.
So the next debate is coming up, and one of the things you said about the first debate was you got the hardest questions. I want to ask you a question that was asked of a different candidate, and see how you would answer. This was asked of Governor Kasich. He said -- the question was if you had a son or daughter, I'll expand it to a grandchild as well, who was gay or lesbian, how would you explain to them your opposition to same-sex marriage? So don't tell me why you support your position. How would you speak to a child or grandchild who was gay?
Well it's the way it is. I wouldn't speak to them at all about it, other than they are who they are. And I want them to be happy, and I will love them and I will cherish them.
But how can you explain your personal opposition to same-sex marriage if they're -- and you had a gay son, daughter or grandchild who said I want to get married, but you don't want it to be legal. How would you explain it to them?
Well I thought actually Governor Kasich's answer was a very good one. He went -- he has gone to gay weddings. I have gone to gay weddings, I have been at gay weddings. I have been against from the standpoint of the Bible, from the standpoint of my teachings as growing up and going to Sunday School and going to church, and I have been opposed to it. And we'll just see how it all comes out. But if I was ever in that position I'd just have to explain it.
OK. You mentioned the Bible. You've been talking about how it's your favorite book, and you said I think last night in Iowa. And some people are surprised that you say that. I'm wondering what one or two of your most favorite Bible verses are and why.
Well I wouldn't want to get into it because to me that's very personal. And when I talk about the Bible it's very personal. So I don't want to get into verses.
There's no verses.
And I don't want to get into --
There's no verse that means a lot to you that you think about or cite?
The Bible means a lot to me, but I don't want to get into specifics.
Even to cite a verse that you like?
No. I don't want to do that.
Are you an Old Testament guy or a New Testament guy?
Probably equal. I think it's just an incredible -- the whole Bible is an incredible -- I joke very much so. They always hold up "The Art of the Deal," I say my second favorite book of all time. But I just think the Bible is just something very special.
Have you ever read the Quran? Do you have a view of that as a book?
I have not. I have not read that.
What's your view of that as a piece of important world history?
Well, it's certainly a piece of world history, and lots of things are happening, but it's not something that I have a lot of interest in. I would like to find out what's happening, why there is such hatred, why there's -- I mean you look at what's going on in the world, and it's wonderful to say, hey, let's not look at Sweden, and let's not look at Norway and let's not look at different places, but you look at what's happening with the Quran, it's a pretty scary thing.
Scott Walker the other day made a comment about -- he said there are a handful of moderate Muslims who are not attracted to the more Jihadist ideologies of terrorists. Do you agree with that?
Well I don't know. And I'm not sure he knew exactly what he meant. Define it.
Well I'm not sure exactly what he meant either, but he used that.
And that's the problem. Nobody knew what he meant.
Only a handful of moderate Muslims. Would you agree with that, or not?
Well I think you have more than a handful of moderate Muslims, but you certainly have a problem with Muslims. And I think he probably misspoke, as Bush would say, because every time he makes a mistake he goes out and he says that he misspoke. I think Scott probably misspoke. Did he corrected his statement?
He later tried to.
Yes, because you do have much more than a handful, but at the same time we have problems.
Right.
Do we all agree? I mean there are certain problems.
Let me ask you two historical questions right now. Do you believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone?
I believe he acted alone, yes.
You do.
I believe he acted alone.
No conspiracy theories for you.
I don't know -- no, not for me. I think he probably acted alone. Who knows?
OK.
But I, in my opinion, he acted alone.
And my, well my second historical question, between Clarence Thomas and Anita Hill, who do you believe in their account of that controversy?
I really have a lot of respect -- I like Clarence Thomas a lot, and I will go with Clarence Thomas. I think he's really been a very -- his decisions are, in terms really of conservative decisions, he is probably about the best there is on the Supreme Court, certainly one of them.
So you think Anita Hill lied when she said that he had made unwanted --
I'm not --
-- and engaged in inappropriate activity.
What do I know? I just respect Clarence Thomas. I don't know Anita Hill. I'd met Clarence Thomas on a number of occasions. I thought he was terrific. I think he's a terrific person. So what do I know? I mean you're asking me a question like that's sort of a crazy question.
Well it was a question that divided the country for a period of time, and over which there still is a lot of division. People have taken sides in that debate for a long time.
I'm happy he was appointed to the Supreme Court, and I think his decisions have been terrific decisions, from my way of thinking.
I want to ask a couple more historical things. You were a Democrat. Now you're a Republican. And do you recall who you supported in 1992 when it was George Bush, Bill Clinton and Ross Perot?
I liked -- I actually liked Ross Perot a lot. And I thought he was great. And then I think he went off, a little bit off the deep end, unfortunately, but I thought he was good. I will say this, had he not existed, you don't -- you're not talking about Bill Clinton and you're not worried about Hillary Clinton right now.
But do you recall who you voted for?
I don't know. I think I probably voted for Bush actually.
For Bush, OK.
But I respected Perot. I think Perot really hit something. Had he not gone out and come back in, and a lot of crazy things happened, I think he probably would've had a number that was substantially better.
And you said probably though, so you don't remember which of those three? You're not clear about which of them?
Yes, I do remember. I don't like to talk about who I voted for. In this case I voted for Bush.
All right. I know you said you didn't like to, but let me ask you about one more, 2004 versus the other Bush, do you remember who you supported in that election?
Bush.
Bush.
Yes.
Why?
Bush. I was hoping he would do a good job, OK?
What didn't you like about Bush?
Well I don't like what he did with the war. I think Iraq was a --
Yes.
And you can't force that, and it was a little bit forced. But how are you going to pay for it? We're spending $130 billion right now on illegal immigration. We are spending a fortune not only the crime and all the problems that is being caused, but we're spending a minimum of $130 billion. You're going to pay for it because we're not going to be spending that kind of money. That's one way we're going to pay for it.
Now who would you say who is more likely than Bush?
There's a group of them. Really there's sort of a group that seems to be forming. But so far they're way behind.
Jeb Bush recommended the other day you should read his book on immigration. You going to do that anytime soon?
No, I don't think so.
Why not?
Because I have other things to do that are I think much more important.
He got a little tangled up in this question about anchor babies, right?
Terrible.
What do you think he has gotten wrong about that?
Well I read the "New York Times" editorial today. I mean he took the Hispanics, and all of a sudden he changed Hispanics and Mexicans with the Asians. And now the Asian community is furious at him, and they're really angry at him. I have seen -- there's protests going on about what he said. So he thought he would get out of that by talking about Asians, and that was terrible. I mean that was terrible.
And that's not a word -- that's not a phrase that you have any hesitance about using about throughout this campaign.
No. I'm using it.
Right.
And nobody has complained about it when I use it. They complain about it because they don't expect he would be using that. He actually signed a memo saying, do no use anchor babies. You know that, right? He signed a memo saying, don't use anchor babies, don't use the phrase. It's not appropriate. And then he uses it. Now he uses it because I'm using it. And I think he has to want to -- maybe he wants to keep up with it. I'm not sure why. Maybe he shouldn't be using it, but I am going to.
Would you consider him as your running mate?
I just don't want to talk about running mates right now. I like to do one thing at a time.
So let's talk about this.
Right now I'm looking good. I want to keep looking good. I'm not talking about running mates.
Yes. And you've mentioned -- you've talked about Carl Icahn and other people you might want in your administration.
Yes.
Is there someone out there today who you says isn't on the court, but say this is the kind of person I would consider for the court?
Well I don't want to mention names. I think it's inappropriate to mention names, and certainly at this stage where it's so early and a long way to go.
How about your sister?
Well my sister is great. I have a sister who is on the court of appeals and she is fantastic.
Yes, but you would say --
And by the way, you mentioned Carl Icahn, John. I just spoke to him.
Yes.
And he said such a big problem, corporate inversion.
Yes.
Where we $2.5 trillion sitting outside, can't come in. And now what's happening is companies are leaving this country. It used to be you leave New York for Florida, or you leave New Jersey for Texas or something. It used to be state to state. Now it's country for country. We have companies with thousands and thousands of jobs that are leaving this country --
So what's the Trump --
-- to go out and get their money.
You have been expressing a lot of concern about the Chinese currency devaluation.
Big, big concern.
It's the case when the currency is devalued that the price of Chinese goods goes down, which means Americans pay less for the goods that we buy from China.
It means we also make less because we're not making our own profit.
Let me ask you. We've just got a minute left. So you announced for president right down there just over two months ago. Does it seem longer than that?
It seems longer, but it's gone fast, nevertheless. I'm so happy with the way it's --
Yes. What's been the single highlight and the single lowlight since you announced?
Well I think the lowlight was when I was attacked for the words illegal immigration. And it's turned out to be maybe also the highlight because now people are saying, you know, he was right. You had that horrible story with Kate, and so many people, Kate from San Francisco, so many people were so badly hurt. I mean what's happened is incredible. So I think that was maybe a highlight. And it was also a lowlight.
I think it may have been the word rapist, though that got you into more trouble than illegal immigration.
Well there's plenty of that too. You have criminals coming. Look just the other day in California, and a man came over, illegal immigrant, 66-year-old, raped her, killed her, sodomized her, tortured her, raped her. I mean you have that too. I mean we can be babies and we can say it doesn't exist, tremendous crime coming in. I think I have done a great service, frankly. I hope I have.
Mr. Trump, thank you for hosting us today.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
And we'll see you out on the campaign trail.
Thank you, Mark. Thank you, John.
I begin today's program with Donald Trump, about whom everyone in America is talking. Donald Trump, welcome back, I say I'd start every show of mine with you, you're such a ratings draw. So just be available more, would you?
Oh, I'd love to, Hugh. How are you doing?
I'm great. Now I want to get to the Jorge Ramos thing in a moment. I want to ask you first, though, because of a story this afternoon in the Huffington Post, you've said, you know, you wouldn't run third party if the GOP treated you fairly. Are they treating you fairly so far?
Well, I didn't see any story in the Huffington Post. So I don't know what story that is. What story is that?
It quotes Michael Cohen saying that asked specifically if Trump would be making a formal announcement that he would pledge not to run third party, Cohen replied only Mr. Trump can sign that oath, and when he does, you can rest assured he will live by it. And Mr. Cohen indicated you had, you'd pretty much been happy with the way the GOP had been treating you.
They have been treating me fairly, I think very fairly. And you know, maybe it's, you see the kind of polls that are coming out. They've been so terrific and so high and so wonderful. The one that just came out in New Hampshire, a Public Policy has been, I guess it's 35%, and way in the lead. And all of them, and so I'm very honored by that, and I will say that the RNC and the Republican Party, I think I've been treated very fairly over the last period of time, yes.
So are you ruling out a third party run?
Well, it's not something I'd want to do, and at some point, I'll you know, actually totally commit. You know, I didn't think it was appropriate to commit during the debate, because it was, you know, just, I was a little surprised by the fact that they even asked me at that debate, but that was OK. But at some point, look, I want to run. I'm leading in the polls by a lot. I want to run as a Republican. I want to get the nomination, and then I want to beat the Democrats, and I think that's our best chance for a victory. I think we will win. And we have to energize, because you know, last time, sadly, Hugh, a lot of people did not get out and vote. And I still, to this day, don't understand it. But a lot of the Republicans and a lot of conservatives just never got up to vote. They just weren't energized, and I think this time, they're going to be plenty energized.
But I've told you before, I'll just say it again. I think your numbers go up the day you take that pledge.
Well, I've been told that by a lot of people. Steve Wynn is a good friend of mine, and he's a great guy from Las Vegas. You know, he's done a fantastic job.
Of course.
And he says the same thing. He says when you go and you actually do that, and make that firm, firm commitment, your numbers are going to bounce, and maybe bounce quite a bit. So you're saying that also. So now I have two very smart people that tell me that.
Well, OK, you can make that announcement anytime in this conversation you'd like.
OK.
I want to turn to Jorge Ramos.
OK.
I loved that interview yesterday when you called yourself a builder. I immediately thought you're also a television pro with many seasons under your belt. The moment that Ramos stood up and started to orate, did the light go on in your mind that this was a television moment?
Not really. I mean, you have to be careful. I had a lot of cameras. You know, there was a tremendous crowd. We had 4,000 people there, and you saw the room. It was packed and energized. And likewise, before I went out, I mean, literally, just before I went on stage, I did this press avail, as they call it, or the press conference. And there were tremendous numbers of reporters there. It was packed. It was, you know, a room that was just absolutely packed with moving television cameras and everybody else. And I'm getting ready to start the press conference, and I actually picked on one person, and I said listen, go ahead, and it was actually Fox. It was Carl Cameron. And then I said another one, and all of a sudden, a man stood up and started like screaming at me. And I said who is that, and he just started, and he wasn't saying can I speak. He was just telling me things. He wasn't like, you know, asking questions. He was just telling me things. And it was a very loud, shrill voice, and I said what's going on over here. And ultimately, I figured he was a Univision person, and I figured that was Jorge, and you know, I just didn't think it was appropriate the way he behaved. He was screaming, and I thought it was actually very unfair not so much to me, which I guess you could say it was, but it was certainly very unfair to all the other reporters that were waiting with their hands up to take questions. And I would have gotten to him, 100%. I have no problem with doing that.
Yeah, what he did was, it was not professional. I've been doing this for 25 years. It wasn't professional. But it was successful for him, and it was also, though, very successful for you because of the way you handled him. And I was actually reminded, do you remember when the Iraqi threw the shoe at George W. Bush?
Yes.
And he didn't blink, and he just carried on?
Yes.
That's what it reminded me of. And you see why?
Well, that may have been his best moment, if you want to know the truth, which is pretty sad to say. But the truth is I didn't think in terms of television. I just said you know, who's this guy that's screaming? I don't think, I think when you're doing a lot of live television, you don't necessarily think that you're on live television, but that was live all over the place. And I just thought it was inappropriate. The first thing I thought, it was really unfair, because they had so many people with good, you know, sitting with hands up, and wanting to ask questions. And this man was standing up and really shouting quite loud. Now you didn't hear the extent of it, because you didn't have a microphone. Had he had a microphone on, and yet you still heard him, because he was shouting so loud.
Yeah.
But if he had a microphone, he would have blasted everybody out of the room. So it worked out fine, and it probably was good for him. And actually, at the end, by the time we finished, I mean, I didn't think he was such a bad guy. I'm glad I invited him back, because I think maybe I would have been criticized if I didn't invite him back with some people, you know, the concept of getting him out, which people didn't mind, but I think they wanted him back. So it was an interesting evening. Had I...
Oh, you know what the most interesting part of that presser was, Donald Trump, when you brought up Normal Vincent Peale.
Oh, yes.
Now I know about Dr. Norman Vincent Peale. Many people might not. How often did you hear him preach? Do you have a favorite book of the Bible or a favorite verse? And do you have a favorite hymn? If you were a churchgoer at the Marble Collegiate Church, that's a big deal.
Yeah. Well, I was, and I just, I just Norman Vincent Peale. You know, he would talk, and we go to church, and you go to church, and as good as we are, sometimes, you know, you could, you can leave church and you're not so upset. I used to be, I used to love his sermons. I used to love his, he would speak, and he'd bring things from the Bible, Hugh, he would bring them into modern day territory. I remember he was talking about Alfred Sloan, who had tremendous difficulties as a young man. He founded General Motors. And he would talk about Alfred Sloan, who was a friend of his, a great friend of his. He had great friendships with very substantial people. And he's talk about him, and Alfred Sloan had an alcohol problem, and he had lots of difficulties. And he got rid of these difficulties, and he'd bring it into sort of a modern day feeling, meaning, you know, bring it updated. And he would give, he was one of the best speakers I've ever seen. And you would literally leave church, and you would say I could listen to another three sermons. I was there when he made his last sermon, and it was very sad, because he became, you know, he was very old, and he was almost unable to finish the sermon. He was clutching, you know, the podium. And he was reading, and he was clutching, and he said, I can't go on any further. I was there in that room. You know, the amazing thing about Norman Vincent Peale, when some churches were empty, his church always had overfill areas. Maybe that's why I'm always glad that I always have overfill areas, right?
Did he leave you...
But he would always have, they had rooms throughout the church, Marble Collegiate Church, where they'd have like cameras, they'd have closed circuit televisions. And if you didn't get there early, you wouldn't be able to sit in a fairly large church. You'd have to sit on one of the rooms, one of the conference rooms where they had the closed circuit. But he was a fantastic speaker, a wonderful speaker.
And given that, that you had this great preacher all those years, and your mom was a Scots emigre, I learned. Did you get your reformed roots from her?
I would say maybe. I mean, she was religious, and my father was religious. I was actually Presbyterian, which is interesting. I actually, my first church was First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, which is in Queens, because I didn't join Marble Collegiate until much later. And that wasn't Presbyterian, but it was just a church that I liked, and I liked him.
It was reformed, yeah.
But I was actually Presbyterian, and then I came into Manhattan, and I joined Marble Collegiate.
So what was your mother like?
Well, she was from Scotland, and she came over at 19, met my father. They were married for, I guess, about 65 years. They had a great marriage. She was a terrific woman. She was a very beautiful woman, they tell me, as a young man. They said she was like a real beauty, of great beauty, and my father was a builder in Brooklyn, in Queens, And he was build houses, and they met, and she never went back to Scotland. Now she would go back to Scotland every year. She loved Scotland. But she never officially went back, because she married my father, and they had five children.
But she was the religious one.
And it was a terrific marriage, actually.
What I'm trying to get at, if she's the religious one, do you think today the Gospels have any role in shaping public policy? You said you're doing very well with the Evangelicals.
Well, the Evangelicals, they're sort of interesting. I mean, I am a religious person, I would say not formally like some might be, you know, like some would talk about it. But I am, you know, somebody that believes, and I am, it's very interesting, because I noticed that the polls came out. The one in New Hampshire, Public Policy Polling, where it said 35%, and it sort of said it leads across with Tea Party, with Evangelicals, with moderates, with just about everything. They even said with Democrats, I mean, just lead straight across the board. And I think a lot of people were surprised. They thought it would be very conservative, and which I lead big in the very conservative. But I lead straight across. And one of the things that made me very happy was that I actually lead, and you've seen this even in Iowa where I lead with Evangelicals. And I was so happy to see that, because they think that's the real me, but I don't think people see that as me.
Do you think they expect you to, but do you think the Gospels have some way of informing your public policy choices? Or is that just a different category?
I don't know. I think that maybe so, you know, down deep, maybe they do. I think what's happening in the country where it just seems that you know, the word Christmas is being taken out. I see these stores like Macy's and so many others. They're afraid to use the word Christmas now. Maybe they can't use it, legally. What's going on is outrageous, and I would try and, not only try, I will do things about it. You're going to have to go through court systems. That's the problem. I mean, you have to go through actually courts now to use names that you should be able to use automatically. But you know, the whole thing is changing, Hugh, so much toward religion and what you can say and what you can't say, and what you can put up in a beautiful public area, where for years you'd have the manger, and you'd have, you know, Mary and Jesus, and now you're not allowed to do it.
Well, now in Denver.
And I think it's terrible. I think it's terrible.
I'm on the campus of a Colorado Christian college today. In Denver, where we're close to, their city councils have said Chick-Fil-A, maybe they can't build at the Denver International Airport because their founders are Evangelical and have traditional marriage views. It's blatantly unconstitutional.
Wow. Wow.
Have you heard that story, yet?
I haven't heard it, but it doesn't surprise me. It's horrible. What's going on is horrible. I mean, you can't do, you can't do anything having to do with really deep-seated, incredible beliefs that really, to a large extent, made our country great. You know, these, the beliefs in the Bible had a lot to do with our country. And I mean, a week doesn't go by where there's not some negative ruling on something having to do with Christianity. It's getting, I think it's outrageous, and I'll tell you what.
All right, let me get a couple of...
I'll be fighting on the other side much stronger than anybody else that you have up there fighting, because I think it's really outrageous.
Let me talk about two big issues, tough ones. I always ask you tough but fair questions. China has gotten very erratic. Their markets are strange behavior. Do you think that South Korea and Japan ought to consider going nuclear to match their erratic neighbor?
Well, they have a very erratic neighbor, and you know, the whole concept of us protecting Japan was so they didn't arm again, because we had a little problem with them, as you remember. And that wasn't a good situation. But you know, there's got to be a point where we cannot protect everybody. You know, we're protecting everybody. I talked about it last night in my speech from Iowa. It was such an amazing group of people. And you know, we're protecting Germany, we're protecting Japan. We're protecting South Korea. Hugh, I just bought 4,000 television sets on a big project I built, and 4,000, and they all come, every bidder is from South Korea. They're making a fortune, and yet we have 28,000 soldiers at the border. And...
Well, should they go, should they build their own nuclear weapons in South Korea?
Well, I don't know. You know, it's a question. The problem is you're going to have, all of a sudden, you're going to have everybody having nuclear weapons, and that's a scary prospect, also. But in the meantime, you have North Korea, that obviously has them.
Right.
Now I don't know if they know how to use them, yet.
Right.
Because every time you see a rocket go up, it comes crashing to the ground. But you know, that's the easy part. I mean, in theory, that's the easy part. So it's a pretty frightening prospect. I do say this. At some point, we can't be the policemen of the world. We have to rebuild our own country. We have to rebuild our bridges and our highways and our roads and schools and our airports. And how much longer can we be doing this? You know...
I'm trying to, though. Scott...
If you noticed with South Korea, North Korea started rearing its head a couple of days ago, and we all of a sudden, we're engaged and we're getting ready. We don't get anything for this, Hugh. You know, at what point, at what point, and they're wealthy. The reason I tell about the 4,000 televisions, they make a fortune in trade against us. You understand that.
Well, that's, you know, earlier this week, Scott Walker said the President should cancel the state visit from President Xi. And do you agree with that suggestion, by the way?
No, I don't think you should cancel it. I think you should negotiate better deals. Our trade pacts with China are horrible, and you know, if you want to do, I have a friend who's a big trader and a big manufacturer. He can't get his goods into China. And when he does get them in, they charge him a big tax. Well, people don't know those stories. You know, if you sell trucks in China, they charge you taxes to get them in. People don't understand it's a one-way street. We...
OK, you wouldn't cancel it. Last question, because you know, you're...
I would not. Yeah, I would not, but I'd negotiate it and I'd say listen, it's over.
Will you negotiate on my behalf with Hope, because I need a negotiator with Hope, because she keeps me to 15 minutes with you, and you know, I could use like two hours.
Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it.
All right.
You can have as long as you...
Here's my tough question. In tough times, republics turn to tough men. It's happened throughout history -- Caesar, Napoleon, the last century had a lot of republics fail, and I don't have to invoke Godwin's Law and go that far, but are you tickling that temptation in democracies that they go for tough guys in tough times, and it's called the authoritarian temptation? Is that's what's playing for Trump?
Well, I think we've had very weak people. I think we have very weak people even running. I look at some of the people that are running, and I think they're not strong people. And they're good people. I'm not saying they're not good people, but I think it is time to have tough, smart people. If you look at China, if you look at some of these countries that are just eating our lunch, they have tough, smart people. It's time that we have tough, smart people, because we're not going to be able to go much longer the way we're going right now. We owe $18 trillion. And by the way, that $18 trillion's going to be about $21 trillion very quickly. You know, it builds, it's going to build, right now, from this point, very, very rapidly. We're not doing well. That, I can tell you. So...
Well then, when people say Trump will an authoritarian, once he gets power, he won't give it back, what's the response going to be?
Well, no, I just want to make the country great again. I'm not looking to do this. I have a wonderful life. People say why are you even doing it.
Yes, you do.
I love my life. I love what I've done. I've built a great company. But I want to make this country great again. I owe a lot to this country, and I want to make it great again. And we can do it. And honestly, it cannot continue to go like this, otherwise, there'll be a point at which you can't bring it back, Hugh.
But you'll play by the rules if you win?
100%. 100%. I always play by the rules.
The Constitution, I mean, by the Constitution, you wouldn't...
No, Obama doesn't play. He goes out...
Exactly.
... and dodged, he signs his executive orders all over the place, because he doesn't want to meet with people and try and convince them to do what the right thing to do is. No, he's not playing by the rules. No, I do play by the rules. I will play by the rules, too.
Donald Trump, it is always a pleasure. Come back. You tell Hope, you know, I'm not perfect, but I'm the best when it comes to this stuff.
You did a good job. I didn't even know you had the 15. You could have had three 15's if you wanted, Hugh.
Oh, my gosh, I'm a terrible negotiator for myself. I'll keep going if you want, but I promised Hope, so I'm letting you go.
Hugh, you'll do better the next time then, and thanks a lot, Hugh. I appreciate it.
Let's get right to Donald Trump on the phone. Mister Trump, good morning to you.
Good morning, Matt.
Good to talk to you. So -- so this confrontation last night, Jorge Ramos has been an outspoken critic of your immigration policy. We can debate at length whether he should have waited his turn to ask that question but you did tell him to sit down repeatedly and then threw in a -- a go Back to Univision for good measure. Do -- do feuds like this, Donald, work for you? Do you think this helps you with your supporters?
Well, I don't know. Obviously, I have very big support because I'm leading in every poll by double digits and, you know, there is a -- there is a movement going on. There is a whole silent majority thing happening. And it's very impressive to see. I will tell you he was totally out of line last night. I was asking and being asked a question from another reporter. I would have gotten to him very quickly. And he stood up and started ranting and raving like a madman. And frankly, he was out of line. And most people -- in fact, most newspaper report said I handled it very well. He was totally, absolutely out of line.
You have said, Donald, that when people treat me unfairly, I don't let them forget me and that leads me to Megyn Kelly. We all know what happened after the -- the debate. You thought she was unfair in her questioning to you and then nineteen days later, she comes back from vacation on Monday and it seemed like in an unprovoked attack you went back after her, questioning her appearance, her performance and then retweeting a very unflattering comment about her that called her a bimbo. Why have you let Megyn Kelly get so far under your skin?
Well, I haven't. I mean, you know, if you tweet a few tweets or retweet in this case, that's not getting under your skin. I, personally I'm not a fan. I don't think she does a good job. I don't think she's a very good professional. And I think frankly the show is better without her. But that's up to them and they can do whatever they want.
You know what --
-- I respect -- I respect Roger Ailes. He can do whatever he wants. I don't care.
It starts to sound a little bit -- and take this in the right way, Donald, like you're a guy with a schoolyard crush. When we were in elementary school and -- and junior high school, you know, guys often say the meanest things about the girls they like the most.
Trust me, Matt, there is no crush that I can tell you. And as far as I was concerned during the debate she asked me questions that were totally inappropriate. Other people were asked nice questions about jobs, about God, about other things. And she hits me with questions that were totally inappropriate. Every -- a lot of people said that. Many people agreed with me. She knows it better than anybody because Fox was -- you talk about Twitter. She was -- they were -- they were going after Fox big league because of the kind of questions I was asked that night. And despite that, every poll of the debate had me winning. TIME magazine had me winning. Drudge had me winning the debate.
But the chairman --
But I was not asked fair question.
-- the chairman of Fox News Roger Ailes called your attack on Megyn Kelly unacceptable and disturbing. Here's part of his statement, "I could not be more proud of Megyn for her professionalism and class in the face of all of Mister Trump's verbal assaults." He went on to say, "Donald Trump rarely apologizes, although in this case he should. We have never been deterred by politicians or anyone else attacking us for doing our job, much less allowed ourselves to be bullied by anyone and we're not going to start now." Do you -- do you embrace the term bullied, Donald, when it comes to your dealings with the press?
I'm not a bully. In fact, I think it's just the opposite way. I'm not a bully. You saw that last night. This man gets up and starts ranting and raving and screaming and honestly, very disrespectful to all the other reporters. We had a packed house. We had a tremendous group of people in Iowa. The -- the room was -- was packed with thousands of people.
Right.
The press room was packed prior to. I did a press event prior to. And he gets up and just starts ranting and raving --
Right.
-- and -- and very disrespectful to all of the other reporters- -
Let me --
-- that had questions also.
You're making the Republican establishment nervous. There -- there're are two moves I want to talk to you about. In North Carolina and Virginia, top Republicans are proposing something they're saying if you want to be or any candidate wants to be on their primary ballot, that candidate has to pledge to support the eventual Republican nominee and not to run a third-party candidacy. That is aimed straight at you. How do you respond to that?
Well, first of all, winning those two polls by like a lot also, North Carolina just came out and it's a tremendous, you know, it's a tremendous margin. And, you know, I have great relationships in those states and other states have that same provision. They've had it for years. And I'm going to run, Matt, unless something I want to be treated fairly and I'm being treated fairly by the Republican Party. I'm the front-runner in every poll but I want to run, I want to be treated fairly and I want to run as a Republican, that's where I am. I'm leading in the polls. I think I will get the nomination and I think I will win the election and will make America great again. That's what I want to do.
Let me --
I'm only doing this for one reason, to make our country great again. That's what I'm doing it for, Matt.
Let me -- let me end on this. This is something posted on the Cook Political Report this week written by Amy Walter who compared the embrace of you by some voters as kind of a post college summer fling and wrote this. You're unattached and carefree. You want to connect with someone passionately and fall hopelessly in love. Meanwhile, your parents want you to meet a guy like Jeb Bush. No wonder GOP voters are dallying with Trump. He's everything your parents hate. He's loud, he's disrespectful. He probably smokes and drives a motorcycle. But you don't care. Eventually though you settle down with the responsible guy. Is that the way you see this unfolding?
No, not at all. Jeb Bush is a low energy person. He's never going to take us to the promised land. The country will not work under Jeb Bush. It's going to work the way it is right now where everybody is taking advantage of the United States, everybody is laughing at the United States. I'm getting the biggest crowds. I have the biggest support. As I said, the polls, you know, the polls just came out in New Hampshire and Iowa nationally just yesterday. Every one of them has massive leads. They are tired of the Jeb Bushes of the world, they're tired of the Bushes, they're tired of the Clintons. They are tired of the people that have been running this country into the ground. And I think that's why I have the biggest crowds and I have the biggest polls.
Donald Trump, to be continued. Donald, thanks for joining us. I appreciate it.
Thank you very much, Matt.
Well, let's combine the issue of immigration and the issue of cherishing women. They seem to take the embodiment in two journalists right now, one woman you don't seem to cherish is Megyn Kelly and you had the situation with Jorge Ramos. When you saw them on the show together the other night, did you think to yourself, why did I create these situations again? Why did I bring up the Megyn Kelly thing and go after her again? Why did I go after Jorge Ramos? Why did you do those thing?
First of all, I didn't go after Jorge Ramos. I was at a news conference and he stands up and starts screaming like a madman. When they show the whole clip, everybody understands. In fact, I've gotten a lot of credit from a lot of the people in your industry. He was very rude, very loud and obnoxious and he was standing up and I had picked a man from CBS -- a top anchor at CBS -- to give a question and this guy stands up and starts screaming. He wasn't asking a question, he's giving the speech. That was not a question he was asking. And I did not want to recognize him because it would have been -- the news conference was packed, as was the speech packed. It was packed. The crowd was amazing the other night. And, you know, frankly --
It was a big crowd.
I don't think -- I know I did the right thing. He was rude and obnoxious and if I didn't take control of it, he would have literally been there for -- you wouldn't have even had a news conference. And I did take control. Unlike Bernie Sanders, who lost his microphone with two women they got up and just took his microphone away from him like he was a baby. I won't let that happen. That's not what it's about. As far as Megyn Kelly, I have nothing against her. She's fine as far as I'm concerned. I don't care.
But it raises the question of why make it an issue?
-- I have nothing against Jorge Ramos, by the way. I think he'd be a nice guy. By the time our dialogue ended with Jorge Ramos, it was actually quite pleasant, if you noticed. It really got quite pleasant, which was amazing. You didn't say I let him back in the room and we actually, for five minutes, we went back and forth, but I thought it was actually quite pleasant.
You absolutely did. You did go through it. But these situations are being highlighted about how you deal with people who come at you and whether or not that's the right mode for somebody who wants to be the president, especially with Megyn Kelly because a lot of people say she was doing her job, including her boss. And it makes us wonder, would you have dealt with it the same way if that question had come from Wallace or Behar? Do you think it was something personal to Megyn Kelly?
Well, I did do it the same thing with Wallace. The fact I said the same thing -- I said blood pouring out of his eyes, you know --
I understand that and that's why I draw attention to the fact that you kept that alive, because you do have a lot of important things to talk about. That's why we have you on NEW DAY. There are a lot of big problems and we're looking forward to your solutions. We appreciate you coming on NEW DAY to discuss it. And we look forward to it again because how we fix these problems is the only thing that matters in this election. So thank you for joining us, as always.
Thank you very much. Great honor, Chris, thank you.
I think you're taking it out of context.
Well, nobody's ever ripped my hair to that extent. I had Barbara Walters do it. She just touched it. But Mika was getting very frisky. Nobody has ever attacked me that way. My hair was destroyed for the rest of the day.
Donald, did you feel cheapened or objectified while Mika was clawing your hair?
I felt abused. In fact, it's a good thing. In fact, I think I'll bring a lawsuit against Mika. Do you mind?
Why not? Bring it on. It wouldn't be the first one.
Nowadays you're allowed to sue for something like that. You know, our standards have gone way down.
Right. When you were giving them money.
When I was giving money, absolutely.
Donald, it's Willie. Good morning. Good to talk to you.
Hi, Willie.
I, for one, have never been a hair truther. I've known your hair is real from the very beginning. I just wanted to be on the record with that.
Good. Thank you, Willie.
Let's talk about a serious story that has happened this week that horrified all of us, that shooting in Virginia that took the lives of a reporter and a cameraman down in Roanoke. You said this was not a gun problem in this incident, it was a mental health problem.
Right.
But Donald, if they did report him, it seems to me that should go into a background check area and shouldn't we expand background checks? I mean, you always talk about how government doesn't work and I do, too. One of the areas it doesn't work is on these background checks. Don't we need to fix the background checks and expand it? So if a guy is working for you and he threatens everybody in your office and says I'm going to come back to get you and on the last day that he leaves the office everybody has to cower in the corner, they have to call 911, that guy shouldn't have a gun.
Right.
But he'll get a gun if we don't have a background check.
A couple of times it did work. You know, a couple of these shooters were actually on the list and they were able to get guns. A mistake was made actually by the government where it wasn't reported properly.
Right. That's what I'll saying. Shouldn't we fix -- work to fix the system --
Yes, fix the system --
-- work to close the gun show loophole where terrorists can go in and buy guns without background checks. I mean, doesn't all that make good common sense?
I think what you have, Joe, if you look we actually have strong laws on the books. And again, you look at places like Chicago. Look at New York City. In New York City, we have among the toughest gun laws in the country and we have gun violence. It's a real problem. But we have the laws. So you have to make the laws work. The government is not making the laws work. But beyond that, you do have a huge mental health problem. There's no question about it.
Mr. Trump, I want to go back to this issue of you and the establishment. You're freaking a lot of people out. They're worried now that you might be the nominee or be what they consider a disruptive force. Two people in particular constantly talking right about you in a negative way: George Will, Charles Krauthammer. I'm wondering if you think you can become the Republican nominee without winning them over? Or you don't care about winning them over?
Well, you know, it's funny, a lot of the pundits have come a long way. In fact, yesterday at the speech, and I was very proud because the CNN reporter said it was the single greatest political speech he's ever heard, which was very nice, as far as I'm concerned.
Which reporter was that?
I love that. I had to bring that up because I said, wow, that's a nice --
Who was that?
I don't know her name, but she was wearing a beautiful red dress. She looked good to me. Anybody that says that looks good to me. So --
Yes. He loves you, too.
I've fallen in love with him. I think he's one of the greats. Joe, nobody was hitting me harder than Gene. But there is something happening out there that people -- some people say they've never seen happen before.
A blue suit, for the record. Donald, I was surprised by something you said a few minutes ago, which you were very critical of Prime Minister Abe of Japan. This is a --
No, not critical. I think he's great for Japan. No, no -- I wasn't critical. I think he's doing a great job for Japan.
A lot of the Japanese cars, first of all, are produced here now, as you know. It's true that trade imbalance is about 2:1. But why would we want --
Not 2:1. Richard, it's more than 2:1. It's massive.
When are you coming out with that plan?
Over the next four weeks.
Thank you, Donald.
Thank you very much.
Were you a democrat at that point?
That's going to be politics as usual.
Were you a democrat at that point when you said that?
Well, as one point, I was -- at one point I was a democrat and for a period of time. And over the years, as Ronald Reagan changed, I also changed. I became much more conservative. I also became a republican.
So, your position got changed. You have conservation positions now you believe?
All my positions are change a lot absolutely over the years.
OK.
As they have with Ronald Reagan, Don. As they have with many people. I mean, you changes and some people go the other way, they become more liberal. Although generally, I've found people tend to become a little bit conservative.
OK.
But now I am actually a politician whether I like it or not.
The question is that because of the Iowa polls, you know that you're leading in the polls, right?
Right.
Yes.
... and nobody can understand why we can't negotiate a far better deal than that. And I cannot understand that because I think that's negotiating 101, there's no way that that deal should be approved.
Let me...
If it's approve it's going to be -- it's going to be the scourge on our nation. And by the way, a disaster for Israel.
Yes.
A complete disaster for Israel.
But you said that you're going to do something about immigration. You said that you would -- the 11 million undocumented immigrants that you would like to somehow deport one group. That's one group where your poll numbers have not been so favorable among Hispanics. And I know that you met privately with the head of the Hispanics Chamber of Commerce today.
We did.
But it's in a long...
It has to be legal immigration, not illegal immigration.
... that Mexico sends out people over. But if you could go back, would you amend those statement?.
No.
The Reagan democrats.
I think I'll have democrats for Trump. I think I will have a lot of democrats voting for me, far more than any republican for the last long period of time. I will say this and I will say this, you know, very strongly. The republican conservatives were not energized in the last election. Had they been energized and had they voted, you would have seen victory for Mitt Romney.
All right. Let me finish the question because you had proposed that you want to impose tariffs on American companies who put their factories abroad. You also said hedge fund managers. And my question is, do you think that you can win a republican primary by proposing to raise taxes?
Totally. We're losing all of our jobs. We're losing all our business. You have a terrible thing happening right now, Don. It's called corporate inversion. You know what that is?
OK.
And they're going to Ireland and they're going to other countries where the tax rates are low. And we're losing tremendous companies and we're losing tremendous number of jobs.
I just...
That's a huge problem. I will be able to solve that problem. You don't have anybody else running that knows what. They don't even know what it is.
But isn't that raising taxes on the wealthiest of Americans? That's not raising taxes?
Hey, Don, let me explain. You reported it incorrectly. I said these hedge fund guys are making hundreds of millions of dollars and they're not paying tax.
right.
And they're paying very little tax. And if you're somebody that's making 50,000 and 60,000, and $70,000, number one, your return is so complicated. You have to go H&R block or somebody who I want to put out a business because we have to simplify the tax code. We have to lower the taxes. But we have to lower the taxes on the middle class because we're losing our middle class. They're getting wiped out.
But they've said missed your attacks as, quote, "disturbances." Are you surprised by that?
I don't know what you mean. What I'm saying is that disturbances?
So, you're not holding any more fundraisers?
Don, I'm not going to do it anymore because it's too complicated. People don't understand what it represents. I mean if you something to defer cost, you end up with a story on CNN because CNN was the one that covered that, frankly, and they actually covered it very incorrectly, but these are minor details.
So, even though the sign said...
It gets to be, Don, it gets to be too complicated because people don't know the difference making a contribution to defer cost. I'm just going to pay for the whole thing myself. Because it's, you know, you get stories that are false stories. And, yet, I can understand how they can be rip, frankly.
All right. So, no more fundraisers throughout this campaign?
No, I'm not going to do it.
You're not going to do it.
Now, I have to say this. With all of that being said, many people have forms PACS. I think there is five or six PACS. I have had nothing to do with them.
OK.
You know, I can't help if somebody forms a PAC, if they want to go out and do some advertising or do something. I have nothing to do with that. I'm not putting money into it. I have nothing to do with it.
OK.
You know the law better than me.
OK.
And purposely, I'm not even supposed to talk to those people and I don't. I think other people do talk to people having to do with that, but I don't.
All right. Just before we move on, though, are you going to accept donations, large donations, small donations if people want to give you money?
No. The answer is no.
No. OK.
I'm not going to do that.
Yes.
So, that kind of money we do accept and we like it because we think it's a positive for the campaign.
What do you think of his impression of you?
Well, I thought it was fine. He was trying to be cute and funny. And he's a nice guy. I actually like Chris. I've known him for a long time, and he's trying to be cute and trying to be funny. And you know, he's out there pitching. He's trying to get on to the main stage. He's got, you know, not a lot of time to do. And I actually found it to be fun. I like Chris. I always have,
But as it relates to law enforcement and the climate in the country, do you think that Black Lives Matter is dangerous when or...
I don't know that. I can't answer that question. No. But, again, who knows what's going. All I know is that the police are tremendous people. And, yes, you will have some bad ones as you do any profession and any, you know, walk of life. But the police are tremendous people. They do, overall, a tremendous job. And they have to be allowed to do their job.
Thank you, Donald Trump.
Thank you very much, Don.
What are Trump supporters looking for? What are they hearing from him that they don't hear from others in GOP?
Well, I think that, more than anything else, they want to see us become great again. It's my theme, my whole theme is, "Make America Great Again." It's a concept of greatness for this country. They are tired of being ripped off by every single country that does business with us. Whether it's China, Japan, Mexico, Vietnam -- which is in there big and heavy right now -- Japan with the cars. And you know, the one-way street. They're tired of looking at what happens, they are tired of us having our... let's say finest and brightest not being involved in the most important decisions, and being someplace else. They want to see great trade deals, they want to see a strong military. They want to see reduced debt, because we are at a point where we are going to be soon at $19 trillion and they just, you know, they can't stand seeing it. They want to see our veterans taken care of, because they are not, they are being absolutely mistreated. There are many things they want to see. There are many points of anger in this country.
People say they are sick of today's corrupt politicians. Are politicians really worse than before, or are voters nostalgic for post-war growth and prosperity?
Well, they're looking at the politicians as being all talk, no action. They talk the big game, then they go to Washington, they look at the magnificent hallowed halls as you would say, or the beautiful vaulted ceilings and they say, "darling, I've arrived, " to their loved one or their wife. They say "darling, I've arrived " and all of a sudden they become nothing. They become nothingness and they don't do the job that they got elected to do. And it happens time and time again. And people are tired of seeing politicians as all talk and no action. They just don't get it done. They are tired of being out-negotiated on every front. Whether it is militarily, with ISIS where we can't stop ISIS, where we have 2,300 Humvees, the latest and the greatest, armour-plated, stolen because one bullet is shot in the air and the allies run and the enemy takes over our weapons. Including 2,300 Humvees, which is incredible when you think of the number of them. I thought, there must be a mistake, it is 2,300.
To take trade, first of all, the pessimistic view is that America simply faces much more global competition, so America doesn't have as much leverage as it used to.
We have the cards, and I'll go into that in a second. We have politicians that are grossly incompetent. We have leaders that are incompetent and we have negotiators that are incompetent. You notice that I have Carl Icahn ready to go out and do battle. And I have many others that are great negotiators, ready to go out and do battle on our behalf. And by the way, we'll get along better with these countries in the end than we get along with them now. We have, as in the case of China and so many others, they don't even like us and yet they are eating our lunch in trade. So, with China, their primary weapon in China is what they've done with the devaluation of their currency. And in the trade pact you know that was recently agreed to, I said you have to talk about devaluation. Because that's been their single greatest asset in terms of what they are doing to us. And even just a week ago, they devalued it, the biggest devaluation they've had in two decades, two decades, that's a long time. And nobody thought they were going to devalue again because of the fact that you know just nobody thought... because they have been playing the devaluation game for a long time. Without us, they would... We rebuilt China, we rebuilt other places but we rebuilt China. The money they took out of the United States is the greatest theft in the history of our country. The money they've taken out, the jobs they've taken out, the base. You know, the whole thing. They have taken so much out of our country. And they have rebuilt China. Now, China has other problems, but the devaluation has allowed them to make it impossible for us to compete.
On China. The counter-argument from big CEOs, friends of yours, would be, look at last week when Apple stock was being hammered, how did the CEO stop that slide? He emailed CNBC to say our Chinese sales are strong, and that was enough to regain $66bn in value. What does that say about leverage?
Well, sure, sure, I'd like to see Apples built in the United States, not built in China. I'd like to see them have factories in the United States. At least, partially. They make nothing in the United States, virtually. I would like to see with Japan... two weeks ago I was in Los Angeles. I saw the biggest ships you have ever seen with cars pouring off from Japan, into Los Angeles. Just pouring off these ships, and I am saying to myself, we send them beef, it's a tiny fraction, and, by the way, they don't even want it, they have to fight in order to take it in because they don't even want it, and it's very perishable, they'll send it back, they'll find reasons not to take it. And yet the ships, the boats, the ships are loaded up with cars, thousands of cars and they are just pouring off. And I say, isn't that a shame, it's so one-sided. Now you look at Mexico. Many, many factories, many plants. Nabisco's now moving to Mexico, their big Chicago plant. You look at Ford is building one of their biggest factories in Mexico, one of their biggest assembly plants in Mexico. They are doing a two and a half billion dollar plant, that by the way is a major plant, two and a half billion dollars. They're doing a two and a half billion dollar plant. A plant, an auto, another foreign company was going to build a plant in Tennessee and they're now as you know going to Mexico, it was a big shock right at the end it was all set to be signed and they said right at the last moment oh we're going to Mexico. So Mexico is not only beating us at the border, they are also beating us at trade.
What would you say to the boss of Apple to make him move production, what if he says China is his best market?
So I have a friend who is a great manufacturer, and he deals with China. He deals with many countries, but he deals with China all the time. He said it is impossible, it is so hard to do business in there, it's so hard to get my goods into China. And he makes a great product, OK? It doesn't matter, I don't want to embarrass him, but he makes a great product. And he said it's so hard to get our goods into China. And when we do get in they charge us a huge surtax. They call it a surtax or a tariff. I call it a tax, OK? But when we do get in, and the number he gave was so high that it almost seemed ridiculous, it was over 40%, four-oh, and he said, these people are absolutely killing us because they send their stuff tax-free no problem, don't worry about it. But if we want to do business over there... And look at Boeing where they took all of their copyrights, and all of their patents in order to buy planes, they said but we want -- because they're going to make their own factories now, they're building them now, they are going to build their own planes -- but they took... and even if Boeing didn't give it they'd have copied it, because they've been very lax.
So you would put tariffs on Chinese imports?
No, unless... Here's what I would do. I would tell them, you have devalued your currency yet again; it is not going to happen. The value of that is the equivalent of a 7% tax or a 12% tax. Because of the fact that you have done that we are going to charge you 12% coming in. And you know what? They're going to stop playing games with us. Look, they have taken our jobs, they have taken our money, and on top of that they have loaned the money to us and we actually pay them interest now on money. We owe China and Japan each $1.4 trillion.
You'd make that threat to China?
It wouldn't be a threat. It would be a beyond a threat. And if they continue to do... because they're killing us. If you look at Caterpillar now (in Japan) with what's going on. Abe is a great leader. Who is our chief negotiator? Essentially it is Caroline Kennedy. I mean give me a break. She doesn't even know she's alive. It's Caroline Kennedy. So Caterpillar is having a hard time selling because Komatsu is under-cutting them. Japan is doing a big number on the yen, devaluing it, and it's very... I don't know if you have heard me say this story, but a friend of mine he's an excavator, he owns a big excavation company. And he buys a lot of excavators, earth-moving equipment. And for the first time in his life he bought Komatsu. He said Caterpillar can't compete because they have so killed the yen. And he feels very unhappy about it. It's a nice machine, but it is not probably as good but it's pretty close. And he said, I bought Komatsu tractors because nobody could compete with the price because of the fact... because of the dollar. It has nothing to do with the machinery, it is just that they have devalued the yen to such an extent that he said, he can't compete. So he ended up buying Komatsu and he is very unhappy about it. That's happening, by the way, that's happening more and more.
If the terms of trade can be changed, as you say, why haven't today's politicians of either party done it?
Because they're grossly incompetent. And they are not negotiators. And they are grossly incompetent. And I have friends from China -- by the way I love China. I love Japan. I have people that buy my apartments, I have people that work for me from China. I love Mexico. I mean, Mexico, I have thousands of people from Mexico that work for me. Thousands. Hispanics. In fact a poll just came out, Public Policy Polling, where I am leading with Hispanics, can you believe that, after what you have been hearing? I'm leading, I'm number one with Hispanics.
Do you like the label economic nationalist? Some people use that about you.
No, I don't think so, because it sounds too harsh. I just want to be fair. I want to be a fair trader. I want to be a firm and fair trader. We're being taken advantage of because we have leaders who are incompetent. They don't even know. When I went out and told them three months ago, you know in their trade deal they didn't even discuss the devaluation, they didn't even discuss it. At least they started discussing it, only because of me. They didn't even have it as part of their deal, I don't think they still do. But at least it got discussed. And a group came to me, a very important group, and they said could we do a commercial. They actually did a commercial where they actually paid for it, talking about what I was saying about trade. Because, you know what I'm talking about? You know, I did a commercial four months ago for them? I was the voice of the commercial. They asked me would I do it, and I said I'd gladly do it. They didn't even want my money, they had all the money... I talked about the devaluation that was the primary point of the commercial, that the trade deal was no good, number one. No good for us, good for them. So what happens is; we have tremendous strength, because they want to take our money. We have the money, we have the market. They want to take this from us. And because of that we have tremendous power. The problem is, we have leaders and negotiators that don't realise we have the power. And they're essentially incompetent. And we would be able to straighten out that thing. China only did the biggest devaluation in 20 years, only for one reason. Because they could get away with it.
Are you pointing to a bigger problem for Republicans, that they are very good at populist attacks on Barack Obama and firing people up about Washington not looking out for the middle class, but their policies are the same old Chamber of Commerce priorities?
Well, I can tell you, some of the people I'm running against don't have a clue as to -- we're talking now Republicans -- as to what to do about what we are talking about, devaluations. And I do. That's what I do, and I am really good at this stuff. I will make great deals with China and they will like us more than they do now. You know they don't even like us. You know in Businessweek magazine, they did a story a while ago about one of the ten things that the Chinese most want. One of the ten things was "Anything Trump". And I thought about that. And they respect me. They have to respect you. China does not respect us and they don't respect our leaders. I have done great in China.
What would President Trump do about China building reefs and air bases in the South China Sea?
Well, I don't like it, it's very far away. I do not like it. It's very hostile. It's a hostile move. And I would be talking to them very seriously about it. However, it is very far away, and we have a lot of problems, OK? And they're already built. And to be honest with you I think Japan and other people are going to have to start talking about things like that. I'll give you another example, the Ukraine. Russia's fighting in the Ukraine and we are right out front. We are right out front and we are sending brand-new F-22 fighters, the latest and the greatest, and everything else. And here's Germany that's making a fortune, and all of these European countries, who truly have a much bigger impact and effect than we do and are affected far greater than we are. And they just sit back and watch us go out there and put our heads on the line. And another thing is South Korea. I just ordered 4000 television sets from South Korea, you know. They are only made in South Korea, other than Sony. You know, Samsung, LG, Sharp. They're all South Korean. So I'm a negotiator, I made a deal, I made a good deal, it's fine, you know. I ordered 4,000. There's no televisions made in the United States. So I'm ordering 4,000 television sets from South Korea, and yet they are making a fortune as a country -- you look at the balance, you look at the deficits we have with all of these countries. We have deficits with everybody. Who do we have a positive with? We have deficits with everybody. So I ordered all of these sets and I'm thinking to myself, this is ridiculous. We don't even make televisions here. Now, when North Korea rears its head, we send our ships, we send our planes, we get ready, we got our 28,000 soldiers on the border, that's a seriously dangerous border by the way, they've got their million and a half man army and we have 28,000 soldiers. But here we are, doing this, protecting, and I am saying to myself, we don't even get money; we don't get anything for doing this.
You're surely right that lots of American presidents are frustrated by wimpy, free-loading allies. But what if they don't step up?
By the way, I don't mind being at their side, with respect to the Ukraine. But why should we always be out front? How many times can we be out in front on these issues? We just mentioned four of them in a minute and a half. You mention the South China Sea, we mention North Korea, South Korea, we mention Ukraine. We could mention five others. Yemen, and this, and that. How many places can we do this? We have a country that is a debtor nation, we have an infrastructure that is crumbling all over the place, 60% of the bridges we have in this country are in trouble.
Lots of Americans share your frustration. But what if the allies don't step up, and China and Russia start bullying their neighbours?
If we step back they will protect themselves very well. Remember when China... Japan used to beat China routinely in wars. You know that, right? Japan used to beat China, they routinely beat China. Why are we defending? You know the pact we have with Japan is interesting. Because if somebody attacks us, Japan does not have to help. If somebody attacks Japan, we have to help Japan. That's the kind of deals we make. And that's why I am at 40%. The new Gravis poll just came out at 40% by the way.
Would you consider revisiting the treaty with Japan?
Why is it, I ask you this, why is it that if somebody hits us they do not have to come to our aid in any way, shape or form? But if they get hit we are mandatory, we have to come to their aid.
Now, lots of your GOP rivals would look at the rise of ISIS and say they are not frightened of America, and that's Obama's fault
True.
And the next thing they would say is, regrettably America is going to have to play cop again and sort out the Middle East. Do you think America has any business sorting out the Middle East?
I think we should keep the oil.
How do you keep that oil?
You take the oil. It's simple. You take the oil. There are certain areas which ISIS has the oil and you take the oil, you keep it. You just go in and take it.
And would you have American troops guarding that?
Yes, we could do that very easily. And yet I get criticised by some people, and some people love it. We cannot continue to be a policeman for the rest of the world. We are a debtor nation, and we owe now $19 trillion and it's going to go up very fast by the way from this point. We're up to almost $19 trillion. We can't be the policeman for the rest of the world.
Just to be clear, would you have American forces guarding that oil?
Yes, I would have American forces guarding the oil, absolutely. Nobody is going to take it back. Without our very strong approval. Nobody else is taking it back.
Do Americans look at the Middle East and a decade of war and think it is beyond fixing?
No, I think ISIS has overplayed its hand. You have to understand, I was totally against the war in Iraq, you can check Reuters, July of oh-four, I was against it, I said you are going to destabilise... So I am the most militaristic person but you have to know when to use the military. Or have it so strong that nobody is going to mess with you, which is my ultimate goal, to be honest with you. Because our military has been greatly weakened by a lot of bad decisions and other things. But anyway, but I was against the war with Iraq. First of all, they didn't knock down the World Trade Centre. It wasn't Iraq that knocked down the World Trade Centre. If you look at where the people sent their families, you know where it was, it wasn't Iraq, ok? So it wasn't Iraq. They didn't send their families home to Iraq. In fact out of the 18 or so I think none went to Iraq. So it was not Iraq that knocked down the World Trade Centre. I said in 2004 -- I brought that up as a point by the way -- but I said, in fact a group was sent to me from the White House to try talk to me, because I was getting a lot of publicity. I seem to get a lot of publicity for whatever reason. But I said you shouldn't do it, it was actually in 2003 I said it, which was early enough. But I said it in 2004, you're going to destabilise the Middle East, Iran is going to take over Iraq... and somebody else is going to help and that turned out to be ISIS. It's an exact... I wish you could read, I'd send you the article if you want it, but it's in, it's Reuters of July of 2004.
Back in 2003 and 2004 what did you make of those calling for building Western-style democracies around the world? Should America be nation-building?
We should be building a nation and it should be called the United States of America. That's the nation we should be building. We are spending all our money nation-building in other places and they don't even want us. Now, with that being said, we cannot allow, you know I told you we shouldn't have gone into Iraq. Look, Iraq and Iran would fight for years and years and years, it went on forever. They were almost identical strengths, and the line would never move, right? Then they would go home and rest for ten years and then they would start fighting and they'd rest, that was it. We knocked out one of those two pegs, and so now Iran is taking over. I mean, what Iran is going to do with all of the money they are getting. That's another thing, the deal is so stupid. Your name is David, right? David, the deal with Iran is so stupid, it's so insanely stupid, that when people vote for me, they know I don't make deals like that. I get our prisoners back, I don't have 24 day inspection periods, I don't have self-inspection where they inspect themselves, I don't give them $150 billion that they can use for terrorism all over the world. I would have doubled up and tripled up the sanctions and made a good deal. I like the idea of a deal, it's got to be a good deal. So when you say, why do people like me, they like me for reasons like that. Because I don't make deals like that. I don't make a deal with Sergeant Bergdahl, where we get Bergdahl, a traitor, and they get their five people that they most wanted. Five for one.
And who are the disenfranchised that you see at your rallies? What is the Trump coalition?
I'm going to go by polls. A recent poll came out in New Hampshire where I'm at 35%, to (others on) 11 and 9 and 2 and 3 and 1. And don't forget, that's with 17. How about getting 35% with 17 people? Ok. That's a very lot of people. When I started, before I announced I was at 3% and they said, "Oh, well that's his cap, " 3%. Then I announced I went to 9%, then it went to 18%. Every time I went up they said "Oh well, that's his cap, that's his cap." The next week, "That's his cap, that's his cap." Well, then I had 35%. They said, "Well, we might as well not say that anymore, " because 35, that's an awfully high number. But when they did a poll, they were shocked. Because they thought I'd do well with Tea Party, they thought I'd do well with... but I do, I do great with Tea Party, I do great with conservatives I do great with moderates, I do great with evangelicals, I do great with everybody. It's across the board and that's what people are most surprised at. It's not just with one group. We do great with people across the board, David... And we do great with African Americans, because they know I'm going to... and today we have a poll come out where I actually do great with Hispanics. Public Policy Polling.
And with all these groups, do they have one thing in common, that similar forces have hurt them?
They have been disenfranchised. Look at evangelicals, you can't even use the word "Christmas " any more, Macy's doesn't use the word "Christmas". I mean you can't even use the word "Christmas " anymore. And you know, with me, it is going to stop, it is going to stop, and they understand that.
Who has had the rawest of raw deals?
I think hard-working, great people in the United States have been disenfranchised. People, I'll give you an example, it has always been the way to do it, to work hard, save your money, put your money in the bank, get interest on your money and retire wealthy, at least modestly wealthy. Well, the people that have done that have been hurt terribly because there is no interest on your money. You get no money. I just signed for some CDs where you are getting a quarter of one percent. A quarter of one percent! They don't even want your money, the banks. So the people that did it the way they were supposed to do it, the way they were taught in school: save your money, so that when you retire... you understand. They get nothing. They have nothing. They were going to live off the interest of the money. They don't have money. And then on top of it you had the problems of nine years ago with the mortgages so half of them their houses have been taken away. The many -- and by the way, white, black, Asian, it covers everybody. Evangelicals, conservatives, Tea Partyers. Everybody has been hurt by the incompetent way that our government is run. By incompetent negotiators.
What do you make of the fact that pundits predicted that this election would be all about inequality, then a billionaire can come in and sweep the field?
Well, I actually think this election is going to be about competence. I'm a very competent person, ok? And this election, you know, a woman came up, there was a CNN poll where I lead by four times in leadership, I lead on economics -- your magazine, right? -- I lead big on finance and economics and the economy, big, big, like everybody else was 7, 8, I was 48, and they're like nothing by comparison. I lead on almost every kind... The only one I didn't lead on was niceness. And that one I wasn't even close to the top. And I actually said, I really think I am a nice person. But I said to the person that's doing it. I was number one in the poll by far, but the one weakness I had was niceness. And I said, this is not going to be an election on niceness. This is going to be an election on competence. People are tired, and I believe that, I believe more than anything else, and part of that goes to what you just said. Because those are people that are being disenfranchised. Everything has been taken away.
Is it going to be a bit about inequality?
Inequality is going to be a big issue, but competence is going to be the biggest issue. They want to see somebody that's super-competent and that's me.
On inequality, you have said you'd look at carried interest deductions, taxes on the super-rich?
I didn't say the super-rich, I said hedge-fund guys. I know hedge-fund guys that are making hundreds of millions of dollars a year and pay no tax. And I want to lower (tax) for the middle income. The middle class in this country has been decimated, David, decimated. I know hedge fund guys, they're friends of mine, they pay no tax, they pay very little tax.
So would you end the carried-interest deduction?
Well, you may have to. And you certainly may have to for certain businesses. As an example, when a hedge-fund guy gets lucky because the market goes up, and he is going to make $200m, and you know $200 million, and he is going to pay almost no tax. I don't think that is a good thing for the country, and you know, hey look, they are all supporting Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton, all the hedge-fund guys. I don't want their support, because I'm totally self-funding my campaign. I don't need anybody's money, it's nice, you know? I'm totally self-funding my campaign, and the people like that, because you know, when they come to me after an election, where you win, and they say will you keep my taxes low? Or will you give us insurance here? Or do this or that or a thousand different things, or the lobbyists. I turned down five million dollars from a lobbyist who wanted to put up $5m for my campaign, a very strong lobbyist. I said, I don't want your money.
Would a President Trump pass new laws on campaign finance? Or is the trick having a president too rich to be bribed? Would you try to reform the system?
I think you need clarity with financing. I do think this. I think that you need clarity, you have to be able to see who's giving. You don't even see that any...you don't even see that. Because some of these things they put up on there, nobody knows who they are, where they are coming from etc etc. You need clarity. You have to be able to see, I don't like restriction but I do want clarity.
Was Citizens United a bad ruling for democracy?
Well, it's not good for me, because these guys are raising a lot of money in PACs and SuperPACs and although I know a lot of PACs have been set up, I know nothing about them. I know a lot of PACs where people like me so much. I understand that there is five or six PACs that have formed in order to, you know... I am not involved. As you know I am not allowed to be involved. But I know that there have been some PACs formed in order to... they call them, like, Trump PACs. But I don't even know who. I saw on television the other day, two young guys, they formed a PAC, essentially a Trump PAC, they like Trump. But the truth is, I think that if money comes in, you should be able to spend your own money and do what you have to do. But there has to be clarity as to who is giving the money.
You have started talking about law and order a lot, and scrutiny of the police. Do you think that explains some of the rise of murder rates in some cities?
We have to bring back law and order in this country and I think the police are phenomenal people. I think there's always bad apples, and I've seen things that I don't like and you don't like. But we have to bring back law and order. You have policemen now that are afraid to talk to anybody because they don't want to lose their job.
How bad is the situation?
I think it is very bad. I think when you have Baltimore, which in the first night was practically wiped out or brought back 30 years. Because the police were instructed to stand down. You can't let that happen.
Has Obama used race to get involved in that stuff?
Totally. Obama is the great divider, he has totally used race. And it should have been the other way around. He had an opportunity to unify and he didn't do that.
How would you describe race relations in 2015 in Obama's America?
Almost as bad as they have ever been in the history of the country.
Where do you think it is going wrong?
You see it, you see it, we are sitting on many powder kegs. Whether it's Ferguson, or St Louis, or like the other night, or Baltimore. Or different parts of Chicago.
What do think could happen?
I think there are powder kegs ready to explode.
Who's going to be leading the explosion? Do you think African-Americans are ready to explode?
People. People....No, I think various places in this country are ready to explode. You asked about race relations, I think they're very tense. I think that Obama has divided the country as far as race relations are concerned, and I think that you have certain sections, and you have lots of different locations within this country that potentially are powder kegs.
What did you think of his response to the murders in Charleston, his response to the confederate flag issue and his eulogy?
I thought his speech was good... Is that the one where he sang? I thought that was a good speech.
Were you pleased to see those confederate flags coming down from those poles?
Well, a lot of people are looking at that as a freedom of expression. And I hate to do anything that is going to stop or suppress free speech.
What happened to the idea of conservative purity and primaries from the right? Are conservatives giving you a pass on issues where you are not on the right, because they love you on other things? Why are you immune to this purity test?
I'm strongly into the Bible; I'm strongly into God and religion. I'm pro-life and different things. But I think they view me as somebody that can straighten out the country. And they view other people as wimps that can't do it. And they look at my track record, I built up an amazing company, I don't know if you looked at my filings, most people don't even know how big they are. But I built up a net worth of much more than $10 billion, net worth, that means net worth. I built a great company, I have some of the most iconic assets, like even the Bank of America building in San Francisco, nobody even knew that until they saw the filing. A big chunk of it. The 1290 Avenue of the Americas, Trump Tower, 40 Wall St, many, many pieces of land all over the United States, in the best locations, on rivers, oceans and lakes. Like in Los Angeles, phenomenal land on the Pacific Ocean. You know, on the Potomac River, I have land. I own Doral, I own Turnberry in Scotland, one of the great resorts of the world. I own, you know, not just assets, I own the great assets, I own some of the greatest assets in the world. And people see that, and that gives you a lot of credibility. They have seen how I have done. By the way, as you know, I have never gone bankrupt, or close. But I use the bankruptcy laws, but so does everybody else. Everybody does it. Unfortunately when they use it they don't get... I guess I get more publicity, who knows? But when I use it they say "oh look, what he did." And I have used it, you know, very sparingly. So out of hundreds of deals I used it four times, so big deal? I actually did a deal, David, it was interesting, a friend of mine was in trouble, I bought his company for nothing, I called the banks and I said do you want to make a deal? Before I made the deal, I said you want to make a deal? No, we don't want to do it, Donald. I knew the banks, you see. I said you are making a big mistake. Well, then I bought the company, I then said, are you sure you don't want to do it? I chaptered it, and knocked the hell out of them. I made a great deal out of it, bought it for nothing, made a great deal out of it. But there was an article, oh Trump went bankrupt, and I never went bankrupt, you understand what I am saying?
Yes, yes, these are legal things...
I'm using the laws of the nation to my benefit. And I should do that, it's to my benefit. Now, when, if I am running the country I will use that same ability that I have, because I have always had the ability to make a lot of money. I'll use that same ability to make our nation rich again, because it sounds like, not nice, some people said, oh that's a harsh word, "rich". Well, until we are rich, you know this better with of your magazine, we can't be great again until we are rich, because right now we are a debtor nation, our airports are third world, our highways are falling apart. Our roads, our bridges, everything, we're like third world.
Other Republican candidates talk about red tape; you're talking about bigger things.
Well, I talk about... now, regulation's another thing. We are being regulated to a point that we can't move. So that's another thing. But honestly I think I am talking about an even bigger picture. But that's a big thing... regulation, also, we will get rid of a lot of it.
Well, thanks very much.
When is this story coming out?
Joined now by Donald Trump. Donald Trump, welcome back to the Hugh Hewitt Show, it's always a pleasure to talk to you.
Thank you, Hugh.
I would thought that today, this is our sixth interview, I'd turn to some of the commander-in-chief questions. Are you ready for that?
OK, fine.
Are you familiar with General Soleimani?
Yes, but go ahead, give me a little, go ahead, tell me.
He runs the Quds Forces.
Yes, OK, right.
Do you expect his behavior...
The Kurds, by the way, have been horribly mistreated by...
No, not the Kurds, the Quds Forces, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Quds Forces.
Yes, yes.
... is the bad guys.
Right.
Do you expect his behavior to change as a result...
Oh, I thought you said Kurds, Kurds.
No, Quds.
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you said Kurds, because I think the Kurds have been poorly treated by us, Hugh. Go ahead.
Agreed. So Soleimani runs the Quds Forces. Do you expect his behavior is going to change as a result of this deal with Iran?
I think that Iran right now is in the driver's seat to do whatever they want to do. I think what's happening with Iran is, I think it's one of the, and I covered it very well. I assume you saw the news conference. I think Iran is, it's one of the great deals ever made for them. I think it's one of the most incompetent contracts I've even seen. I'm not just talking about defense. I'm not talking about a contract with another country. I've never seen more of a one-sided deal, I think, in my life, absolutely.
Well, Soleimani is to terrorism sort of what Trump is to real estate.
OK.
Many people would say he's the most dangerous man in the world, and he runs the Quds Forces, which is their Navy SEALs.
Is he the gentleman that was going back and forth with Russia and meeting with Putin? I read something, and that seems to be also where he's at.
That's the guy.
He's going back and forth meeting with other countries, etc., etc.
That's the guy.
Not good.
And so do you think...
Not good for us. And what it shows is a total lack of respect, I mean, that the other countries would even be entertaining him, and they're entertaining him big league, big league.
So when you went before the Senate, and I always tell people my favorite testimony of all time is when Donald Trump just schooled the Senate on the construction of the U.N. remodel.
Right.
You know that stuff. You know every developer in Manhattan. You know everything about building buildings. You could build the wall. I have no doubt about that.
Right. By the way, and nobody knows how easy that would be. And I mean, it would be, it would be tall, it would be powerful, we would make it very good looking. It would be as good as a wall's got to be, and people will not be climbing over that wall, believe me. Go ahead.
You know, I'd buy that, because you're a builder. But on the front of Islamist terrorism, I'm looking for the next commander-in-chief, to know who Hassan Nasrallah is, and Zawahiri, and al-Julani, and al-Baghdadi. Do you know the players without a scorecard, yet, Donald Trump?
No, you know, I'll tell you honestly, I think by the time we get to office, they'll all be changed. They'll be all gone. I knew you were going to ask me things like this, and there's no reason, because number one, I'll find, I will hopefully find General Douglas MacArthur in the pack. I will find whoever it is that I'll find, and we'll, but they're all changing, Hugh. You know, those are like history questions. Do you know this one, do you know that one. I will tell you, I thought you used the word Kurd before. I will tell you that I think the Kurds are the most under-utilized and are being totally mistreated by us. And nobody understands why. But as far as the individual players, of course I don't know them. I've never met them. I haven't been, you know, in a position to meet them. If, if they're still there, which is unlikely in many cases, but if they're still there, I will know them better than I know you.
That's what I'm getting at, because the Islamist extremism is metastasizing. Nasrallah's been there a long time, and al-Baghdadi's running ISIS. And so I wonder if you're going to throw yourself into the details of this during the campaign the way you did into the U.N. deal, because you knew that stuff cold.
Well, you know, and unfortunately, I said I'd build it for $500 million. They were at $3 billion. And it ended up costing $6 billion, and I told them that would happen. And it was a disgrace. Frankly, that whole U.N. situation was a disgrace. They ended up spending $5-6 billion dollars to renovate a building that I would have done for $500 million, and I told them I would have done it, and it would have been better. Now as far as what you're talking about now, I will know every detail, and I will have the right plan, not a plan like this where we're probably going backwards based on everything that I'm hearing, but we're probably going backwards, zero respect. We have, we are not a respected country, and certainly as it relates to ISIS and what's going on, and Iran.
Now I don't believe in gotcha questions. And I'm not trying to quiz you on who the worst guy in the world is.
Well, that is a gotcha question, though. I mean, you know, when you're asking me about who's running this, this this, that's not, that is not, I will be so good at the military, your head will spin. But obviously, I'm not meeting these people. I'm not seeing these people. Now it probably will be a lot of changes, Hugh, as you go along. They'll be, by the time we get there, which is still a pretty long period of time, you know, you start, let's say you figure out nominations, and who is going to represent the Republicans in, let's say, February, March, April, you'll start to get pretty good ideas, maybe sooner than that, actually. But that will be a whole new group of people. I think what is really important is to pick out, and this is something I'm so good at, to pick out who is going to be the best person to represent us militarily, because we have some great people, militarily. I don't know that we're using them.
All right, well, let me expand it, because you know, it's not gotcha. I'm trying not to do that. But I wanted to see if you...
Well, it sounded like gotcha. You're asking me names that, I think it's somewhat ridiculous, but that's OK. Go ahead, let's go.
All right, good. Now have you ever been to Israel? And how often?
Yes, I've been to Israel once.
And if Israel acts unilaterally against Iran because they view this deal as so bad, will you unequivocally stand by the action of the Netanyahu government?
Of course, I will. In fact, he's a friend of mine. I did commercials for his reelection. And according to what he said, I'm the only celebrity, he's used the word celebrity, this was a while ago, that did commercials, that he asked to do commercials. But he's a good man, and I would absolutely stand with him. But you know, we have a problem, because according to the deal, and this is hard to believe, but we're supposed to be protecting Iran against any invader. And if Israel invades, nobody knows exactly what's going to happen, because if Israel invades Iran, I don't know if you know, but we have a clause in that agreement that the way I read it, it's almost like we have to go, and by the way, I can guarantee you that clause, first of all, should have never been there, maybe they had it taken out, but we didn't win anything. But do you know there's a clause in there that in theory, we're supposed to help them fight Israel?
Yup. Yeah, it's in Annex Three. We agree to cooperate in the security of their nuclear installations. It's remarkable, and I'm glad you know about it. And I'm glad you'll stand with Israel. Let me ask you about Saudi Arabia and Egypt. I don't know if you've been able to get to those countries, yet, have you?
I have, yes.
And so do you...
Well, I think the biggest, you know, I think it's terrible, first of all, with Egypt, and with Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia in particular, was making a billion dollars a day, one billion dollars a day. Now let's say they make half of that number because oil prices have been so depressed. But Saudi Arabia was making a half a billion dollars. It was a billion dollars a day. Why aren't they helping us out? When they asked, and you may not like this, but I like it, because when we owe now $19, we're up to $19 trillion dollars, I certainly like it, and I like protecting... why aren't they helping us with the costs? We get virtually nothing from Saudi Arabia. Every time somebody raises a rifle in the air and points it in the direction of Saudi Arabia, or, by the way, South Korea and other places, every single time that happens, and I mean without exception, we start loading up and getting ready and sending ships and sending all sorts of things. We get nothing. And you know, maybe you'll explain why, but we get nothing. And I don't like that.
I'm curious, though, if we need them, in your opinion, as strategic allies -- Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan. Do we need them even if they're not paying us money for their defense?
Well, you need, I think Egypt and Israel get along, and they're starting to get along pretty well. Mubarak should have been frankly, probably, taken care of better than he was. That sent a bad signal around. But I think in terms of Israel, Egypt starts getting very important. Maybe we don't need the oil to the same extent as we did, and pretty soon, if we allowed, if we allowed what we have, technologically, to go forward, we wouldn't need them at all. You know, we have potentially the greatest oil reserves in the world right here, and we wouldn't need them at all. You know, we used to need Saudi Arabia for oil, and that part of the world. It all started with the oil, and it sort of ends with the oil. But now, we're at a point where we're going to be doing ten million barrels. It's very interesting. We're probably, very soon, if we allow our people to get going, we're probably not going to need them for the oil. So we don't need Saudi Arabia nearly to the extent that we needed them in the past.
OK, looking to Asia, if China were to either accidentally or intentionally sink a Filipino or Japanese ship, what would Commander-In-Chief Donald Trump do in response?
I wouldn't want to tell you, because frankly, they have to, you know, somebody wrote a very good story about me recently, and they said there's a certain unpredictable, and it was actually another businessman, said there's a certain unpredictability about Trump that's great, and it's what made him a lot of money and a lot of success. You don't want to put, and you don't want to let people know what you're going to do with respect to certain things that happen. You don't want the other side to know. I don't want to give you an answer to that. If I win, and I'm leading in every single poll, if I win, I don't want people to know exactly what I'm going to be doing.
Fair response. Good response.
Part of the problem with Obama, he says we're going to do this, we're going to do that, we're going to attack here, we're going to do this. Every time they capture somebody, they make a big deal out of it, and all of the other people, like for instance, they hit somebody with a drone, and they start making a big deal over the fact that they took out a mid-level accounting person, and now everybody else goes and runs, and it makes it harder. I don't want to explain, and I think it's a very bad thing. I think we do too much talking, and not enough, do you understand what I'm saying in this, Hugh?
Oh, it's a great point. It's a very good answer.
We do too much talking. General Douglas MacArthur, I was watching as President Obama was talking about, I won't go into great detail, was talking about attacking at a certain time in a certain place, and I'm saying can you imagine General Douglas MacArthur, General Patton, they must be spinning in their graves when they hear it. So when you tell me a ship is attacked, I don't want to tell you exactly what I'm going to do. I don't want people to know my thinking on that, and I do have very spoken... thinking on it.
Fair play.
But I don't want people to know my thinking.
All right, next question. Presidents respond to disasters. Governors respond to disasters. What disasters have you, Donald Trump, responded to?
Well, I've responded very much to disasters. I've had, you know, fires in buildings, big buildings. I've had economic changes where the world crashed in the early 90s, and I came out stronger than I was before. And I didn't go bankrupt like many people they were forced into bankruptcy, and they were forced into, like, you know disasters never to be heard from again. I came out stronger than I was before. There was an old expression in the early 90s -- survive'til '95 that I made up, and I gave. And I actually became much stronger. But I've gone through, I've watched economic problems happen. Eight years ago, nine years ago when I was buying and everybody else was selling because they had no money and I did have a lot of money and I bought a lot of great assets. And you know, I've gone through a lot of different things, and I've come out on top always.
Very good. Now some political questions. Do you own a gun?
I do.
What kind?
I'd rather not say.
OK.
I have a license to carry. I have a license, you know, I have a concealed license, I have a license to carry concealed.
Didn't know that. How do you define assault weapon? This is important to our 2nd Amendment friends out there.
Well, yeah, I think that you know, the word assault weapon, and a lot of people, there's been a lot of controversy, but I wouldn't give you exact, I am in favor, I have two sons that are members in very high standing at the NRA.
Right.
And I would ask them for a definition, but I am in favor of allowing, I'm very, very pro-2nd Amendment. And if you want to ask that, I would go to the experts. All I can tell you is that I am totally a 2nd Amendment person, and totally in favor of not doing anything. You know, an interesting thing happened. When the two prisoners escaped in upstate New York, Hugh, people that really were very much against guns all of a sudden, they have these two prisoners, and they are someplace up there and nobody knew where, and a woman who said she used to fight with her husband all the time, she didn't want guns, all of a sudden, they felt so safe because they were sitting with guns, and they were able to protect themselves. Now nothing ever happened, and ultimately, they caught the one and they killed the other. You know the case I'm talking about three months ago.
You bet.
But it was very interesting to watch this woman who was totally, and I mean absolutely totally against guns, and all of a sudden, she felt safe because they were able to have guns in the house. So it's interesting. No, I'm totally pro-2nd Amendment.
All right, now the age question. Hillary's had to face it. You should as well. You're 69. How's your health? And is it legitimate for people to worry about you being president at 69?
Well, my health is very good, and my father was 94. My mother was 89 when she passed away, and my father was in great shape until he was really like almost 90. My mother was in great shape almost until the end, and mentally, her capacity was 100%, so from a genetic standpoint, very good. I'm in the process of getting some documentation from doctors that have taken care of me over the years. I've never had a major problem. I've had almost no minor problem as I knock on wood. But my health has been very good and very strong. And maybe you get to see that, because people say boy, you have a lot of energy. You're able to do so many things. Don't forget, in addition to running a campaign where it's number one in every poll, I'm also running a business, which I'm rapidly giving over to my executives. I have a very big business, and I'm rapidly giving that over to my executives and my children.
All right, now every GOP candidate for high office gets this question, Meg Whitman most recently. It's the illegal alien employment question. Usually, about six weeks before an election, so Donald Trump, have you or any of close member of your family hired an illegal alien in close proximity to your family?
Not that I know of, no.
OK. Archbishop Chaput of Philadelphia blasted you yesterday without naming you -- he's a very well-respected Catholic cleric -- for belligerent bombast about illegal aliens. He's a man of the cloth. What do you say in response?
Well, I think that's fine. I mean, he can feel that way, and I understand that. And he's not the only one, but I feel we need borders. I feel that we have to, the word illegal means we're a country of laws. You saw that at my press conference today, and illegal means illegal. They're not supposed to be in the country. And we're either going to have a country or we're not. And if we're not going to have strong borders with a wall, which will make it very strong, by the way, and walls do work if they're properly built, not the little 11 foot walls that we have up right now, and they're not walls, they're fences. There is a difference. But you know, I can understand him saying that. And other people have said it, too. But I believe we either have a country or we don't. We either have laws in the country or we don't.
All right, now some personal stuff in our last few minutes, because people are curious about Donald Trump. What's your, what was your worst health crisis to date?
None. I mean, none. I really haven't had...
Wow, are you blessed. What's your worst business decision that you've made?
Worst business decision? Well, I've made some business decisions where markets changed, but in virtually every case, I was able to take those decisions and make them good, and take those jobs and make them good, which I think is a great test. I mean, I've had buildings going up and the market crashes, which is not my fault, and I go back and I negotiate with the banks, and I negotiate tough and I negotiate hard, and I've taken some jobs that were, that could have been disastrous and made them better than if the market had stayed the same. So I don't know, I view business, I view that question as something you have to learn from it, and you can never make a decision that's going to take you down. In other words, you're not going to do something that if it doesn't work out, because the best businessmen in the world, I know all of them, the best businessmen in the world have had difficult times, and they've had bad deals. And you can never allow a deal, Hugh, to take you down. You just can't do it. So you have to know what you're doing. But one of the things, and I get a lot of credit in the world of business, I've taken deals that should have been bad, and I've made them great, better than if the markets stayed good.
Made them work.
And I'll tell you one thing, I bought deals for very low prices, like recently Doonbeg in Ireland, this incredible piece of land on the Atlantic Ocean, and other things, I've taken deals and bought deals that, and I bought them for very low prices, and turned them around and made them fantastic. So you know, I think you have to learn from business, and ideally, you want to learn from other people, not from yourself.
All right, now President Obama is President Obama today, because when he ran for the United States Senate, his principal opponent, Jack Ryan, had divorce and custody records that had been sealed unsealed. Is there any smoking gun sealed away in records that could come out about Donald Trump down the road to destroy the Republican nominee after you're the nominee, if you're the nominee?
No, I don't think so, and I think one of the things you know about me, I've been a very public person. While I'm private, I've also been a very public person over many years. I mean, people know me. I'm very well known, and whether it's the great success on The Apprentice, where it was one of the top shows on television for a long time, and by the way, NBC renewed it, and is not in love with the fact that I didn't do it, but they renewed me for The Apprentice for many, many shows on The Apprentice, and you see the kind of money I made on The Apprentice, and I turned it down. I said I'm going to run for president, I'm going to make America great again. They were not happy that I did that, so they're stuck in limbo. But they renewed The Apprentice. I didn't do it. No, I think nothing. I'm a very public person, even though I'm private. I think you have seen me, and long before we met and spoke, you've seen me, and you know exactly what I'm talking about. So I would say nothing.
all right, last question, I want to go back to the beginning, because I really do disagree with you on the gotcha question thing, Donald Trump. At the debate, I may bring up Nasrallah being with Hezbollah, and al-Julani being with al-Nusra, and al-Masri being with Hamas. Do you think if I ask people to talk about those three things, and the differences, that that's a gotcha question?
Yes, I do. I totally do. I think it's ridiculous.
That's interesting. I just disagree with that. I kind of figured that...
All right, I think it's ridiculous. I'll have, I'm a delegator. I find great people. I find absolutely great people, and I'll find them in our armed services, and I find absolutely great people. And now on the bigger picture, like the fact that our Kurds are being treated so poorly, and would really is the one group that really would be out there fighting for us, I think, and fighting for themselves, maybe more importantly to them, I understand that. But when you start throwing around names of people and where they live and give me their address, I think it's ridiculous, and I think it's totally worthless.
Well, I wouldn't do that. That's crazy. I agree.
Well, and by the way, the names you just mentioned, they probably won't even be there in six months or a year.
I don't know. Nasrallah's got such staying power.
Well, let's see what happens.
And so I think the difference...
And you know what? In that case, first day in office, or before then, right at the day after the election, I'll know more about it than you will ever know. That I can tell you.
Oh, I hope so. Last question, so the difference between Hezbollah and Hamas does not matter to you yet, but it will?
It will when it's appropriate. I will know more about it than you know, and believe me, it won't take me long.
All right, that, I believe.
But right now, right now, I think it's just something that, and you know what, if you ask these candidates, nobody's going to be able to give you an answer. I mean, there may be one that studied it because they're expecting a fresh question from you. But believe me, it won't matter. I will know far more than you know within 24 hours after I get the job.
Donald Trump, congratulations on taking the pledge today. Your numbers are going to go up as a result of that.
Well, let's see what happens. I mean, I'm not sure that that's true. I think my numbers are very high now. But I'm not really sure that that's true, but I know you feel that. I hope you're right. I mean, let's see what happens.
So Donald, you said 16 other candidates. I think it is safe to say that you consider yourself a pretty good -- as having a pretty good eye for talent in competition. So is Ben Carson your No. 1 challenger? Who do you think is really actually going to give you some competition in this race?
I like Ben. We've had a great relationship. I like a lot of the others. I have great respect for some of the folks on the stage. I don't know -- I probably wouldn't want to say anyway. Frankly, I don't want to tell people who I think is the toughest one at this moment. That's not good. I'm supposed to be fighting these people and winning. I don't like to do that. But you have some good talent up there. You have some talented people. And many of them I like a lot. Many of them I respect a lot.
Not about the Quds force, but about the Iran deal. You're the only candidate in the field that I know of who has actually been forthright in saying that you would basically work with the Iran deal. You've said I've taken bad contracts my whole career and made them work. It sounds like you're prepared to accept this deal if it goes through and work to implement it, rather than trying to undo it. Have I got that right?
Well, do did -- You do have it right. And you know, by the way, when you said Quds versus Kurds, I thought he said Kurds, this third-rate radio announcer that I did the show -- it was like got you, got you -- every question was do I know this one and that one? It was like he worked hard on that. But I thought he said Kurds. I do think the Kurds --
That's right, Donald.
Don't forget, it was my dream to have just one nice editorial for Gene. He's actually given me a few. And this is far beyond expectations now.
But Donald, bottom line is, though, the Supreme Court makes a decision. That's the law of the land, right?
You have to go with it. You have to go with it. The decision has been made. And that is the law of the land.
What she did was clearly against the law.
And Gene, you know, she can take a pass and let somebody else in the office do it, in terms of religions. So it's a very tough situation. But we are a nation, as I said yesterday, we're a nation of laws. And I was talking about borders. I was talking about other things. But, you know, it applies to this also. And the Supreme Court has ruled. Would be nice to have other people in her office do what they have to do.
Donald, it sounds like you couldn't keep your eyes off Brit either.
Well, you know what? It was very interesting. When that happens, it's a good feeling because you have people that you do respect and when a thing like that happens and whether it's Brit or Gene or Alex or any of the people that you mentioned, you know, it makes you feel good because you're getting your point across and there are a lot of -- you know, there are a lot of problems in this country and they can be fixed. You know, I hate to use the word "again," but it's make America great again and that's what we have to do. The word "again" becomes very, very important.
We showed some polls -- the latest Monmouth poll -- that showed you beating everybody in the field except for Ben Carson who actually has a double digit lead over you. What do you want Republican voters to know about Ben Carson and why you would be a better president than he?
Well, I'm much better as a counter puncher, so I'd rather have -- and I'm hoping for Ben to really hit me at some point. Because I love to counter punch. And he's been very nice to me. He's actually a really nice guy. I like him. We get along very well -- as I do with most of the other people up on stage -- and it's interesting. But I think I'm probably going to wait. I do have certain things to say. But I'm not going to be saying them for a little while. Let's see what happens.
All right. So you're beating Jeb Bush by 20 points. You've said before that he is low energy. What if you win the nomination, would you ever consider Jeb Bush as your vice president?
I really don't want to talk about that because, you know -- Look, again, he's somebody I like and I respect. I really don't want to talk about that, though. It's too soon. I don't like to think about vice -- I have a big battle ahead of me. I have five months before it really starts in terms of, you know, in terms of what we're going through and in terms of Iowa where we start and then you go to New Hampshire and then South Carolina. I don't want to think in terms of vice president yet. It's just too early. But there are a lot of good people.
Well, Donald Trump, thank you very much. It's always great to have you on the show.
Well, thank you both. Thank you all. Appreciate it.
All right. Donald. Thank you so much. Always great talking you to.
Thank you very much.
Well, what would you have done? After the gas --
And you know, the amazing thing --
After the gas --
After the gas -- something should have happened because when they used gas --
What? What would you have done? In hindsight?
Probably, probably in retrospect, they should have gone in and they had should have done something with Assad. But, you know, Assad is not our biggest problem because Assad and ISIS are actually fighting.
Yes.
So now what we are doing is we are fighting ISIS and ISIS wants to fight Assad. And some people could why don't you just let them fight out and you take off the remnants. We're stopping -- Assad has to say these people are the nicest people on earth, they are fighting my enemy. But Assad has the benefit of having Russia and Iran protecting him and I have a feeling that probably --
All right.
These are people that are unfit to run for office in my opinion.
All right. If all lives matter then, why do you support Planned Parenthood and not cutting off the funding since they're the top abortion provider and now we know they are engaged in selling the parts of dead babies? And you don't want to cut off their funding. So if all lives matter --
Well, I think you have to -- I'm not supporting Planned Parenthood. Somebody said I was supporting -- I 'm not supporting --
Would you cut off funding to Planned Parenthood?
I'm against Planned Parenthood -- yes, I would. I don't know where you got this information. I never said that.
That was the report.
I'm against Planned Parenthood -- totally against -- well, because you read a wrong report, Bill. You have bad researchers, what can I tell you.
No, no, no, no, no. It was an erroneous report but that was the report. We will take care of the people who did that.
All right. It's wrong.
It's insane!
It's nothing. And you know, there is one clause that even you don't talk about very much that nobody really understands. If Israel is forced to attack Iran, we have to -- as you probably see by the reading of the agreement, we have to protect Iran from Israel. And nobody's been able to explain this one. But -- and it's something that even you don't talk about, Sean, which is surprising for you. I think you have to add that.
I'll add that.
But you know, if Israel attacks, I think we're supposed -- which, by the way...
We cannot do that. Morally -- morally, that is impossible.
No, of course we're not going to do that, but the way the agreement reads, we're supposed to do that. Can you believe it?
So here he's chanting during these negotiations, "Death to America." The destruction of Israel is non-negotiable. As recently as September 2nd, they're burning our flag, the Israeli flag. My question. Would you even sit down with these people? Shouldn't -- shouldn't it be a prerequisite that they recognize Israel, stop changing "Death to America " before we talk to them?
So Sean, you know, I just was in Washington. I just literally got back, and I'm sitting in front of you, and I haven't even looked in a mirror, so I hope I'm OK. I hope...
Yes.
Think of it! We haven't even asked them. Then we're fighting them in Yemen. We're fighting -- they're backing, as you know, Assad in Syria, and we don't even do -- we're fighting on the other side. And it's, like, what are we doing?
Right.
And they don't want to mention anything outside, and they're getting all of this money. But think of the prisoners. We have four people over there. We don't even mention them. And all you'd have to do, in my opinion, if it's the right messenger, Sean, say, We want our four prisoners back. That should have taken place two years ago, not now.
Yes, and we know -- we know also...
So it's the most incredibly...
Yes. And the Iranian-backed rebels took more hostages in Yemen, the Houthis, this weekend. All right, but we got to take a quick break.
That's true.
400,000 men!
We've got a lot of problems in our country.
So 59...
And my plan does work, and the wall works. And people will see that. And it won't take long to do, believe me...
The poll that came out...
... and people with knowledge know my plan works.
A poll that came out shows 59 percent of Americans agree with your policy on immigration. But I just want to get you on the record. Are you saying absolutely, people from Syria, the Middle East, 400,000 men -- those are men that we don't know what their backgrounds are, where their hearts are -- should we allow any of them into this country, or any aid that we offer should be financial only?
Look, from a humanitarian standpoint, I'd love to help, but we have our own problems. We have so many problems that we have to solve. You have over there the Gulf states, tremendously wealthy. You have five groups of people, six groups. They're not taking anybody. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain -- these are tremendously wealthy and powerful from the standpoint of money. They're not taking anybody.
All right...
Russia's not taking -- nobody's taking. We're supposed to take. We have to straighten out our own problems. You have millions of people potentially. And if Obama would have gone across the line that he drew, the artificial line in the sand that he drew, you wouldn't have this problem in the first place.
Military.
I want to give it to the veterans. I want to give it to lots of different veterans groups. And you know, their rates are going from $4,000 or $5,000 an ad to $200,000 and $250,000 an ad. I hate to say this, because of me, because the numbers were always very low for the debates. Nobody watched the debates. It was a very poorly rated thing. I hate to tell that to you. But you know that. And FOX had 24 million people watching, and now...
It was neat to see...
Whatever it is.
It was nice to see you and Ted Cruz together today. This is the worst deal since Munich 1938. Glad you were out there. Thank you so much for being with us, Mr. Trump.
I think it's the worst contract I've ever seen negotiated. It's the most one-sided deal and it's a disgrace, and we shouldn't have to take it. As people from the United States, we should not have to take this!
Welcome back. Donald Trump is on the phone. Mr. Trump, can you hear us?
I can. Hi, Chris.
But you have none now.
-- before you get to the 24 days, Chris --
But you have none now.
Chris, let me finish talking.
Please, go ahead.
You just went -- I mean, what are you making, a statement or asking me a question?
Well, but Mr. Trump, you make a very interesting point there --
-- they don't do anything. So --
You look at China --
That's why when people ask about, gee, I wonder -- Trump's poll numbers are skyrocketing, that's why. That's not going to happen if I'm running things, Chris. It won't happen and you know what?
But the question is well why -- Why won't it happen?
The world will like us better.
China stays China. Russia stays Russia. India says India. They all want to do business with Iran, they were not in favor of more sanctions. The same with many of your European partners --
That's called leadership.
What do you say?
-- you would have been able to make a real deal. I'm all for a deal, just so you understand. Because I understand the power of nuclear. I had an uncle who was a professor at MIT, he fully understood. He used to tell me things that are incredible, and that was a long time ago. I'm all for a deal. But you got to make a good deal. You can't make a bad deal and we were begging for this deal. We look like a bunch of beggars. We were begging for this deal.
We don't have any proof to the contrary.
Chris, when they asked Kerry about the hostages, he said we didn't want to discuss the hostages because we didn't want to complicate the negotiation. How ridiculous is that? But he made that statement. And Obama, your friend over at CBS, made the same statement. He said we didn't want the complicate the negotiations. Now, what is the big deal? First of all, the first day, the first hour, the first minute, the first question should have been hostages. We want our hostages back.
But would you have scrapped the whole deal over that?
They don't help you, they do help us.
I'm just saying we have every reason to believe from the people who are at the table that they said that.
Chris, you would have gotten the hostages back --
I'm saying --
Kerry said he didn't want to even talk about the hostages --
No. We know --
-- because he didn't want to complicate the negotiations, Chris.
I think -- I understand what you're saying. But I think it's a little different than that. I think that it was a topic of conversation. They didn't want to balance the entire deal on the hostages.
They don't know anything about negotiations. They didn't read "The Art of the Deal, " they never will. The Iranians are great negotiators, the Persians have always been great negotiators. They are laughing in Iran right now at how stupid we are.
Let's move on to a different topic. Ben Carson, he's also making a lot of traction. He's feeling good about himself, enough that he's coming at you. He is a man of faith, everybody knows that, it's a cornerstone of his existence and certainly his motivation to run.
Well, I don't know that. I mean, I had not heard that. I have known Ben Carson, of him, for a long time. I never heard faith was a big thing until just recently when he started running.
He's a Seventh Day Adventist. I mean, it's -- something he talks about a lot.
So I don't know about Ben Carson's faith. And all of a sudden he becomes this great religious figure. I don't think he's a great religious figure. I saw him yesterday quoting something and he was quoting on humility and it looked like he had just memorized it about two minutes before he made the quote. So, you know, don't tell me about Ben Carson. Now --
Well, Ben Carson is coming at you, too. He says --
He's starting to hit me so I hit back. I only hit back when I get hit. I'm a great counter-puncher.
I know -- Let me ask you --
But Ben Carson, you're talking about his faith -- excuse me, Chris -- go back and look at his past. Go back and look at his views on abortion and see where he stands. You talk about abortion, I mean, go back and look at his views on abortion. Now all of a sudden he gets on very low key, I mean, frankly he looks like -- he makes Bush look like the Energizer Bunny. He's very low key. He's got --
Oh. Strong words.
-- a lot of people pushing him. But Ben Carson, you look at his faith and I think you're not going to find so much. And you look at his views on abortion, which were horrendous. And that's, I think, why I'm leading with all of the evangelicals. I'm, as you know in your poll, No. 1, I'm leading Ben Carson by a lot. You know, you said, oh, Ben Carson is surging. Well, I'm almost double his numbers. So you know --
Oh, absolutely. But I'm saying he came out of nowhere is all I'm saying. He's not a big celebrity. You know, people didn't know about him. He doesn't get anywhere near the attention that you get.
Well, I only bring this up, Chris -- Hey, Chris -- I only bring it up because I saw him hitting me yesterday. He's questioning my faith. I happen to be a great believer in God, a great believer in the Bible.
He is definitely question your faith.
Hey, Chris, who is he to question my faith when I am -- he doesn't even know me. I've met him a few times. But I don't know Ben Carson. He was a doctor, perhaps an OK doctor, by the way, you can check that out, too. They're not talking about a -- He was an OK doctor.
I don't know about OK doctor. You know, e was the first man to separate conjoined twins.
And now because he's a doctor and he hired one nurse, he's going to end up being the President of the United States? But for him to criticize me on my faith is absolutely -- for him to read from the Bible in his memory, it looked like he memorized it two minutes before he went on stage.
Do you think you're more a man of faith than he is?
Ben Carson is not going to be your next president, that I can tell you.
You said look at that face. You said look at that face.
I mean, between Carson and Carly --
You said look at that face!
I'll say some nice things about you at least so that they'll say at least he says nice things about some people.
But then you should say that.
-- who's a highly-respected man, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, wrote a paper that was one of the worst papers on CEOs. She goes down as one of the worst ever. The company practically created --
What I'm saying is that --
Excuse me, wait. So -- but Carly, the statement on Carly, I'm talking about her persona. Her persona is not going to be -- she's not going to be president. She's had a terrible, terrible failed time --
How? Where's the persona in that?
And what she's saying about my hair, I know that's OK and you won't defend me.
Somebody comes on my air and makes fun of your hair, I'm going to them to shut up and move on to something else. If somebody does that to you on my air, and they say the he shouldn't be president because of his hair, look at his hair, I'll say, shut up. Let's talk about something else. Because it's unkind and it's unpresidential.
Well, you don't have to defend me. I'm not looking for anyone to defend me. I'm just saying, when she and other people hit me on things, nobody ever comes to my defense. So I'm just saying this --
You come to your defense.
Carly had a terrible time in business. She destroyed a company. You have to get the report from Jeffrey Sonnenfeld of Yale. He's the expert on Carly. It's a disaster, and check out Lucent beforehand. So you have Ben saying what he said, you have Carly saying -- these are two people that will not be president.
All I'm saying is that you are the frontrunner. You say that you're going to be President of the United States. There is a manner of behavior that goes with that. I'm not saying be Mr. P.C., I'm not saying be Captain Gentility and let everybody beat you up, but the idea of returning a blow every time you receive one, you know that doesn't work in any high level situation.
Well I'm a a believer; perhaps you're not. Maybe that's why your show isn't doing as well as it should be, because you really have a better show than them.
Ah, see, that's not nice. That's not nice.
Let me just tell you --
No, I don't say you're not supposed to hit back. I'm saying --
And I think that the evangelicals understand me. First of all, they know I'm going to run the country properly and I'm not going to let everybody rip us off and take our jobs and take our money. And that's very important to the evangelicals. They are very smart people. And they also know I'm a man of faith. I don't want Ben Carson criticizing my faith. Certainly when he doesn't know me, he can't do that.
She chose to go, as you know.
I hated that. But -- and now she's out. But I must tell you that we are a land of laws. I would like to see her get a different job or at least let the clerks do that particular work. We are in a position that's been a terrible situation that has taken place out there. And I understand both sides of the argument. And I embrace both sides of the argument. You know, you can embrace both sides of an argument. But it would be really good if she could either stay and let the clerks do that work that she can't do, or in the alternative, get herself something else, where she doesn't come into conflict. But that's the way of handling it. It's something that is going to work its way out but it is a messy situation. No question about it.
You have increased your percentage in both of those categories, that's true.
I'm leading with Hispanics and I'm leading with the African-Americans. Well, if that's the case, and if I'm going to get 25 percent African-American, we're going to have a tremendous victory for the Republicans. Because no Republican that's ever gotten more than 9 percent or 10 percent. And I said I'm going to do great with the African-Americans because I'm going to create jobs and Obama is not creating jobs for them.
Well, as we --
I'm going to create jobs and I'm going to create wealth for them. So I've been saying this for a long time. So when that poll came out two days ago that I'm leading with African-Americans and leading with Hispanics, I was the only one that wasn't surprised.
That I'm sure is true. Mr. Trump, as always, we appreciate you coming on to explain the situation and your positions. We look forward to you putting more meat on the bones as we go forward in this campaign. Congratulations on the recent poll results. Thank you for coming on NEW DAY.
Thank you very much, Chris.
REM's "It's The End Of The World As We Know It, " which is a great song and Donald Trump played a, played it at a rally yesterday in DC. And he just became the first Republican candidate to top 30 percent support in the polls and he's joining us on the phone right now. Are you there, Big D?
I am. Hi, Whoopi. How are you doing?
I heard him. He said, "Hi, Whoopi. How are you doing?"
I said, I said, how are you doing?
I've very well. Now you're in. Hey, now you're in. We can hear you. So let's, we know that you don't have a lot of time. So I'm, I'm gonna kick this off. You know, you were down in Washington. You're very upset about the deal made in Iran. And so I'm gonna ask you about this. What, if, if you're gonna scrap that deal, what's your plan?
Well, the plan would have been, and I love the concept of a deal because nuclear is nothing but trouble. There's never been anything like it.
That's for sure.
It's the worst and something should be done.
Right.
Now, we have other places. You look at North Korea and other places, Pakistan...
But, but, Donald, we only got you for a couple of minutes.
I know.
So I'm just asking, what's your plan?
But my, my plan would have been to increase the sanctions substantially and make a much, much better deal. We do not have a good deal. It's a great deal for Iran, but it's not a good deal for us. It's a terrible deal. In addition to all the money we're giving, $150 billion, in addition to so many different things, so many elements of the deal, it's going to lead to nuclear proliferation and it's a very bad deal for us and it's a very bad deal for Israel.
This is, this is Paula Faris talking right now. I know you also said one of your priorities would be to get those prisoners out. But I wanna go to the recent polling. You were up eight points since August, but your biggest gains have been upon Republican women. You're up 13 points. So my question to you...
Wow. That's good. I didn't even know that. That's very good.
You didn't know that. A lot of people are gonna...
That makes me happy.
But that doesn't include Megyn Kelly, Donald.
Well, that, probably, that's true. You know, the, the interesting thing, my daughter, Ivanka, and wife, they say, you know, you should speak more about women's health issues, because they know how strongly and committed I am to it. And Jeb Bush and, and to a large extent, Hillary, are not committed like I'm committed. And they say you really, Ivanka came up to me...
That's, but you...
... just today, she said...
No. Hillary's very committed to health issues. She has her whole career, Donald. Come on.
Well, she said, speak about women's, OK, speak about women's health issues, 'cause I've been very, very committed to it and to me it's very important. And I did notice that in all of the polls, and most of the recent polls, I'm doing really well with women and, which is good. Of course, I'm doing really well overall. But the other one that just came out, and it came out yesterday in a poll, with African-Americans I have 25 percent, which is the highest...
Whoopi.
... which is the highest number that they've ever had for a Republican candidate in a primary, which I'm really honored by.
Why do I feel like, but, Donald, I have a question. Why do you always slip up with your words when it comes to women? I feel like there's been a lot of stuff in the, I mean, in the news where you slip up with your words when you're talking about women, but then you say there's so many women on your jock. I'm confused.
Right. I understand. And don't forget, to a large extent, much of what you've seen is as an entertainer. Because, you know, I had The Apprentice, which was a tremendously successful show.
It was a great show. I've got to say.
And there's one thing having to do...
So, but, you know, just to follow up on that, let, let, now, don't hang up when I do this. When, 'cause you talked about Carla Fiorina in "Rolling Stone " magazine.
Right.
And you said look at that face, would anyone vote for that, can you imagine that the face of our next president. Are you making fun of her looks, Donald? 'Cause I know you don't like it...
Not at all. No. I'm talking about the persona, Joy. This is Joy?
Yeah, it's me.
Good. Good to have you back, Joy.
Yes. Thank you, Donald.
I can't see you. It's so good to have you back where you belong. This is where you belong. That's great. But, and, and I'll get over there soon and we'll have to do the show that way.
Yeah, come live so we can look at, yeah.
But, I, I will say, I will say this. Look, I'm talking about her persona. She failed miserably at Hewlett Packard, she failed at, at Lucent. She was, before that she was at Lucent. She then ran for the Senate. She lost in a landslide.
All right.
Now she's running for president. I'm talking about her persona. She's got the wrong, we need somebody...
Well, then why don't you talk about her brain instead of her face?
We need somebody that's, I, I've made a tremendous fortune.
Donald, I have a question for you.
Yes?
Kanye West just talked about running for president. Would you ever go on a Trump/Kanye ticket? Is that something you would ever consider doing? 'Cause I think people would be interested.
Well, it's certainly interesting. You know the thing, the thing I like most about Kanye West? He always speaks so nicely about me. He says the nicest things. So I'll never hit anybody that frankly speaks nicely about me. I can't do that.
I have, I have, Mr. Trump, I have to ask you because right now, the majority of the support with Republicans is going to you and it's also going to Ben Carson. You guys represent 51 percent as of the newest polls. It seems like the gloves have come off. They asked to, they asked him to differentiate himself between the, the two of you. And he says in comparison, I don't deny my faith in God. Have the gloves come off between you and Ben Carson?
Well, I think so. I think he started it. So remember I like to finish it. It's happened five times now. And every one of those people went down. He talked about my faith. He doesn't know me. I hardly know this guy other than he goes to my club in Palm Beach. I mean, I literally, hardly know him.
Well, just, Donald, just, just, just so you...
... he, he should not be questioning somebody else's faith when he knows nothing about that person. Because I really don't know Ben Carson and he certainly doesn't know me. And I'm killing him...
OK. Well, to, to take this...
And by the way, I'm killing him in all the polls.
... to take this to another, to take this, just exactly what you're saying, to a sort of different level because, you know, your stance on immigration is, is a little testy for folks, I think. And you're married to a woman who is an immigrant.
True.
You know lots of folks. Your parents, I believe, aren't Native American so they were probably immigrants as well.
That's true.
And, and Ivana. And, and so what is the, what is, what is it you're actually trying to say? Are you, are you saying that all illegal immigrants, not just Mexican?
Yes. Illegals.
But wait, wait, wait. Not just Mexicans, all illegal immigrants?
Oh, of course not. No, no. Not Mexicans. From all over the world, including people coming in, we have people coming from parts of the world that nobody even believes. I'm saying illegal immigration is a tremendous problem in this country and I want them out. I also feel we have to have a border. We have to create a border. We're a land of laws and we have to create a border. Right now thousands of people a week are pouring through our borders. They're pouring through.
Are you talking, are you...
No. I'm talking about right now...
What about if they look like models? Donald, what about the illegal model immigrants? Are they allowed in?
... I am talking about our southern, I'm talking about our southern border. We have thousands of people pouring through. We can't do that. And by the way, with that comes tremendous crime. And as you remember, when I first announced, a lot of people hit me on that. Now they're all admitting that I was right. Illegal immigration is a huge problem.
I'm sorry, Donald. I, I just wanna, I just wanna be clear.
Yes.
Because not all Mexican immigrants are murderers and rapists. I just want to straighten that up. And, and I think, and I think...
100 percent. 100 percent. And, and, Whoopi, I have great relationships with people from Mexico, with Hispanics. And by the way, I came in number one in the Hispanic poll last week.
That, I'm, I'm, you know, I'm in a lot of polls myself. But my question, but I just want to make sure, I just want to make sure that when you're talking about illegal immigration, you are including all of the folks who are here illegally. And the best way, in your mind, to get people to not be illegal anymore is to throw everybody out? How will you find everybody?
Well, the people have to go, what I'm saying is people have to go through a process. And we can even expedite the process. But we have to go through a process to become legal and be in this country. I want to have people come into the country, but they have to come in legally. And if they don't come in legally, that's not good.
Donald. I'm so used to calling you The Donald that I got... Tell me.
Well, look, I do have a very big heart and I want to take care of people. And that's a very important part of leading, especially when you're talking about leading the country. I used to be a Democrat and Ronald Reagan used to be a Democrat and he switched and I switched years ago. And now I'm a Republican, I'm a conservative Republican, but with a very big heart. We have to take care of people. Whether it's on women's health issues or so many other issues, we have to take care of people. And I think that last issue is one of the reasons that everybody says, and I mean, you informed me today, but I'm leading everywhere. I'm leading with women. I'm leading with evangelicals.
Donald, what do you wanna say to women? What's your message?
I wanna say that I cherish women and I will protect women and I will take care of women and I have great respect for women.
So you're not against defunding Planned Parenthood, am I hearing that?
I, I am against abortion. And they are...
Three percent, wait a second.
That's a tremendous, that is, Joy, that is a tremendous amount of the work they do.
No, it's not. You've got, Donald, the thing that, that we want you to do, as we, as we go into the rest of this run...
Right.
I think, since you've shown to have such a big heart for the Syrians, you might want to extend that to women in this country.
Well, you know, Joy, I'll tell you what. You know, you said three percent. But as you know, the numbers are 55 and 60 and 65 percent of the money. And what we're saying...
No. Donald, you know what, when you come here, we will, it'll be so much easier...
OK. We will...
... 'cause we have to go.
We will talk about it.
Come sit right here.
I will be there.
We'll have some snacks and stuff. Maybe a little wine.
OK. You have a deal.
We'll have some tacos.
I look forward to it. Thank you very much.
Donald, thank you. I'm glad you go on GretaWire. I'm flattered. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
OK. Mr. Trump, unfortunately, we're out of time. Thanks so much for being with us.
Thank you very much.
All right. So you are going to go in, you're going to wing it. People should know you are not allowed to bring in any notes. You are not allowed to bring any weapons in. You can't have you know, a samurai sword. You can have a piece of paper and a pen just like I do here. You're not going to wear the hat tomorrow night at the debate. Are you? Are you going to wear the hat?
No, I'm only wearing it today because it's so windy out here on the Pacific. The wind is pretty strong so I didn't want my hair blowing around. I just have too much respect for your program.
Right. And beside if you have the hat they can't make fun of the hair. So you don't want to do that.
That's true. That's true.
Yes, yes. My question is this. Does that bother you that they were out there? Does that bother you?
No. Because inside I had 20,000 people and it was a love fest. It was incredible. As you know the American Airlines Center where the Mavericks play it was packed and it was an amazing event. Again, we had everybody. We had the Tea Party. We had the Evangelicals. We had Hispanics. We had rich, we had poor. We had everybody. It was an absolute incredible evening.
They'll never let me but if they did, these are the questions that I would ask you tomorrow night. Ready?
All right.
On me -- ok. On me.
So what they've said is a lie.
Ok. But if you say that tomorrow night that you're going to announce in three weeks, they're going to say you're dodging and all of that. And all the other guys are going to go --
No, I'm not dodging.
That's what they're going to say.
Very importantly taxes are going down and corporate taxes are going to go down and we are going to put people to work again. And I' going to bring jobs back from China and Mexico and Japan and all of the other places that are stealing our jobs. And we're going to have an economy that's going to be booming again because right now it's a disaster.
Ok. Ok. We know that. We know that but I have got to challenge you on the women thing. I've got to challenge you on the women thing.
All right. Go ahead.
It is.
The answer is I would vote to defund, yes.
But he says he is going to do that.
Well, he is not going to do that you have to have that and, you know, like it's one of those things. He won't have that ability, in my opinion.
All right. But you are not going to call him a pinhead or anything like that.
We need somebody with great ability for doing that.
You are not going to question his faith. You're not going to do any of that.
No, I wouldn't do that at all. It depends on what he does with me.
Oh, no, no. You should take a pledge that you are not going to do it no matter what he does. All right -- last question.
Look, I don't know who is coming from where. I hear everybody is going to be hitting me because I'm number one in the polls.
I would if I were there. I would hit you with a pie.
And I'll respond accordingly Bill.
All right.
Thank you very much.
After speaking to your family, what did your family say about how you were tonight?
Well, they were very proud and very happy and it was a beautiful time. I had an amazing time. Three hours is probably a record-setting long debate. But I guess you are selling a lot of commercials doing that. They increased. I guess it was supposed to be two, but they were very professional the way they handled it. CNN did a very good job.
We agree about that. It seemed like it was well run. There was a lot of talk about. Who do you think came out on top with the best ideas for the American people?
Well, I think everybody did well. Nobody did poorly. And really everyone did very well. I was very impressed.
Anybody more than anybody else.
Well, I don't want to say that. I think certain people did really well. I would never say that, of course.
Carly Fiorina is getting a lot of buzz, that she stepped up tonight.
Really well, I thought. I think she's a very nice person. I think really I think everybody did very well.
Do you feel that you did something differently tonight than you did in the first debate?
No, I think probably the first debate went very well for me also. They are saying very nice things. I just heard a couple of people come over and say, wow, that was great. So I think, you know, I'm very happy with both performances actually.
There seemed to have been more discussion amongst the candidates during the breaks and afterwards here in this debate than it was the first one. What types --
I think that's true. Well, we're getting to know each other a little bit. Even though it is quite tough and sometimes a little nasty, we're getting to know each other. And you know you develop relationships. I have a lot of respect for a lot of the people on the stage.
What have you learned after tonight.
Well, I've learned that I have no trouble standing for three hours. And, you know, I mean, literally it must be a record. I hope that the audience is OK, because I actually think it is a little bit too long. But I learned that we have a lot of talent in the Republican Party. And I think we're going to do very well come Election Day.
Can you point to anything that you heard tonight where you listened and thought, you know what, I like that idea, I think I'm going to use that?
Well, I heard a lot of things. And we'll discuss it on your show at length, because I have a whole family over here.
What does it mean, you have you family in the crowd, your daughter, your son --
Well, that's right. Here they are. I mean, it's great. To have them and they seemed to be so receptive today. They like -- I could see they were giving me the high five and high sign.
Ivanka must have liked it when you said you should be on the ten dollar bill. That was high praise.
That's like. I like it. I mean, she sat for a long time tonight. But we had a great time. Everybody had a good time. And I was very impressed with everybody.
So, if tomorrow, after the pundits discussed and the polls come out and they say Trump was on top, would you be surprised?
No, I wouldn't be. I think I did very well. I think -- everybody did well, but I think I did very well.
Gave enough meat on the bones?
I think so, yes.
Mr. Trump, thank you for talking to us. Good luck going forward.
Thank you.
Right.
And 60 percent is big when you have 15 or 16 people up there.
I would just like in one debate for moderators to treat you like the other candidates.
Yes.
Because if you're back on your heels for three hours straight, I'm going to get a different performance from you -- and I'm talking as a Republican now who's trying to figure out who I'm going to vote for -- then if you're treated like the other candidates. I know they love ratings --
Well, they tried.
I think that makes you Rhett Butler, Donald.
Well maybe. That would be not so bad.
So Donald, obviously most of the debate was about you. But as you stood up there, who else stood out to you? Were you impressed by any of the other candidates?
I was. I thought there was nobody that did poorly. I think that -- I think that Carly did well but I didn't see her. You know, Joe was sort of saying and all of --
Was Jeb Bush, did Jeb Bush have more energy last night?
He did. I thought he was -- a ctually he's a very nice guy. I thought he did fine. I thought he did very well.
So Donald, let me ask you about the casino question.
I thought he was going to push me harder to apologize to his wife.
Let me ask you about the Florida casino question. Did you ever ask Jeb Bush personally to bring casinos to the State of Florida? There seems to be some debate between you two about that.
No, Joe. What happened is a group I knew wanted him to do it. I wasn't involved in it. They wanted him to do it. Ultimately, I think he did it. I didn't even follow the whole process, but I think he did it in some form. But I wasn't involved with it. And ultimately the Indians got gaming approved. But I was not involved with it at all. And as I told him, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. I was not into it at that time. That was a different time of my life. But it was -- it sort of coincided but it was not from me.
Donald --
He knows that. I mean, he knows that. There was a little article some place, so maybe -- and he picked that up. And I was surprised to hear him say that actually because it wasn't true.
Donald, Ben Carson, what did he say last night in the debate that proved he should be closing in on you in the polls?
Well, we just -- are you talking about debate -- what did he say personally to me? Or what did he say --
Donald, it's Richard Haass. The pope is going to be coming to this country in a couple of days, and one of the issues he's really made central to his own period in office is climate change. Last night, there was some conversation about it. People talked about George Chilton, a carbon tax. Other people have other ideas. Where do you come out? How seriously do you take it? What do you think the United States ought be doing about it?
Yes, I consider climate change to be not one of our big problems. I consider it to be not a big problem at all. I think it's weather; I think it's weather changes. There could be some manmade something. But, you know, if you look at China, they're doing nothing about it. Other countries are doing nothing about it. It's a big planet. I do not view -- I view climate change as being -- the big problem we have is nuclear climate change. That's what our climate change is and that's our problem. And I'm a little surprised -- Putin is doing it; I don't believe Putin is a believer at all. Putin is doing it for his own economic advantage if he is actually in favor of climate change.
It was a Trump debate.
And it kept going pretty right until the end and, you know, it was a little bit strange and there was the statement, any statement made by me, they'd ask the people, well, Trump said this and Trump said that. So it was a little bit of a difficult situation to be in. But with that being said, and then I'm just looking at the final numbers from Drudge and I'm up to 61 percent, and "Time " magazine was 70 percent -- and don't forget -- did you say 65 percent, Mika?
Exactly.
A lot of people didn't get any time.
Totally agree.
I guess I have to be complimented, because supposed they go the other way where they didn't ask me any questions, then I'd be calling you saying I was treated very unfairly because they didn't ask me enough questions.
All right, Donald Trump, thank you so much for calling in. We greatly appreciate it.
Thank you very much, folks.
Did anyone even ask? I know that's a Clinton news network, is it that they don't like veterans?
You know what, there was not one question relating to that and not too much on the military by the way, but nothing relating to the veterans. Those days believe me are over. Ok, yes ma 'am, go ahead.
Can you hire me please?
Go ahead, go ahead, and then we will go right around here -- a lot of people with hands up. Ok, let's go.
Mr. Trump, I was wondering if we could get together and work on the unsafe conditions at the Seaborg Plant. It's been months since I gave you that information.
I remember that.
You and I should have a press conference because both governors in Massachusetts and New Hampshire aren't protecting the first responders, and I would like to work with you on it.
We will take a look at. We are going to take a look at it. Go ahead. Next, back here, go ahead.
In the United States we don't have such a good record when it comes to paying off debt.
Not such a good one, we owe 19 trillion. I would say we are not doing too well.
Welcome back to New Hampshire.
Thank you. Do you think it's hot enough in this place? Last night was pretty hot but this blows it away. Go ahead.
I applaud the gentleman who brought up the Muslims training camps here in the USA, the FBI knows all about that. But America has also guns pointed at ordinary citizens here.
Don't get nervous. You are on about seven television networks. Don't get nervous. Don't choke.
The Bureau of Land Management and Agriculture. They are going into different branches and shutting them down, regulation but they seem to be pointing a gun to make sure they get their fees. This is our own government putting us at siege. How can we get in and stop those?
So many things are going to change. These are regulations. That's one. You know one of the things -- being in real estate we have army bases and navy bases. So many are for sale, and so many have been sold over the period of time, and you say how many can we sell? I see it all the time. They come across many desk -- so many. Things are going to change. Ok, go ahead. You had a question over there, go ahead, you young and handsome guy. Go ahead.
This gentleman Daniel Treves -- this was a great man.
Daniel Treves was a great man. He was my friend. He passed away. He was my friend.
Mr. Trump, can you please explain your position on the second amendment?
On the what?
An IED blast and a couple of ground incidents.
Well, you look great, go ahead
Hello, Mr. Trump.
Ok, go ahead. Give me a question.
Do you plan to visit with the Pope when he comes to Philadelphia?
Well, the Pope believes in global warming. You do know that, right? In this room it's so hot in here, maybe I'll start to believe it myself. The room is hot. This room was not designed -- the air conditioning was not designed for this many people. I like the Pope, a lot of personality. Good man. Good man. Yes, ma 'am, good ahead.
My name is Helena Sorenson, and I have a house here in Hampton. I worked very hard all my life. My parents came over during the Berlin airlift in March of 1950. When they landed, they both had to work in the mills. My father became a carpenter, put us through schools, and here we are working hard, getting social security, but my problem is that the people that are coming over here, they're landing on the shore, they have no problem going in, they get food stamps, they get housing, they get electric, they get all of this, and it's coming from our social security money.
I know.
We're getting nothing, nothing.
She's getting more and more excited. Look at that.
Our stock -- I invested in my stock. I worked for the company for 37 years.
And that was Lucent.
Yes, Lucent.
Headed up by whom?
Well, Carly.
That's right that was before Hewlett Packard.
Before Hewlett Packard. I was buying stock to put into my retirement, $87 a share. When I was forced to retire almost 15, 16 years ago, my stock wasn't worth 25 cents. I lost almost a half million dollars. That's what I planned on retiring, and I got nothing.
You know the Carly thing is amazing because a lot of people don't get it. Because Lucent was a disaster you know.
Hi, Mr. Trump. I have not a question but I just want you to know about the nightmares I have, ISIS beheadings, Rochester's -- I'm having horrible visions of people I know and everyone being loaded up into box cars, you know like another holocaust. I just want you to know about that.
Does anybody have a towel? You know, I lost a lot of weight. The good thing is running for President, believe it or not, every room we have is packed and nobody has enough air conditioning. Because of that, and I'm losing a lot of weight so it's not so bad. Go ahead.
My question is this. If you're elected President, one of the things that have been happening over the last several decades is our Congressmen and our Senators voting themselves huge pay raises, and other benefits. If they are elected for one term, they get a lifetime pension, they get medical, and they don't have to join Obamacare. If you're elected, sir...
In fact, they don't have to use Obamacare, isn't that incredible.
Hello.
Don't get nervous.
Everybody has awesome questions, very big picture, and I love that. My question is a little closer to home.
Ok.
I just spent the last two and a half years and $50,000 working to keep my daughter safe. So my question to you is, the result could have been better -- under your leadership and authority do you think it's going to trickle down all the way to the state level and our court systems to help families like mine not have to endure what I went through.
Did you say to keep them safe? What are you doing?
Well, it's over now, but -- it's over now. Family court system is broken.
I see. Very much so here, I hear it. The whole court system is broken by the way.
Mr. Trump.
Go ahead. You go first.
Just last week, one of the other candidates said that he -- the base realignment and closure system was good because it kept workers on their toes. Do you believe that the way to make people more efficient is to threaten to take away their jobs, our military, and those who support our military?
You're saying that's what's happening, right? I heard that yesterday actually. Not a good situation. One more question. One more -- make it a good one. Make it a good one. Go ahead, ma 'am, right here, right here. Give her the mic. Make it a good one. Otherwise we'll have to do one more.
Joining us now with reaction, 2016 GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, good to see you, sir.
Hi, Sean.
According to what you said on one of the talk shows, you got Hillary Clinton to go to your wedding.
That's true.
Because you gave her money.
That's true.
Maybe it works for Hillary Clinton...
I was -- excuse me, Jeb.
... it doesn't work for anybody on this stage.
Jeb, I was a businessman. I got along with Clinton. I got along with everybody. That was my job, to get along with people.
But the simple fact is...
I didn't want to -- excuse me, one second.
No. The simple fact is...
I didn't want to -- Jeb...
... Donald...
OK...
If you're elected president, would you take a salary?
No, I won't. I won't do that. Actually, you and I discussed that once before. I will take no salary whatsoever.
All right, Mr. Trump, thanks so much for being with us. We appreciate your time.
Thank you very much.
You're proud of your family, just as I am.
Correct.
Yes, you did.
Totally false.
You wanted it, and you didn't get it because I was opposed to casino gambling before...
I promise, I would have gotten it.
... during and after! And that's not -- I'm not going to be bought by anybody!
I promise...
You're proud of your family, just as I am.
Correct.
We have a problem in this country. It's called Muslims. We know our current president is one. You know he's not even an American.
We need this question, this first question.
The one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something, that was generous and gave me money -- was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.
I didn't.
Yes, you did. When he asked Florida to have casino gambling, we said no.
Wrong.
No, no, I know, but you're saying -- I'm asking more about -- you had said that you were surprised he didn't push harder. I'm wondering...
Well, I said he might have pushed harder. I didn't know if he was going to push harder, but I wouldn't have -- it wouldn't have changed my mind.
Republican front-runner Donald Trump, thank you so much, as always, for calling in. We appreciate your taking our questions.
Thank you very much, Jake.
But I take that point. But you've raised these questions so often in the past, why can't you just say definitively yes or no --
Well, I haven't raised the question.
-- Obama was born in the United States. You've raised it many times. And he's not a Muslim.
George, you have raised the question. I haven't raised the question. I don't talk about it and I don't like talking about somebody else's faith. He talks about his faith and he can do that. But I don't talk about other people's faith. It's not appropriate for me to talk about somebody else's faith.
Let's talk...
And I don't mean a problem here. I mean this is a worldwide problem.
Let's get to that worldwide problem, because we now also learned over this week that Russia has now moved combat aircraft and surface-to-air missiles into Syria.
Right.
But just because...
And I...
I'm trying to figure out...
And Assad is -- hey, George, we're the best thing that ever happened to Assad.
I'm just trying to figure out what you would do. I mean, are you saying that President Putin would actually do something against his national interests, if he perceives it that way, pull out of Syria, just because he gets along with you?
I'm not saying get along. George, the word isn't get along. The word -- the word is respect. He has no respect for our country and our leadership at this -- at this moment. And, frankly, he's doing things that are very aggressive. And the reason he's doing them is because he doesn't have respect.
You're still ahead. You're at 20...
Is that correct?
I understand.
He was the governor.
Donald Trump, thanks very much for joining us.
Thank you very much.
Mr. Trump, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS.
Good morning Chuck. I am liking you more and more all the time, those are great numbers.
You like the poll numbers, I'm guessing? Let me start --
I certainly do.
Let me start with what you did in Iowa last night. You brought your bible to the event.
Right.
But the other part of his question was -- it sounded like he wanted to get rid of all Muslims from America. That's the part that had some people believe was the most offensive part of his question. Why not push back on that?
Well, I feel strongly. The Muslims are excellent -- I don't know. So many Muslims that are such fabulous people. There's a problem. I mean there's no question about it. We can be politically correct and we can say there's no problem whatsoever but the fact is there was a problem with some and it's a very severe problem and it's a problem that's taking place all over the world. But I have such respect and love for so many other people. They're great people.
Can you imagine supporting or being comfortable if a Muslim ever became president of the United States?
I can say that, you know, it's something that at some point could happen. We will see. I mean, you know, it's something that could happen. Would I be comfortable? I don't know if we have to address it right now, but I think it is certainly something that could happen.
You said you had no problem putting a Muslim in our cabinet.
I mean some people have said it already happened frankly but, of course, you wouldn't agree with that and --
Actually, let's get to that. Why won't you concede that the president is a Christian and that the president was born in the United States?
Because I don't talk about people's faith. Now, in all fairness, he said he was a Christian and he said he is a Christian. He attended the church of Reverend Wright. And so, you know, I am willing going to take him at his word for that. I have no problem with that.
Let me ask you about the Pope's visit. He is been pretty tough on capitalism and pretty tough on people that he believes overly worship money. You're somebody that likes to brag about how wealthy you are. What do you make of what the Pope would think of sort of the way you speak about that?
Well, I think if he knew me, I think he would like me. If he doesn't know me perhaps he wouldn't. But if he knew me I think he'd probably like me. He is a little of a different kind of a pope. There's no question about it. He has taken on some pretty big political subjects like climate change and it's very interesting. But he's got a certain way about him that's very unique and very nice.
All right. Ok. Donald Trump I am going to leave it here. I know we're trying to put together another face to face soon. I look forward to that. Thanks for coming on the show.
I do too. Thank you very much -- Jake.
I am so pleased to begin today's show by welcoming back Donald Trump, who remains atop the polls as the favorite to become the nominee of the Republican Party. Donald Trump, welcome back to the Hugh Hewitt Show.
Hi, Hugh, nice to talk to you.
A fair debate, yes?
I thought it was really good. I didn't like the three hours. You didn't, either. I mean, it was just too long. It was too long. Let's be honest.
It was very long.
You know, they did that commercially. This has nothing to do with you or me, although you probably got paid so much money, they needed the commercial income. But you know, it sold out. The first two hours sold out so quickly, thank you, Donald, and they made so much money, you know, they were going to ask, I guess, $4,000 for a short ad, I think a 30 second ad. I'm hearing they got $200 and $250 thousand. So when they sold out the first two hours, they said we don't care about anybody else. Let's go out and make some more money. And maybe Hugh will go along.
I want you to...
But the fair analysis was it was a little long, I think.
I want you to know, Donald Trump, I didn't make a dime. I didn't make a single nickel off of that. So you and I are in the same boat.
Oh, I'm surprised at you. That's all right. That's fine. You did a very good job.
No, that's, I'm just there for the joy.
You did a good job.
I'm just there for, thank you.
I wish they gave you a little more airtime, to be honest with you, right?
I was happy. Jake ran a very complicated, he's the quarterback.
Yeah, that's true.
He's Cardell Jones. I'm the wide receiver.
Right. He did a good job. He's a good man.
What did Ivanka say to you during the break, because she came up to you during the first break, and I thought she'd talk to you. And was she giving you a little pep talk or?
Well, she really thought I was doing very well. You know, I was being hit by a lot of questions, Hugh, and you know, every question, and if I wasn't, the question of the people, of the other candidates, was you know, Mr. Trump said this, Mr. Trump said that. So in fact, somebody estimated it was 47% of the questions that was either to me or the other people with my name in them. And Ivanka thought I was just doing well. She, well, she wouldn't, if I was doing badly, I don't think she'd want to come up and say that. But she thought I was doing very well. And I got a lot of good reviews on it. You know, NBC said I came out second in their poll that they came out with yesterday in terms of who won the debate. But most of them, as you know, Drudge and Time Magazine and all, they had me down as coming down number first. But you know, I was, it was a little bit different, because so many of the questions were related to me. I don't know whether they should be. I don't think they should have been, other than I'm running number one. But I don't think that's the reason for it. I think the reason for it, you know, maybe it's ratings. Who knows what it is?
Well, you are the frontrunner. And so when I asked you, for example, when you're going to have your national security team ready to roll out, and do you have a rollout date, it's because people want to know who's going to help you. Have you figured out that, yet, when you're going to...
I have, and we're going to be announcing something very soon. We have a great team of people. You know, it's interesting, because maybe of the frontrunner status, so many great national security people, including generals, have come to us and called us, and at the top level, and they want to be involved. And I think they like what I say about other things, also. But they want to be involved, and we have a great team in place, or shortly will be in place. But they've actually come to me and said we'd like to be involved. So you know, I'm a little, I'm a little bit maybe not that surprised, but we're going to have a great team in place, absolutely.
Now I'm kind of a hardliner on this stuff, and Frank Gaffney, General Jerry Boykin, Andrew McCarthy, they're all my buddies. They come on the show. Do you think when you roll out this team, I don't know if you'll have McChrystal and Mattis on there, all these great warriors. Do you think people like me who are national security minded will be reassured about your quality of your people?
I do. I think you're going to be impressed, and I think some of the people that we have, I won't even mention whether or not some of the names that you mentioned are involved. But I will tell you I think you will be very impressed by the team. Again, you know, the most important is the person atop, because you have to know what suggestions to take, etc., etc. But I think you'll be very impressed with the team, really top of the line.
Interesting conversation. Again, I think Tapper did a wonderful job, and he was talking to you about Putin, and Dana did a wonderful job as well. Now Putin eats oligarchs for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
Right.
What makes you different from a Russian oligarch, that you'll be able to take him on?
Well, I just think we're going to, look, first of all, the oligarchs are under his control, to a large extent. I mean, he can destroy them, and he has destroyed some of them. And you know, with me, it doesn't make any difference. I was in Moscow not so long ago for an event that we had, a big event, and many of his people were there. It was the Miss Universe contest, which I actually sold, which worked out incredibly well for me. I sold it last week, the Miss Universe pageant. And two weeks ago, it was a tremendous, we made a tremendous deal on it. And two weeks ago, I was in Moscow, I mean, two years ago, I was in Moscow. And a lot of the people, Hugh, they were there, and they had an amazing time. And they're terrific people. You know, I was getting along with them so great. I really loved my weekend, I called it my weekend in Moscow. But I was with the top level people, both oligarchs and generals, and top of the government people. I can't go further than that, but I will tell you that I met the top people, and the relationship was extraordinary. And we just don't have relationships in this country. You know, relationship is very important, whether it's congressmen or whether it's senators, or you know, whatever it may be. Relationship is a very important element, and we don't have it in this country anymore. You know, you can talk about Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan, and you can talk about it, there was two people that were very different in terms of their views, but they got along, and they got things done. We don't have that anymore, Hugh, which is a problem.
I agree. I agree. Now I want to do sort of a Trump case study, because people don't know how you get done what you do, and I want to use the old Post Office as my case study. It's like a Harvard Business School thing.
OK.
I told you offline last week that I was, after we had our little disagreement, and then we talked offline, I told you I'd been by the old Post Office, which used to be my office building. I don't know how anyone can turn that into a hotel. It was the worst office building I ever worked in.
Right.
It's empty, it's old. So how did you get control of it? What are you going to do with it? And what's it tell us about the Trump way that you got it?
All right, great question, actually, because it does have to do very, it's very political. You know, it's the, you would say it's about the best location there is in Washington, right between Congress and the White House.
Amen, yup.
And I've wanted it for a long time. Many people have wanted it. It was one of the most hotly-contested jobs ever in the history of the GSA, government services, as you know. And they had many, many, many bidders. The wealthiest people were bidding, the biggest hotel companies were bidding, big office building companies were bidding. And it's an incredible building, other than the fact that it hasn't been fixed in about 50 or 60 years, so I can imagine if you had an office there, it might not have been so good. But we gutted it out, and it's going to be incredible. It's going to open as a Trump International Hotel, Washington, D.C., it's called, and it will be great. But I will say, the getting of it was a long process. And one of the things I talk about is how did Trump get it in the Obama administration?
Yeah.
Because everybody wanted it, and as you know, Pritzker wanted it, and Pritzker has been, I think probably we could say they're number one, his number one backer, and the Hyatt Hotel Corporation is Pritzker, and they wanted it very badly. And Penny Pritzker is now Secretary of Commerce, and that's a whole story, because she was not a happy camper when Hyatt didn't get it. And many other friends of Obama wanted it, and I got it. And I think the reason I got it, I could tell you lots of reasons I got it, but number one, we have an amazing plan. We're now under budget and ahead of schedule, and substantially ahead of schedule. It was going to open in '17. Now, it's going to open up before the election, and maybe substantially before the election. So we're way ahead of schedule, and that's the way the United States should be. When it's finished, Hugh, it'll be one of the great hotels of the world. You know, the building is magnificent. I think you would say that, right?
Oh, I was on the 5th floor, but it was falling apart back in the 80s when I worked there.
Yeah, well, it's all demolished now. I mean, basically, it's gutted out on the interior, and it's being rebuilt. It'll be brand new inside, I mean, other than certain obvious landmark features, which we're saving.
So I raised this because...
But it's going to be an amazing building. It'll be one of the great hotels, I think, of the world. It'll be certainly maybe the best or one of the best in this country, but it'll be one of the great hotels of the world, and we'll be very proud of it.
Now how does pushing through...
And we're saving the building, which is important.
Yeah.
And the GSA people were very professional, but we're saving the building, and we're doing something good with it.
How does saving a building and pushing through a design and getting the permits and getting the bid play into being the president?
Well, it's a very similar process in terms of many versions -- very political, everything's involved, if you think about. It's financing, which we didn't need, frankly, but it's financing, it's dealing with unions, dealing with non-unions. It's dealing with construction, infrastructure of the United States -- the bridges, the roads, everything falling apart. So it's really a mini-version of fixing up the United States and the infrastructure of the United States. And you know, the beauty is I'm doing it for the right price, and we're way ahead of schedule, so that's what should happen here. I see some of the things that they give out, Hugh, roads that cost so much per square foot to build, and I say I could do it for one-third that price and do a better job. You know, the numbers that they talk about when they talk about reconstruction are absolutely insane. So we have a country that needs rebuilding. We have infrastructure -- the airports and the roads and the schools, so much, so much. And that's, I mean, nobody can compete with me when it comes to that subject.
All right, let's go back to foreign affairs. A lot of presidential candidates do the three I's -- Italy, Ireland, Israel. You've got your own plane. Why not put John Dickerson, Chuck Todd, Jake Tapper, the three big anchors, Chris Wallace, number four for the Sunday shows, put them on the Trump Express and go visit the three I's, and do what every presidential candidate has done before to burnish their foreign policy chops?
Well, I think something like that could happen, to be honest. We certainly have the right aircraft to do it, but I think something like that could happen. And you know, my relationships have been very good with most of the people you just named. And they're starting to treat me more and more fairly. Zogby, I don't know if you just saw, but Zogby just came out with a poll that has me very high, has me actually gone up quite a bit since the debate. Have you seen that poll, Hugh?
Yeah, I did, and I also saw that you won the Morning Call report. You're ahead in all four polls, in fact, this morning, what I saw.
Yeah, we're leading in all of them, but the Zogby was pretty substantially up since the debate, and they did it from, and he's a highly-respected, you know, it's a very highly-respected poll. The NBC poll was great, also. They're all good.
I was on the set of Meet the Press when they showed that.
I mean, we're leading in all of them. So I think something like that could absolutely happen, and it would be my honor.
All right, now I'm not perfect, I like to say. I'm just the best on radio, and you weren't so happy with me last time, so I want to go back to foreign affairs now, but with fair warning. No gotchas, no tricks.
OK.
Pakistan is the most dangerous country in the world, long term, other than Iran, because it's got 90 or more nuclear weapons, and they got the Taliban. If it goes unstable, and you're the president, Donald Trump, what are you going to do?
Well, number one, it is probably the most dangerous, because of the fact it has the nukes. And you know, you might add North Korea to that group, because they have a total madman. At least in Pakistan, you have some semblance of sanity at this moment. But it could go rogue, and something like that could happen. And I think you have to get, and it's involved right now anyway, but you have to get India involved. India's the check to Pakistan. And you have to get India involved. They have their own nukes, they have a very powerful army. They seem to be the real checkmate. They seem to be the real group, and I would start talking at that level very, very quickly. But look, you cannot have a rogue group with nukes. You can't have it. We've got it already. You know, one of the things I brought up at the debate, I got no credit for it, and now everybody's talking about it, is North Korea. I said wait a minute, folks, we're talking now, during the debate, and I think you remember, I think you remember when I mentioned it.
Yes, I do. Yes, I do.
I said we're talking so much about Iran, and they don't have nukes at this moment. They might have them fairly quickly based on this ridiculous deal that was made, but they don't have nukes. You have a madman over in North Korea who actually has nukes and he says he's going to use them. Every two weeks, he pops up and says he's going to use them. Nobody ever talks about it. So since I said that, I've noticed that Rubio and others have been talking more about North Korea. You have a lot of hot spots, but Pakistan is a serious problem. They have weapons that work, and they have a lot of them, and I think we have to deal very closely with India having to do with Pakistan.
No, that, I agree with that. Would you be prepared to send American troops, as President Obama did to get Osama bin Laden, to go and get their nukes if it became an unstable...
Well, let me tell you, Hugh, it's so important to me. If I won, I don't want to be talking to Hugh Hewitt and all of these people about what I want to do. You have to have a certain, you know, people can't know exactly what your intentions are. And I tell people the process that we have is so ridiculous -- give your exact, what are you going to do against ISIS, what are you going to do against this. Well, you want to have a certain amount of, you want to have a little bit of guess work for the enemy. And I just don't want to be telling people, and this is, by the way, this has nothing to do with lack of knowledge, because I think I know as much about Pakistan as most other people. But I will tell you, I don't want to broadcast my intentions. I don't want to have, I'm so transparent, I'm so open, here's what we're going to do. They have to guess. They have to be able to say you know, he's unpredictable. One of the articles came out recently about my business dealings, and a very respected man said that Trump is one of the greatest businessmen in the world, because he's totally unpredictable. We never know what he's going to do. And you know what? I want to be unpredictable with this, too. I don't want to be like Obama, where he's always saying you know, we're going to do, in two weeks, we're going to do this, and then we're going to do that. And I'm saying to myself, can you imagine General Douglas MacArthur or General Patton, they're spinning in their graves. So when you talk about Pakistan, and let's say they go rogue, I don't want to really be saying what my initial thought is. Also, my initial thought may be much different from what I want to do at the time. But I want them to not know what my thought process is. Does that make any sense to you?
It makes perfect sense. It's Nixonian, actually, and I said that the last time, even in the interview that people thought you'd stumbled around in, I said actually, he gave a very Nixonian answer on China. You just did again. Last question, you did not get to answer the global warming question. We ran out of time. And again, 11 people on the stage, you got the most time, but it was still not enough time for everyone. Do you believe that the temperature of the Earth is increasing? And what would you do if you do believe that, vis-a-vis global climate change?
Well, first of all, I'm not a believer in global warming. And I'm not a believer in man-made global warming. It could be warming, and it's going to start to cool at some point. And you know, in the early, in the 1920s, people talked about global cooling. I don't know if you know that or not. They thought the Earth was cooling. Now, it's global warming. And actually, we've had times where the weather wasn't working out, so they changed it to extreme weather, and they have all different names, you know, so that it fits the bill. But the problem we have, and if you look at our energy costs, and all of the things that we're doing to solve a problem that I don't think in any major fashion exists. I mean, Obama thinks it's the number one problem of the world today. And I think it's very low on the list. So I am not a believer, and I will, unless somebody can prove something to me, I believe there's weather. I believe there's change, and I believe it goes up and it goes down, and it goes up again. And it changes depending on years and centuries, but I am not a believer, and we have much bigger problems. You know, I talk about global warming. You know, to me, the worst global warming, and I mentioned this to you once before, is nuclear warming. That's our global warming. That's what I see, because we have incompetent people, and we have these rogue nations, and not even rogue nations anymore. You know, we had a case where Vladimir Putin about three months ago threw out the nuke word. And I never thought I'd hear that from a Russia. But he said they'd better, essentially, they'd better be careful, because you know, we are a nuclear nation. That was a hell of a statement for him to make. And that's a statement that's made because of a lack of respect.
Donald Trump, it's great to have you back. I assume you'll be back again?
I will. I will. You're very fair, and I appreciated what you said about me during the debate.
Donald, good to talk to you.
That was very much appreciated.
You're still the best interview in America.
Well, you'd better believe that.
I told that to Politico over the weekend. If they gave me Tiger, Oprah and Donald every day, I'd open with Donald every day. Thank you, Donald Trump.
Ah, that's beautiful. For you to say that is beautiful. I appreciate it, and we will be back.
Take care.
Thanks, Hugh, bye.
Well, the CNN poll is sort of the one that we relied on because the problem with the Zogby poll although you are winning in both of them, I give that to you as well is that a Zogby is an online poll. So that's why we lean more towards the CNN poll which you are indeed winning as well.
No, NBC just came out with one 29 percent and even above that. So, you know, there is plenty of polls, that's for sure. I don't know why these people hire pollsters when you have polls coming out every 15 minutes but the polls have been terrific.
All right. Let me turn now to the latest. It's the Muslim issue. And that's certainly generating some controversy. I don't know if you know but Dr. Ben Carson this weekend said that he would not support a Muslim for president. What's your thought about this controversy?
Well, I have a lot of respect for Ben Carson and I like him a lot. And we have had a very good relationship. I think that basically if somebody can get elected. You know, they are going to be vetted and if somebody can get elected that's what it is all about. It's an electoral process. I would tend to go along with that.
Do I take from that that if properly vetted that you wouldn't have a problem voting with someone who is Muslim, provided the person agreed with you politically?
Well, they would have to go through the long hard process. It's a long, tough road, Greta, I can tell you, and it really is very revealing. And I would have no problem with it, no.
You know --
I know one thing, he is not going to defend me. If somebody says something about me, Greta, he is not defending me. That I know for sure.
You don't think calling someone robotic -
Greta, that's not a personal -- no, no, I don't think.
All right, the question I asked Governor Chris Christie the other day, if you had 15 minutes with the Pope who is visiting the United States this week, what would you -- just the two of you, what would you talk about? What would you ask him?
Well, I'll talk to him about a lot of things mostly religion. But I would ask his views on global warming. Because believe it or not, he seems to be getting extremely political and he seems to feel strongly about the whole global warming situation, which I disagree with him on. And I would actually talk to him about that to see if he is serious about it?
Donald, nice to talk to you. Thank you, sir, for joining us.
Thank you very much, Greta.
We were with you in New Hampshire when that man stood up.
Yes.
And said we have a problem in this country, and it's Muslims. You let that pass. I wonder what that tells us about you.
Well, he said much more than that. He went on to say other things. It was part of the statement. He then went on to say other things.
But the bigotry part.
Look. He said mostly about Obama. That whole question is about that. I don't have to defend President Obama. He is not going to defend me. So whether you agree or don't agree, and there were people in that audience as you probably notice, that did agree with him.
It was a testing moment for a man running for president.
I don't think so.
You never know when they are coming.
I don't think so.
The problem in this country is Muslims?
Well, let me ask you this. So you said there is a problem in this country and it's Muslims. All right. I love the Muslims. I have many, many friends, people living in this building are Muslims. And they are phenomenal people. Unlike everything else, you have people where there are problems. Now, we can say there no problems with the Muslims, there's no problem, there is no terrorism, there is crimes, and there is no anything. They didn't knock down the World Trade Center. To the best of my knowledge, the people that knocked down the World Trade Center, they didn't fly back to Sweden.
This is the last time you ever have to address this question if you hit the ball. OK.
Go ahead.
There is like sauce all over my hand. This meatball is so good.
I want to hear this.
Barack Obama born in the United States, was he? It's a meatball. It's hanging out there. Right there. Come on.
You want to know, I don't talk about it anymore. I talk about jobs. I talk about our veterans being horribly treated. I just don't discuss it.
Donald, you know, it's always exciting to -- to have celebrities with us, and I have my most important celebrity sitting on the front row, and my mom is here with us tonight, Francis Scott.
Beautiful. Hello, Francis. She did a good job. She did a good job. Look at this guy.
I -- I am blessed with her, I am blessed with her. Well, as you know, Donald, the way that this works is I ask questions from the audience members...
OK.
... presented and submitted the questions, so my goal is to make sure that we get through as many of these questions as possible. But we're not looking for sound bites; we're looking for thorough answers.
Good.
There are so many people who have the same question. I -- I know one of that from Hanahan and other, have similar question on the issue of immigration; securing our borders, without any question, is one of your top priorities that we've heard you talk about. I -- I'd also ask you, go into a little depth of how you would you secure the border?
OK.
Barry Walker from ERMO and Scott Williams, both here somewhere in the audience, had very similar questions about how to make America great again economically.
Yes.
I -- I know that next Thursday you're coming out with your plan from an economic perspective. If you were to give us a glimpse of what we can expect from Trump in the White House...
OK.
Haley Meacham from Spartanburg has a question. As you look at our foreign policy, and frankly, the failure of our foreign policy, the so-called Red Line in Syria...
Terrible.
Donald, you -- you are now talking Matt Schillinger's language. Matt from Columbia had a very specific question...
Yes.
Carl Heddleson from Charleston asked a question, you know, we have a challenge with the size, the scope, of the federal government. There are so many departments that need to be scrutinized; FDA, EPA, IRS, one of the questions he has here is where would you start scrutinizing the agency, and can you name a couple?
Well, EPA is one that's -- you saw a couple of weeks ago, where they opened the door and the river's destroyed, you know, I mean, it wasn't even the people that did it...
Talk to us about the right to work and the laws that we have...
Got to have right to work, got to have right to work. What they put you through was incredible actually. To -- to think that Boeing almost could have said, "Hey, we're not coming."
Are you going to stick around and talk to some folks afterwards?
All night. How about all night?
Romney took about four percent.
Yes. Four or five percent
If you get to 25 percent...
The election's over.
I'll think about it, then. We'll -- we'll -- we'll think about it.
I -- I, you know what is interesting, the media and politics, much different than the media in finance. Maybe finance is easier because it's a little more numbers-based. But I've met some wonderful people in the media and politics but I've met some really dishonest media folks in having to do with politics so it's, toy know, a really mixed bag. But actually I think that politics is much more deceptive than business or real estate, it's much, much more deceptive. Not an easy life, I will tell you, that's why a lot of people said, "What do you want to do this for?" But it's not an easy life. I met some wonderful people and I've met some really bad dudes and people.
Fair enough.
Are you shocked to hear that, by the way?
With us now by phone, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Donald, we read quiet a few polls; you're ahead in all of them. Of course, you would tell us. Especially I want to focus on the one in Florida right now. You're a good bit ahead in Florida, and despite all that good news, you seem to be at war with many people on the right. Why is that?
Well, I don't think war. I like to be treated fairly and have a good relationship, as you know, Joe, with many, many people. But I like to be treated fairly and when I'm not fairly treated I let people know it. I don't think that's -- I don't think it's a war.
What's going on with Fox News? You know, you and Roger have been friends for a long time. There was a misunderstanding after the first debate, you guys patched it up. But now you're saying you're not going on Fox News again and they say it's because they won't bow down to your demands. What's the truth there?
Well, I don't think I've been treated fairly on Fox News. Now, you know, it's sort an amazing thing because I'm leading every single one of the poles. I guess their poll just came out. I was told I'm leading that poll by a substantial margin. But I don't think I'm being treated fairly on Fox News and I let them know that and I'm not going to be doing it for a while.
Well, Donald, the thing is you're right now at odds with Fox News. We know how powerful they are in the Republican Party. And you're at war with Rich Lowery, who is the editor of "National Review", which is really sort of the gold standard of conservative magazine.
I don't think anybody reads it, Joe. I think it has no power whatsoever, I'll be honest. I think it has no power whatsoever. And he's not a respected guy.
It's just, you know, you never hear people say it about men.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
We never hear that word said about men.
She's gotten very loud and obnoxious and, frankly, I know many men that become very loud and obnoxious also. But I've noticed that she -- I don't know, there's something going on with her. There's really something going on. I think she's going to make a terrible candidate just as she was a terrible Secretary of State.
I mean, would you call any of your male competitors in the Republican race, would you call them shrill? Have you called them shrill? It's just that, to women, when you use a word like shrill --
No, but I would. I would call Rand Paul shrill.
-- it definitely sounds sexist.
Katty, I would call Rand Paull Ssrill. I think he's shrill. I don't think that's a term that applies exclusively to women at all.
Donald, you're doing very well in Florida and you activated actually both parties in much of the country to talk about immigration over the course of your campaign. But CBS Miami this morning reports that Mar-a-Lago, your beloved Mar-a-Lago, you've requested anywhere from -- at Mar-a-Lago, they've requested anywhere from 70-90 H-2b visas a year since the year 2008 to hire workers at an average pay of $10-12 an hour. Why would you be importing workers from overseas rather than hiring workers from Florida?
Because during the season, Mar-a-Lago is a seasonal job, which is very hard to get people in Florida for seasonal jobs. And during the season, in Palm Beach, Palm Beach is probably the hottest real-estate maybe in the world. And during the season in Palm Beach, it's very, very hard to get help. You can't, you know, we're talking about Mar-a-Lago the club is closed for the summer. You know, the expression "Rich people don't like heat." And we close Mar-a-Lago and we open October -- like October 1st. And from that, for about a five month period during what they call the Palm Beach Season, which is a big deal, you can't get help. So we tend to get help from different places including Europe. And we've been doing that -- by the way, these are all legal visas, you understand that, right?
Yes, yes, I do.
These are all legal visas, but they -- we have to bring people in, which tells you, I mean, you can have jobs out there in certain communities that are doing well. But in Palm Beach, getting help in Palm Beach during the season is almost impossible. So we go through a very legal process and bring people in through legal visas.
Donald, it's Donny. How are you, sir?
Hi, Donny.
Hey Donald, it's Willie.
Hi Willie.
Donald, we got to let you go, but really quickly, before you go, you had an interview with Scott Pelley, "60 Minutes". He kept asking you about birtherism. You kept brushing it off saying you weren't going to talk about that anymore. Are you not going to talk about that anymore?
I don't talk about that anymore, Joe. You know what I talk about? Hey Joe, I talk about the vets. I talk about what we're going to do to bring jobs back. I talk about the military. I don't talk about it anymore. And the problem with talking about it, you talk about it, that's all people want to talk about. They don't want to get on to trade with China, how we're getting killed. They don't want to get on to how badly treated the vets are. They don't want to talk about immigration. So I don't talk about it anymore. I talk about jobs and other things.
So you're not going to talk about it at all the rest of this campaign?
I don't talk about it, Joe. I mean, people ask me a question and I say I want to talk about jobs, I want to talk about trade, I want to talk about other things. And you know what? They immediately go on to it.
Hopefully, we will have a campaign that does focus on jobs and trade and Syria and Russia.
I agree.
Issues that matter. All right, Donald Trump, thank you so much for being with us. We greatly appreciate it as always.
Thank you very much.
Joining us now on the phone is GOP front-runner, Donald Trump. Good morning, Mr. Trump.
Hi, Alisyn.
Hi. Long time no talk. Nice to have you on.
It's been a long time. But that's great.
OK, let's talk about your plan, because it's a two-parter. You talk about building a wall. And then you talk --
Build a wall, that's right.
Sure. And then you talk about deporting the 11 to 12 million undocumented workers who are here --
Illegal immigrants.
Illegal immigrants who are living here. That's the part that you have not been terribly specific about. How would you specifically go about doing 11 million mass deportations?
Through good management and through a process. And the process is the bad ones go and they never come back. They're never coming back.
Yes.
The really good ones -- and there are many -- they will go and they will come back legally. They will come back on an expedited system. And they'll come back legally, Alisyn.
OK, but when you say --
You know, if you go into the 1950s, Dwight Eisenhower, who was a respected president, was doing the same thing. He had to get rid of the illegal immigrants and he did that. He got them out of the country.
But when you say --
There were a lot of problems. It was done in the 1950s by Dwight Eisenhower.
But let's talk about what it looks like nowadays. Would you use the National Guard? Would you use the police, the Army?
I would use different forms and it will take place and it will be done effectively and warmly and humanely. And a lot of people will be very happy about it. You know that I had a good Hispanic poll the other day because the Hispanics, as an example, don't want to see -- you know, the ones that are here legally don't want to see this where everyone is pouring into the country illegally.
Sure -- Look --
We're going to have to do something about it. You know, you use the word "illegal immigrant." That's what it is. You're illegally in the country. So we have to do something about it. We're going to build a wall. We're going to let people in, but they're going to come in legally.
Look -- I mean, Mr. Trump, yes, they are here illegally, but often they've been invited in. I mean, you know what our history is with undocumented workers, they've been given jobs, they often pay taxes.
Right. And they've been coming back legally.
I mean --
Alisyn, they're going to be coming back in, but they're going to be coming back in legally.
But, Mr. Trump, I want you to specifically explain how you are going to get rid of them. Because you know what this hearkens to? What it reminds me at least of, is remember the case of Elian Gonzalez where the little Cuban boy, there was this dispute about he belonged in Cuba, he was Cuban, and the federal agents went into his apartment and it was splashed all over the media and it gripped the nation because you watched federal agents pull this boy from his extended family. And you are talking about doing that with 11 million people. Are you going to separate families?
No, we're not separating families. We're taking the families and we're taking them as a unit and we did it with -- Dwight Eisenhower did it with over 1 million people in the 1950s and it was something that was done -- You know, now we're a politically correct society. We can't do anything -- we're more abound -- we're a society that can't do anything anymore. We can't function anymore. We have millions of people in the country illegally --
Yes, so you're prepared to use the police?
-- tremendous problems -- Listen, they're not paying taxes. They're taking jobs from other people. We have a country that desperately needs jobs. They're taking jobs from other people.
Look, no one wants the criminal aspect. You're with everyone.
And by the way, do you know that the gangs that you see, all of these terrible gangs that you see, many of those gangs are made up of illegal immigrants and they're tough dudes. And by the way, they're going -- day one they're going to be out of here, we're going to get rid of them day one.
OK. Let's talk --
The rest is, the good people, they're going and they're coming back in an expedited way. They're going to come back legally. And you watch with good management how nicely that could work.
Well, look. I know what you're referring to, the East Anglia situation where they -- a couple of scientists --
It was terrible. It was absolutely terrible.
-- using the wrong data.
I'm not even saying that. I'm saying this -- I believe in clean air, immaculate air. I believe in clean water. All of those things. But I don't think we can destroy our country. If we have climate change or global warming, it's going to be of the nuclear form because we have incompetent politicians watching over us when it comes to nuclear weapons. That's our big problem.
Listen. That's not what I heard her say. What I heard her say about the Charleston, South Carolina, event what that -- What was surprising about it, there was mostly white people. So this was the African-American Chamber of Commerce, but that it was populated mostly by a white audience.
Well, they had many African-Americans, they had many white people, too. But the room was full. They all rushed to the front, I mean, which was a great honor. I let them stand there. They stood there the whole speech. But, you know, she showed empty seats. Well, of course, there were empty seats because the people are standing in the front of the room. So it was just another hit job, but it's one of those things -- I guess you get used to it after awhile. Honestly, Alisyn, a terrible reporter.
Mr. Trump, I think she's a wonderful reporter.
All right. Then you and I disagree on something.
It is.
But in dealing and in making speeches to thousands of Evangelicals and taking questions -- they're very hurt by the president, there's no question about it.
But do you agree that President Obama is pretending to be a Christian?
I don't get involved in people's faith, Alisyn. It's not for me to discuss his faith. That's for him to discuss. I don't get involved in his faith.
Let's talk about what's going on with you and Fox News. Why are you in this spat with them?
Well, only because Fox News has not treated me fairly.
Yeah.
So I will correct people. I believe in that.
I know that that's your slogan, Mr. Trump, is "Make America great again, " and I'm curious, when was America great? In your mind, when was the heyday? What was the year that America was great?
Well, it's been hurt badly. I mean, honestly -- and it's before this president, too. Going into Iraq was a tremendous mistake. By the way, I was the only one with a vision of all of these candidates -- I was the one with the vision, don't do it. But going into Iraq was a tremendous mistake for our country. It destabilized the Middle East. And that was Bush's role. It destabilized the Middle East. Iran is taking over Iraq, they're going to take over those massive oil reserves, everything else. And by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of them, too. That was a bad mistake and I think that has been --
Yeah. And you are on the record about that.
I think Iraq has been -- You know, we spent $2 trillion -- Instead of rebuilding our country, we spent $2 trillion, thousands of lives, wounded warriors all over -- who I love.
Of course. You are on the record that the Iraq war was a mistake. So prior to the Iraq War, are you saying the Clinton years were when America was great?
I would say that Reagan, that Clinton, it was -- We didn't -- the country wasn't decimated like it is now. The country didn't owe $19 trillion, Alisyn. The country -- I mean, right now, we owe $1.5 trillion to China. We owe $1.5 trillion to Japan. Think of it, they suck our money out, they suck our jobs out and we owe them. That's like a magic trick. Right? We owe them. So we owe them $1.5 trillion each and yet they do nothing but take our money.
Mr. Trump, very quickly, back to Fox News for a second. Don't you need Fox News viewers and Fox News to win the primary?
I don't know. I mean, honestly, I really don't know. I'm on "60 Minutes " on Sunday and "60 Minutes, " I mean, I don't know if it's going to be a good show or a bad show. But I'm on "60 Minutes " and it's a very powerful show. I went on, as you know, "Stephen Colbert " the other night and he killed the ratings. The ratings were the highest they've had in -- just massive ratings. And it killed "The Tonight Show, " I mean, by a lot --
Yeah. I watched that. I watched that and he serves you up what he called "a big old meatball of a softball " to ask you whether or not, once and for all, you believe that President Obama was born in the United States now that you have seen his birth certificate, and you didn't want to answer it. Why not?
No, I don't answer that question. I don't talk about that question because it diverts everything -- I talk about jobs, I talk about our military, I talk about helping our vets. I don't talk about that question. It's just something I won't talk about anymore because every time people get onto that question, that's all they want to talk about is the birth certificate and was it real, was it not real? Everything -- All they want to talk about is that. So I don't talk about it. What I talk about is jobs, I talk about our vets who, by the way, are living like third class citizens and I'll straighten it out. I talk about many other things. I talk about trade, but I don't talk about that subject.
What do you think of that plan?
Well, first of all, I think he's a nice person. And, you know, honestly, I can understand how he feels. I came into Iowa -- everyone said that Scott Walker was going to win Iowa -- I came into Iowa. And almost immediately, I was just killing him at the polls and beating him in Iowa. With the crowds, with the polls, with everything. And they say that it was my entering the race that destroyed his campaign. I didn't go after Scott Walker very much. But for whatever reason, when I came in, he went down. And then he went down to almost nothing. He went down to zero. And he was leading. He was like I am now. I don't want to have the same result happen. But be very careful that it doesn't happen. But Scott Walker was actually leading and went down to zero. So obviously, he made a lot of mistakes. But the thing that hurt him, I guess, according to what they're all saying, was me. So I can understand fully what he's saying. I mean, I do understand it.
Of course.
Being unpredictable is a good thing, not a bad thing.
Look, I understand wanting to be unpredictable with the enemy and not telegraph to them exactly what we're doing, but for voters --
I know, but when I start talking, they want to know answers. And I will give answers generally because you have to do that, unfortunately, to get elected.
Yes, for voters. I mean, voters want to know what your strategy is.
But I know more about -- Don't forget, Alisyn -- and you remember this -- I was the one that said don't go into Iraq. That is was 2003 and 2004.
Yes, but how do you now know more about Syria than Marco Rubio?
Look, Marco Rubio sits behind a desk sometimes and he reads stuff, he's in committees so -- that's all he does. I create jobs all day long. I'll know more about all of this than all of them put together and believe me, we'll have a winning strategy. If Marco Rubio is good, how come we're doing so badly? He's a sitting U.S. Senator, so --
He's on the Foreign Relations Committee.
-- why doesn't he do something about it? I'm not in government. He is in government.
But will you clue in the voters as to what you will do? Or do you just want people to trust you?
I'm going to clue them in because I have to to a certain extent. But I don't want -- If I win this thing, I don't want the other side to know what my views are, where I'm coming from, what I do. I watch Obama saying we're going to do this, we're going to do that. Every time they kill a mid-level accounting person from ISIS, they have a news conference to announce it instead of being quiet about it for a few months and knocking off -- Then everybody else scrambles. And you can't get anybody else. You got to be cool and you got to be unpredictable. And you just can't go in and say exactly here's my plan. And I do have plans. And by the way, plans are always subject to massive change. And they change. You got to win. And I know how to win. These guys don't know how to win. Marco Rubio, he's like a kid. He shouldn't even be running in this race, as far as I'm concerned. He's a kid.
I want to ask you about something funny and that is that "Saturday Night Live " has just announced who will be playing you this season. It's their comedian Taran Killam. He's really funny and clever. He does all sorts of different impersonations. I believe he's played John Boehner, he's played Tom Brady. He's played a whole variety. Are you familiar with his work?
I am, yes.
What do you think about that he's going to be parodying you?
Well, I look forward to that. "Saturday Night Live " is terrific. And I look forward to it and I hope he does a good job. And Darrell Hammond was great. I thought Darrell was fantastic. So I hope he does a good job.
Darrell Hammond did do an impeccable Donald Trump. Don't you think?
He was very good. He was. A nice guy, too. I see him around. Very, very nice guy. But we was very good. People really related to that somehow. I'm not sure that I always benefited, to be honest with you, but --
But you saw the similarity.
I saw the similarity with Darrell -- I saw the similarity. He was -- I thought he was terrific, but we're going to see what happens. I mean, I'll let you know. I'm not sure I'll like it. But you know what? If I don't like it, I'll let you know.
OK. I would like to know that. Has SNL asked you to go on this season? Would you consider it?
I'm not allowed to say that.
Oh, really, why is that?
Because I'm not allowed to say that.
Because you're in negotiations with them?
Well, I'm just not allowed to say it. I mean, I have -- silencio. I can't speak about it.
Silencio.
Which, perhaps, you understand what that means.
I believe I am reading you loud and clear. It's always interesting, Mr. Trump, when you won't answer something because --
I know. People don't understand it, they get totally confused when I don't answer something.
Well, Donald Trump, great to get your comments on all of this. We appreciate talking to you. We appreciate having you on NEW DAY. And please do keep us posted when you can talk about some of the things that you didn't want to reveal today.
I will, Alisyn. And thank you very much. A great honor.
Thanks so much.
Thank you.
So, now you've got everybody's attention.
I do have their attention.
Revolution is easy, governing is hard. And what I'd like to get to is how you intend to govern the country if you are elected president. What's your tax plan?
It's a substantial reduction for the middle-income people, because our middle class, Scott, is being absolutely decimated. It will be a corporate also reduction, I think it'll be a great incentive for corporations.
Who are you going to raise taxes on?
If you look at actual raise, some very wealthy are going to be raised. Some people that are getting unfair deductions are going to be raised. But overall it's going to be a tremendous incentive to grow the economy and we're going to take in the same or more money. And I think we're going to have something that's going to be spectacular.
But Republicans don't raise taxes.
Well, we're not raising taxes.
What kind of Republican are you?
I mean the only -- well, I'm a pretty good Republican. But I will tell you this, I do have some differences. I don't want to have certain people on Wall Street getting away with paying no tax.
You say you're going to lower taxes on the middle class, what are we talking about?
Well, we're talking about numbers that will be announced over the next two days. And they'll be significant for the middle class.
Do you know what the numbers are?
I know them right now.
Well, why don't you tell me? This is 60 MINUTES.
I know.
It's time to tell the folks at home --
I know.
-- the details of what you intend to do.
Well, I -- I will say this, there will be a large segment of our country that will have a zero rate, a zero rate. And that's something I haven't told anybody.
You're talking about --
We're talking about people in the low-income brackets that are supposed to be paying taxes, many of them don't anyway.
You're talking about making part of the population exempt from income tax?
That is correct.
You're talking about cutting corporate income taxes?
That is correct.
But there's a nineteen trillion dollar federal debt.
That's right. We're going to grow the economy so much --
You can't afford to do those things --
-- no, no, but if the economy grows the way it should grow, if I bring jobs back from China, from Japan, from Mexico, from so many countries, everybody's taking our jobs.
How do you get them back --
You get them back --
-- those twenty dollar an hour jobs that this country was built on?
Right. Exactly. You get 'em back by taking them away from other countries. I mean, if you look at China, we have --
How does the President do that?
Well, the President does it by not allowing places like China to devaluate -- you know, they devalue their currency, Scott, to such an extent that it's impossible for our companies to compete. Every time they do that, they suck the blood right out of our country.
You're not running for president of China.
No, I'm running --
You're not going to be able to prevent the devaluation --
Oh, absolutely. Sure you are. Sure you are.
-- of the currency.
Look, they don't respect our President. They don't respect our country. They will respect me. They won't be doing it. But here's what we have to do. If they don't come to the table, they're going to have a tax when they put their products into this country. And they're going to behave.
So you would tax their --
I would --
-- products coming into the United States.
I don't want to tax anything.
You're talking about a trade war.
I'm talking about a fair war. I'm talking about -- also, I have the smartest people on Wall Street lined up already. They're going to represent us on Japan, on Mexico. Mexico, by the way, is taking our jobs. I love the Mexican people. They're great people. But the leadership is too smart for our country. Ford Motor Company, moving a two and half billion dollar plant to Mexico. Mexico --
But there's nothing you can do about that as president.
Sure there is.
You can't -- how do you keep them from exporting American jobs to Mexico?
Let's say Ford -- let's say Ford moves to Mexico. If they want to sell that car in the United States, they pay a tax. Here's what's going to happen, they're not going to build their plant there. They're going to build it in the United States.
But there is a North American Free Trade Agreement.
And there shouldn't be. It's a disaster.
But it is there.
OK, yes, but --
And if you're president, you're going to have to live with it.
Excuse me, we will either renegotiate it or we will break it. Because, you know, every agreement has an end.
You can't just break the law.
Excuse me, every agreement has an end. Every agreement has to be fair. Every agreement has a defraud clause. We're being defrauded by all these countries.
It's called free trade --
No, no it's not.
-- and it is a plank --
It's not the --
This sounds -- this sounds great. How are you going to pay for it?
We're going to absolutely be able to pay for it. My economy will expand so rapidly -- we're going to take jobs back from other countries, and we will be able to pay for it.
Are you serious about deporting twelve million illegal immigrants?
Well, nobody knows the number. But the answer is -- you just said it, they're illegal immigrants. They're here illegally. First of all, I have to start a little bit differently. We're going to build a wall and we're going to create a border. It's going to be a great wall and it's not going to be very expensive. And it's going to be peanuts compared to the kind of numbers, you know.
How are you going to build a wall --
It's called management.
-- that is cheap and impenetrable?
It will be a real wall. It'll be a wall that works. It'll actually be a wall that will look good, believe it or not. Because what they have now is a joke. They're -- they're ugly, little and don't work.
Let's assume your wall has gone up.
Good.
Eleven, twelve million illegal immigrants --
Or whatever the number is.
Still in the country, what do you do?
If they've done well, they're going out and they're coming back in legally. Because you said it --
You're rounding them all up?
We're rounding them up in a very humane way, in a very nice way. And they're going to be happy because they want to be legalized. And, by the way, I know it doesn't sound nice, but not everything is nice, somebody has to do it.
It doesn't sound practical.
It is practical. It's going to work. They have to come here legally. And, you know, when I talk about the wall, and I said it before, we're going to have a tremendous, beautiful, wide-open door. Nice big door. We want people to come into the country.
You know, the problem with a lot of these ideas is that the president of the United States is not the CEO of America.
That's right.
The Constitution is going to tell you no.
We'll see.
The Congress is going to tell you no.
We'll see.
The Supreme Court is going to tell you no.
Well, we'll see.
And you're not used to working in an environment like that.
Look, I do it all the time.
Who tells you no?
I do it all the time. Not that many people -- I do it all the time. And I deal with governments all the time. I have -- overseas, I have vast holdings overseas.
What is the role of the U.S. military in the world?
I want to have a military that's so strong, so powerful, so modern, has the greatest equipment in the world and that everybody says we're not going to mess with them. And we don't have that now.
When has the U.S. military been too small to accomplish its mission?
It's not a question of too small.
We're --
We don't have leadership.
We're at war with ISIS as we sit here. How do you end it?
I would end ISIS forcefully. I think ISIS, what they did was unbelievable what they did with James Foley and the cutting off of heads of everybody. I mean these people are -- are totally a disaster. Now, let me just say this, ISIS in Syria, Assad in Syria, Assad and ISIS are mortal enemies. We go in to fight ISIS. Why aren't we letting ISIS go and fight Assad and then we pick up the remnants? Why are we doing this? We're fighting ISIS and Assad has to be saying to himself, they have the nicest or dumbest people that I've ever imagined.
Let me get this right, so we lay off ISIS for now?
Excuse me, let --
OK, that's Syria. What do you -- do in Iraq --
With that --
-- with ISIS?
Look with ISIS in Iraq, you got to knock them out. You got to knock them out.
How do you do that?
You got to fight them. You got to fight them. You have to stand --
On the ground?
If you need, you're going to have to do that, yes.
You would drop a bomb on their nuclear reactor?
I would do something. You have to do something about North Korea. Now what I would do is I would make China respect us because China has extreme control over North Korea. And I would say, China, you better go in there and you better do something because economically it could cause China --
And they're going to listen to Donald Trump?
Yeah, they're going to listen to me.
They don't listen to the president of the United States --
They're going to listen to me.
-- but Donald Trump, they're going to listen?
Just like I have the Chinese banks in my buildings, they listen to me, they respect me. China has almost complete control over North Korea. China will do that. And if they don't do that, they have to suffer economically because we have the engine that makes China work. You know, without the United States or without China sucking out all our money and our jobs, China would collapse in about two minutes.
What's your plan for Obamacare?
Obamacare's going to be repealed and replaced. Obamacare is a disaster if you look at what's going on with premiums where they're up forty-five, fifty, fifty-five percent.
So how do you fix it?
There's many different ways, by the way. Everybody's got to be covered. This is an un-Republican thing for me to say because a lot of times they say, no, no, the lower twenty-five percent that can't afford private. But --
Universal health care.
I am going to take care of everybody. I don't care if it costs me votes or not. Everybody's going to be taken care of much better than they're taken care of now.
The uninsured person --
Right.
-- is going to be taken care of. How? How?
They're going to be taken care of. I would make a deal with existing hospitals to take care of people. And, you know what? This is probably --
Make a deal? Who pays for it?
The government's going to pay for it. But we're going to save so much money on the other side. But for the most part, it's going to be a private plan and people are going to be able to go out and negotiate great plans with lots of different competition with lots of competitors with great companies and they can have their doctors, they can have plans, they can have everything.
In your book, "The America We Deserve " you proposed raising the Social Security retirement age to seventy. Is that still your plan?
Yeah, not anymore because now what I want to do is take money back from other countries that are killing us and I want to save Social Security. And we're going to save it without increases. We're not going to raise the age and it will be just fine.
How are you going to do that? It is a basket case.
Through capability. We will set it up by making our country rich again.
You know, the heart of all of your plans seems to be we're going to be rich.
We are going to do great. As a country, we are going to do great.
You know, neither party likes you very much. How are you going to get --
I would say that's true, yes.
How are you going to get anything through Congress?
Well, when you say the party, the establishment doesn't. For instance, I noticed that --
Well, that's who Congress is.
That's OK. I'll get along.
How are you going to get anything --
I've gotten along with politicians my whole life. I've made a fortune on politicians. Nobody knows politicians better than I do. I get along with politicians.
You're not going to be able to buy them anymore.
No, no, I'm not going to buy them. I'm not going to buy them. I'll get along with them. You got to get along and you got to get people to do what you -- it's called leadership. We don't have any leadership right now.
You love hearing about yourself.
I do.
It is oxygen to you. What does that tell us about Donald Trump?
No, if I'm on a show, I'll turn on the show. But I don't think I'm any different than anybody else. If somebody's --
I was in your office, all the magazines on your desk --
Well, I have a lot of covers.
-- a re covers of you.
I think I have more covers --
All the pictures on the wall are pictures of you.
Well, it's cheaper than wallpaper.
What are we supposed to take from that?
You know, look, I'm on a lot of covers. I think maybe more than almost any supermodel. I think more than any supermodel. But in a way that is a sign of respect, people are respecting what you are doing.
So this is the corner office at Fifth Avenue and Fifty Seventh.
That's right.
An impression is created though that you like to dish it out but you can't take a punch.
Oh, I think I can take it. I could take it if it's fair. Again, if people say things that are false, which happens a lot with me -- if people say things that are false I will fight, like, harder than anybody. If I do something wrong -- and that happens -- and they write a fair story that I did something wrong, there's nothing to fight about. I can handle that. I don't like lying. You know, I'm a very honorable guy, I don't like lies.
Very accomplished, your three older children.
Terrific people. But I say, no drugs, no alcohol, no cigarettes.
Millions of people are wondering right now whether you are serious or whether this is a reality show. Yesterday you said if the presidency doesn't work out, I'll go back to my business.
Well, that's true.
Do you intend --
I mean, that's true. I can't guarantee --
You know what makes people uncomfortable about you?
Tell me.
People say, look, this is a guy who calls someone a loser. He'll say something and they say that that's childish. But they say that that's childish. They say, that's not the temperament of a president.
It probably is childish. But you know, what, this is a campaign.
Right.
Employed. And you must sort of --
They don't count you as an employed when you are.
Right. We have millions, tens of millions of people that couldn't find a job and they are now considered essentially employed. So, we're going to do something that's really great. And this is the thing I like the most. I'm going to put people to work. I'm going to be great for business. I'll be great for business.
Uh-huh.
And we're going to have an economy that really is going to be hot.
You -- will you pay more money? Will it be millions and millions, hundreds of millions? How much more will you pay?
I will probably end up paying more money but, at the same time, I think the economy will do better, so I'm making up that way. But I will probably end up paying more money. I believe in the end, I might do better. Because I really believe the economy is going to go boom, beautiful.
So, there's a couple of ways when you cut a lot of taxes, you can make up for it, right. You can close loopholes to make up money that way.
Correct. And we are doing that.
How can you get there without --
Well, you know what, you have to do that because I will, he would be very concerned. If you do that you're not going to stop housing production and housing has had a lot of problems and you've reported better on it than anybody during the years. But you can't take a chance on that. I mean, people need the mortgage deduction, mortgage interest deduction.
So, where do you get the money if not --
Well -- interest, but one of the ways you're going to get it is, in my opinion, you know, one of the wage you're really going to get is, look, you know, many of your friends, they are hedge fund guys and you have the carried interest deduction. You have a lot of other deductions that frankly, it's a joke. It's tremendous amounts of money and its money that they really don't need. They want it because they are used to paying no taxes. OK? We're very little taxes.
But how do you -- how do you get the money, then, to make up for the trillion of dollars in tax cuts.
Because --
The carried interests isn't going to do it.
Right. I agree with that. We're bringing in tremendous amounts of money into the country and we're going to create jobs. We're going to have an economy that is going to be robust. Right now, there's no one sent there for companies, there's just no, actually you're going to have the opposite. In my opinion, if it stays the way it is, you're going to have people, companies, big companies, and you know the ones that are talking about leaving, they are leaving the country, they're going to other countries to get their money, number one and probably maybe that isn't even number one, it's because they have a better tax rate outside of the United States.
Yes.
And you have major companies that want to leave our country and it used to be, they leave for Florida or Texas, they are leaving now and they are getting out of the United States.
And they are going to Ireland, they're going somewhere else.
Ireland is a prime suspect. I mean, Ireland is really doing a lot of business.
So Apple will pay more taxes?
Well, Apple is going to pay some taxes.
They are the biggest company with money overseas.
Right. Apple has tremendous money overseas and they are going to bring it back. And, you know, there's going to be a 10 percent tax on that money but at least that's reasonable. They are going to bring it back and then they will going to invest the money mostly here, in my opinion. They're going to -- mostly here. Now, they can invest it elsewhere but mostly here.
How will it be different than when George W. Bush did it. At that time, the estimate are 92 percent of the money that came home, went to shareholders, buybacks, thing like that. Didn't go to factories, new jobs --
First of all, we're going to create a great incentive for the money to be invested. But even if it does go to shareholders, the shareholders are going to spend the money. You're going to have people in this country, stock owners of the company, they are going to get x-dollars, they are going to go out and buy things and that's going to be good. The big surprise, in my opinion, is going to be how much money it is. Because as you know, estimates are from 2.1 to 2.5 and then some people said it could be much higher than that. And I got a nice surprise today. Carl Icahn endorsed me. You heard that, right?
I did. I saw that.
And that's a good endorsement.
He picked on you a few months ago and now he's coming around.
Right. He picked on me too much. I mean, he's a friend of mine. And he knows I know what I'm doing. I mean, look, Carl is no nonsense. One thing about Carl. There's no games. If he didn't think I was good and really good, he wouldn't have done that. But when you get Carl's endorsement in this world that we're talking about, that's a great endorsement. I also have Tom Brady's endorsement. That's a different kind of an endorsement.
You said you'd put ground troops on the ground in Iraq.
Well, we're going to have to do something with ISIS. I was totally against the war in Iraq and I was from the beginning, 2003, 2004 because you're going to destabilize the Middle East and I was right and should be given credit. Because that of everybody running, I'm the one person that said don't do it.
How do you put ground troops in Iraq though but not in Syria? Because there's no border, essentially, between those countries.
Let Syria and ISIS fight. Why do we care? Let ISIS and Syria fight. And let Russia, they're in Syria already, let them fight ISIS. Look, I don't want ISIS. ISIS is bad. They are evil. When they start doing with a head chopping and drowning of -- these are really bad dudes. So, I don't want to -- but let them fight it out. Let Russia take care of ISIS. How many places can we be?
So, when you talk about the Middle East, you know, you've been critical of the Iran nuclear deal. But unlike some, you even said, you threw it out, you've said you'd make it a better deal.
Well, I'm a person, I'm a business person. You just can't do that. But Erin, with that being said, and you've known some of the deals, I've bought into really bad contracts knowingly and I've bought in cheap because of that bad contracts. And I've taken those bad contracts and I've made them great. I've made a fortune. What you have to do is this. I will analyze that contract so strongly. I will go after and believe me, if they violate that contract, they have problems. But what they've done is they have totally out negotiated us. The fact that they get $150 billion, the fact that we have the 24-day wait period and it's actually much more than that.
Before we can inspect, yes.
No, it's crazy. I mean, 24 days before we can inspect? The fact that they self-inspect and how about the prisoners we don't get. We don't get anything. This is one of the thing that nobody talks about. If Israel ever attacks, if they ever attack Iran, there really is a clause in there, the way I read it and I'm pretty good at this stuff, we're supposed to protect Iran from Israel. I mean, we're supposed to fight Israel. It's not going to happen. We're supposed to fight, how do they allow a clause like that in there? So, it's a horrible deal. With that being said, I will police that to a level that they will not believe even exists.
So Hassan Rouhani just said something which about the GOP insulting pretty much all of you. He said, what the republican candidates are saying are laughable. He said, I'll quote him, some of them would not even know where Tehran was in relation to Iran. Some of them didn't know where Iran was geographically. That's pretty harsh.
Yes. I don't know who he's talking about --
So, you would know where Iran is on a map, right?
I do. I do. But let me just tell you what I said to him. They have so out negotiator, our people, because our people are babies. They have no idea what they are doing. I don't know why Obama wanted to make this deal so strongly because he lost on virtually every point. They will find out. I know he's not talking about me. They will find out that if I win, we're not babies. There's no more being babies anymore. One of the great problem --
So when people say the temperament questions, this is a guy who call someone a loser, he'll say something and they say that that's childish, but they say that that's childish. They say that's not the temperament of a president.
Probably it's a little childish. But you know what, this is a campaign. And usually and I think you know this better than anybody. I'm responding to them. I'm a counter-puncher. I think at every single instance I hit. For instance, Walker is very nice to me. All of a sudden, he hit me and I hit him back. All of these guys, Rubio is very nice to me. Could have been nicer. All of a sudden a week ago, he started hitting me, I hit him back.
So you're saying you're not going to talk about Vladimir Putin --
No.
-- calling him a loser or something like that?
I actually say the opposite. I think I would get along very well with him. We were both on 60 Minutes last night.
So you're going to keep your strategy --
-- a certain number of people and you have to get there first. I think Hillary in certain way is going to be easier than anybody else, but in most of the polls, I beat Hillary, and I just -- I view -- look, I have a certain number of people that I'm running against right now. One by one, they dropped out.
So when people say the temperament question, this is a guy who call someone a loser, he'll say something and they say that that's childish --
But this is a campaign.
Donald Trump joins us now on the phone. Mister Trump, good morning to you.
Good morning, Matt.
So you used words like amazing, simple, easy and fair in describing your tax plan. You've heard what the critics are saying. Not only will it add trillions to the national debt but it will also benefit the wealthy disproportionately. Why are they wrong?
Well, first of all, we actually have had tremendous reviews on the plan by most people, most people are liking it and are supporting it. And Carl Icahn came out today and so many others. They loved this plan. And it will actually affect the rich to a much lesser extent. The people that are middle income or middle class or middle income people are going to be the biggest beneficiaries. Their taxes are coming down very substantially. And for the most part, that's been covered. It hasn't been covered by you quite yet but I think it will be.
Let me ask you this. So -- so you're cutting the rates for millions of Americans, you're going to close some loopholes and get rid of some deductions although I think you still need to be more specific about that area. But the critics, again, I'm going with the critics, yes, there are positive reviews, but the critics say you're also shrinking the tax base, the number of people paying taxes, and that's why you can't pay for this.
Well, no, they're wrong because we're bringing in, at least two and a half trillion dollars is -- is stuck outside of this country. Two and a half trillion and the number could be much, much higher and companies can't get that money brought back into this country, just one of many things. And that money now will be able to flow back in under my plan. That money will be able to flow back into the country. We're going to be reducing corporate taxes. Jobs will be created. The economy is going to expand tremendously like it hasn't since Reagan but probably even before that. This will be a rocket ship for the economy. Right now, we have almost a hundred million people that are out of work. They're out of work, whether we like it or not. They're out of work. We need jobs.
We can debate -- we can debate jobs and growth at a later date. Let me ask you. You reveal -- you're revealing this plan at a time, Mister Trump, where it seems like the runaway train that was your campaign is slowing down a little bit. You're in a statistical dead heat now with Ben Carson and although they're a little bit further back, Carly Fiorina and Marco Rubio are definitely gaining traction. Why do you think there is this dynamic at this stage?
Well, Matt, I'm still leading in every poll. And some of the polls are really good. You know, you're citing one where I'm -- I'm leading actually, I'm one point up on Ben, but I am leading every poll. In Iowa, I'm leading substantially. In New Hampshire, I'm leading substantially. In South Carolina, I'm leading substantially. And, you know, this is going to be an ebb and flow. I'm not saying, you know, how can I continue to lead by such wide margins.
Right.
This is an ebb and flow, but I'm leading every single poll and most of them by a substantial number. Now, can I keep that going? I have no idea but I'll try. This is an important element because the economy is terrible. Our economy is right now terrible. And, you know, part of this is cutting, cost-cutting, because so much money is being wasted in the United States. So part of my plan is cost-cutting, and the other part of my plan is renegotiating trade deals to bring jobs back to the United States.
Let me ask you about this meeting between President Obama and President Putin yesterday. Obviously Russia went around the United States in creating this strategic alliance with Iraq, Iran and Syria to fight ISIS. I'm curious. Do you side with the group that thinks President Assad in Syria is the reason for the rise of ISIS or do you side with Vladimir Putin who thinks President Assad presents our best opportunity to combat ISIS?
Well, I side with the group that says if Russia wants to go and then fight ISIS, you should let them as opposed to saying, you know, we're jealous, we don't want you to do that. And I've been saying that for a long time. Now, Assad is backed up very strongly by Russia and by Iran. Iran wants ISIS out. Russia wants ISIS out. They want to destroy ISIS, and we should encourage them to do so. We don't have to do --
But let me just make sure I understand. Is Assad the problem or the solution?
Well, nobody really knows that answer. But I can tell you, the people that want to come in and replace Assad, nobody knows who they are and they could end up being worse. Nobody has any idea who they are. We don't know, and we're constantly going out and siding with people and they turn out to be worse than the people that were there before.
Let me just ask you. You hinted this a second ago. If this race turns into a long slog and all races do, and the polls change and you're no longer the person everybody is talking about, Donald, with all the great things going on in your life and other areas, do you have the stomach to stick this out?
Well, I'm a practical person, Matt. If I see things aren't going well, like, for instance, there are people right now within the Republican Party who are not doing well. I don't think it's going to change for many of them. At some point, you have to get out. Right now, I'm leading every poll, I'm doing very well, I get the biggest crowds by far. I had twenty thousand people in Dallas. I have thirty-five thousand people in Mobile, Alabama.
Right.
I mean, you know, so far, it's looking good. I'm self-funding my campaign. That's the nice thing. So -- and a lot of people respect that so I'm not under the influence of the lobbyists and special interests --
Right.
-- and people like that. So I will go and if I think for some reason it's not going to work, then I go back to my business. There's no question about that. But right now I think it's working very, very well.
Donald Trump. Donald, thanks so much for your time this morning. I appreciate it.
Thank you very much, Matt.
Ok. But I mean look, the media is not going to give you a fair shake and they are just not. That brings us to me --
That's true.
Ok. And I didn't mind the Gang of Eight stuff.
Rand Paul was so nice.
I didn't mind the Gang of Eight stuff. It's calling him a "clown" that's not presidential.
He was a member of the Gang of Eight.
All right. Final question.
Ok, listen. Excuse me -- Bill.
Go ahead.
He was a member of the Gang of Eight which was a disaster. He was totally weak on immigration.
But that's fine.
And by the way he hasn't changed.
But it's the clown stuff that's not fine. Last question.
Well, ok. I can understand that.
Ok, good.
But he hit me very viciously.
Remember Howard?
It's a combination.
You are going to grow on everybody? You are going to grow on us then? You're going to grow on us.
Well, when I go to Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina they really like me and my favorables are great there because they see me a lot.
Everything fair? Are we good?
You were very fair. You are always fair.
Yes, yes, yes.
Almost.
So, you come in, the first thing you do you hand me these polls.
Just got them myself.
And they're good, though.
Very nice. Yes, they are.
Can we talk about the Suffolk University poll, a brand new poll?
Sure.
I want to talk more about the polls and get to the race a little bit later.
OK.
But I've got to get to foreign policy now with what's going on with Syria and Russia. Because the big international is Russia, you know, striking Syria for the first time, now giving the U.S. about an hour's notice.
Sure. They don't respect the U.S.
There are -- listen, where you have, you've got Russia and the U.S. but flying in the same place.
Right.
Right.
Still, nobody's mentioning the fourth. Who is the fourth that they're not mentioning?
Right.
They said, Trump is totally unpredictable. And I want to be unpredictable. So, when you say what would you do, you know, I said I'd take the oil. OK. You know that. And a lot of people, stupid people said, oh, what a terrible thing. Well, now who has the oil? ISIS is having -- ISIS has so much oil. They are paying people to be their soul. They got money and it's because largely of the oil. I said, take the oil. And I was against going into Iraq in the first place.
I know you said it.
No, no, it's very important because it's called vision. I said you're going to destabilize the Middle East and Iran is going to take over Iraq if you do this. And that's exactly happened. And by the way, an offshoot, ISIS also happened because of that.
That's all well and good. And I appreciate you saying that...
Well, I know, but I was the one who predicted it. And I was the one that said it, nobody else said it.
Are you...
And I think it's very important for people to know, a lot of the voter, I may be leading in the polls by a lot.
I've been saying it but some people say that you should -- you may have the nomination, you should act like you have the job. You told our very own Erin Burnett that, you know, sometimes, yes, you acquiesce, it's a little bit childish, you know, maybe I should be more presidential.
Well, I'm fighting a lot of people. No, but, Don, I'm fighting a lot of people that are coming at me because I have good polls and they -- look, you have governors and senators that are at one.
Yes.
So, when you see that, and I understand why, I think I'd do the same thing they're doing, but all of a sudden they hit me. I mean, I get hit out of the blue by Rand Paul.
Yes.
Two weeks ago, I get hit by this guy Rubio. They hit me because they want to grab some of the attention.
But you don't think that's being disingenuous?
Why would I not compliment her?
Yes.
I've dealt all my life. I've dealt at high levels of politics.
Yes.
And some of your people on your staff can tell you that that are in this room right now, and I've done very well.
And you have done very well. And speaking of, Forbes they came out with richest 400 richest wealthiest people, you are at 121. You have said your net $10 billion and upwards. They have said $4.5 billion. Who's right?
That's so wrong, it's ridiculous. But that doesn't matter. Because as the expression, when you say what's the different between 5 billion and 10 billion, probably for the most part, nothing.
Five billion.
And they say I have very low data, I have tremendous cash flow, I have a wonderful company, I have the most iconic assets. They're totally off. They know they're off. They told me, they way off.
I wondered when you came out with your tax plan, if the tax plan that you had and to be quite honest, it was actually good for Americans who tend to be on the lower end, which can be black and brown people, right, who are in the lower end because they won't have to pay taxes, right?
It is good. And it is going to create jobs.
Hey, let me get the question in. Let me get the question.
Go ahead.
Let's talk about some things personally. You're here but you say that I'm fair to you, right?
I think you have been generally fair. You've been unfair but so has everybody else.
But someone say you're defending the truth, but you're not defending the President.
He was -- well, remember this, you're not saying I defend it. I didn't respond, OK.
Have they asked you about your comments?
But you certainly have, and by the way, they think we have a bigger problem than we do. OK. They think we have a bigger problem. Because there's a radical Islamic group of people that is brutal. And unless our country gets tough and smart, and unless we have the right leadership, Don, we're in big trouble.
No, I'm saying it's not.
Far right does like me. But you know what likes me?
I'm saying your appeal is broader than people...
Democrats likes me, liberals like -- it's across the board.
Yes, that's what I'm saying your appeal is broader than people think it is.
Yes. People are very surprised by that.
OK.
But what does happen and what people are surprised at is in every one of my polls, not just today's wonderful poll from USA Today, but every single one of the polls, people, like you, I think you're one of them, it's straight across the board.
Yes.
I get support from everybody.
And you have said that you're not anti-Muslim. So, thank you for answering those questions. That I think it's important to clear things up.
OK, fine. Fine.
Let's talk about Planned Parenthood.
OK.
But what our reporting shows...
And you know what, they had bad representatives. Because when you watch some of those doctors talking so cavalierly about what obviously is human life, I think it's disgraceful.
Ok. But Carly Fiorina has made this a big point of her campaign talking about the video, right? The Planned Parenthood video.
But that was a different video, though, that's a different, you know, there were some video that was -- if that was really a video I guess what they say was not a correct video.
Right. It's not right.
But there were plenty of -- I don't know anything about that.
What are your thoughts on that?
I mean, she's been hit very hard on that because they say it wasn't correct. I don't know. I mean, I can't say, I can't speak to that video. But I've seen some of the other videos that are absolutely correct and I think it's disgraceful what they're doing.
Can we talk about your family?
Yes.
I just met your son Donald Jr.
Good.
I have said before that you don't see the Trump kids, you know, in and out of clubs or in the tabloids or you have done -- What does that say about you how you, the kids you have raised and who they are?
Well, I have children. Everybody has wonderful children. We all love our children.
Yes.
Because your children have been good. Now, knock on wood, I hope it continues that way. You know, life is fragile. I think it continues that way.
I think you're past the point where it goes bad.
Well, I past to certain point. But I do have good children.
So, let's talk about Melania, right, your wife.
OK.
What kind of first lady do you think Melania would be?
I think she will be incredible. I think she will -- she's got a tremendous heart, I think she will incredible.
She said, listen, my job right now, and I'm on a campaign trail is because, you know, my husband is going a lot. He's out campaigning and I need to be at home with Barron because Barron needs. What does Barron think of all of this?
Well, Barron loves New York, and he keeps saying, "Dad, do you think we'll have to go to Washington?" I said, it's got a long way to go right now. But he loves his school and he loves New York, he's got a lot of friends. So, right now, I think he would be very happy to stay in New York. But he asked me, "do you think we have to go?" And I always tell him, we have a long way to go.
Donald Trump, thank you very much.
Thank you, Don.
I appreciate it. Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Joining us by phone, republican presidential candidate and the frontrunner, Donald Trump. Donald, good to have you on the show this morning.
Good morning.
Donald Trump, your reaction. Is there a concern that perhaps you're tapping into negative forces in this country?
No. I mean, she used to call me a genius. I've come a long way down, I guess. She was always very nice and everything but I guess it's a different world today. She's got problems and I would always be nice because I was a businessman, a very successful person and I was nice to everybody regardless. That was my job to be nice to everybody. I didn't want to insult people. Now I'm in a different position and we have to tell the facts the way the facts are. So I'm a little surprised at her tone, but that's OK. But she's been surprised at my tone also.
She says you are stoking prejudice and hatred. What do you say to that?
Well, I disagree 100 percent. I mean, I've watch your people from the failing "National Review " who are -- you know, I mean, they -- And actually, Joe, as you know, the poll numbers are way up as opposed to way down -- But you know, they write up these stories without calling. There's a lot of animosity on both sides. It's an amazing thing. The level of animosity is incredible actually and it would be nice if the Republican Party, as an example, because that's what we're thinking about right now, if they could all come together and we could be friendlier. Remember, I'm only a counter -- You know, I'm a counterpuncher and everything I say is when somebody says something about me and it's sort of interesting. Hillary now is going at it too. So you know, you have to take it as it is.
And as it is, we were just showing the national polling numbers. You're at 23 percent with a 10-point lead over Ben Carson. In New Hampshire the CNN/WMUR poll shows you're at 26 percent with a 10-point lead. In Iowa the Quinnipiac poll, the most resent shows that you're at 27 percent with a six-point lead over Ben Carson.
And leading big with the Evangelicals. Very big.
Hey Donald, it's Willie. Good to talk to you this morning.
Hello, Willie.
So Donald, is it fair to say then that your opinion is some people are going to slip through the cracks and there's not much you can do about it?
Well, you know, it's not politically correct to say that but you're going to have difficulty and that would be for the next millions years you're going to have difficulty. People are going to slip through the cracks and even if you did great mental health programs, people are going to slip through the cracks. I'm sure it's going to be found that this guy was probably you know, they seem to be loaners. They have all sorts of difficulties, they call people and nobody wants to go out with them. It's the same old story. But what are you going to do -- There are many people like that and what are you going to do? Institutionalize everybody? So you're going to have difficulties. You're going to have difficulties with many different things, not just this. That's the way the world works -- and by the way, that's the way the world always has worked, Willie.
Mr. Trump.
Hi, Mark.
Does Kevin McCarthy -- Hi, how are you? Does Kevin McCarthy have good political instincts and should your party make him Speaker of the House?
Well, you know, I don't know him, but certainly he's not off to a great start. I watched that actually and I was a little surprised by it. It can be actually taken both ways. It's really what he said could be very much taken both ways. He's got his view and other people, obviously the Democrats are running and Hillary, in particular is running with it, but it would have been nice if he didn't say it, certainly, because then there would be no dispute and you get on with Benghazi as a very serious group of people that have been working on it for a long time.
Should he be Speaker of the House?
I would like to see somebody that's very tough and that can negotiate with the Democrats and I don't know that he's that person. Somebody that -- we need somebody that's a very, very tough, smart cunning person. I don't know that that's him and obviously, this statement hurt him pretty badly in the eyes of some.
Um --
Unfortunately.
Let's talk about your race. Ben Carson brought in over $20 million in the third quarter. The average donation was $51 and he brought that in. Just in the third quarter. And he's, he seems to be picking up a good bit of momentum. Is Ben Carson your biggest challenge right now to getting the Republican nomination?
I don't know. He's a nice man. I know him and I like him and we have a good relationship, so far, I mean, I'm sure at some point he'll hit me. You know, it's one of those things. But so far, we've had a very good relationship and I like him.
Is he qualified to be President of the United States? Do you think he's one of those tough negotiators that you talked about?
Well, he's running and -- Yeah, he's running and if he wins, he's qualified because that's the way the system works. So you know, he's running. Will anybody be able to do the job that I'm going to do? Absolutely not. But he's running so therefore, he's qualified.
Would you hire him in your administration?
I would. Yes. I would. Absolutely. I would love to have that. Absolutely.
You think he's a tough negotiator?
That I don't know. I would say it's not his wheelhouse. But that I don't know. But in certain elements of an administration, I think he would be very good. I mean, you know, it's been --
What would you hire him for?
It's been interesting because the polling has been amazing for me and it's been really good for him and you add a couple of these numbers together and in some cases you're up to 55-60 percent of the seminonpoliticians or the people that are sort of -- they want to make change, right. Real change, not Obama change. And it's amazing when you look at some of the numbers, actually.
Thank you, Donald.
Well thank you very much. Great honor.
You mentioned...
It should never have gotten this way.
Yes, that was on my list.
And obviously, we've got a horrible ruling -- well, we got a horrible two rulings by Justice Roberts...
Ted Cruz was the only one!
... which is a shame.
Ted Cruz stood alone...
He did. He did.
... to fulfill the promise that every other one of them made, and he became a pariah. That -- that -- that speaks volumes about...
He did.
Yes.
So we'll have to see, but I don't think the prosecutors are going to prosecute.
All right, last question. You laid out your plan. I thought it was a very conservative plan. I think bringing back the trillions of dollars in repatriation that countries have parked offshore because they don't want to get taxed -- that's a good part of it.
Right.
Lowering the corporate rate I think makes America a tax safe haven. Telling couples that make $50,000 a year, You win. That's the -- that's the tax return you fill out.
Right.
You mean million-dollar...
And I don't even have that part in my plan.
... soccer fields for -- million-dollar soccer fields for terrorists. I'm, like, We are dumb!
You have waste that's beyond. Beyond. So we've got a great plan. It's been really well received by a lot of people. And we're very proud of it. It's going to create jobs and it's going to create a great economy and it's going to lower taxes. So...
Unsolicited...
... I'm very happy with it.
Unsolicited information. I like the plan. I would add energy independence to it because I think that would add a lot of jobs to the economy, too.
We will have energy independence. I guarantee you that.
You think he was being a divider?
I think he was. I think he was actually being a divider because, you know, George, no matter how you cut it, you have people that are mentally ill and they have problems and they're going to slip through the cracks. And no matter how you do it, no matter how you try, and if you go back 2,000 years and if you go forward 2 million years, you're going to have problems. And it may not even be politically correct to say --
Yeah, but every country has mentally ill people, not every country has mass shootings as frequently as we do.
But what's interesting is the places, you look at Chicago, it's got the toughest gun laws in the United States, you look at other places where they have gun laws that are very tough, they do generally speaking worse than anybody else. I mean if you look at some of these places, Chicago's a good example, but go to Baltimore, go to various cities where they have very, very tough gun laws, they do terribly.
So what would you do about it? You sound pretty passive.
No, I don't. I'm not passive at all. I can tell you that people say, oh, were going to stop it. It doesn't work that way. This has taken place whether it's this type of crime or other crimes, taken a place forever, from the beginning, and it's going -- you go out a million years from now, you're going to have problems. And even if you have a very tough system, you're going to have people that slip through the cracks. And it's a very sad situation and you have to -- great vigilance. I mean you have to show great vigilance and watch and be careful and security and everything else. But no matter what you do, you will have problems and that's the way the world goes. You can have --
That's your answer, were going to have problems --
Yes, you're going to -- now, George, I could say, oh, were going to do this and that and it's never going to happen again. You have sick people in this country and throughout the world and you're always going to have difficulty. That's why you have newscasts.
But you're Mr. Fix-it. You're Mr. Can-Do.
I know that. I know that. And I think I'll do a fabulous job. And I will make things a lot better. No matter what you do, you're going to have difficulties. People are going to slip through the cracks.
So no new laws, no new gun laws?
Well, the gun laws have nothing to do with this. This isn't guns. This is about really mental illness. And I feel very strongly about it. And, again, politically correct, oh, we're going to solve the problem, there will be no problem, etcetera, etcetera. You're always going to have difficulties, no matter how tight you run it. Even if you had great education having to do with mental illness, you educate the community, it's -- still, you're going to have people that slip through the cracks. And these people are more than slipping through the cracks. These people want to slip through the cracks. So you're going to have problems. It's unfortunate.
Let's talk about your tax plan.
Yes.
Everyone gets a tax cut.
Right.
More and more Americans will pay nothing at all. But the Conservative Tax Foundation says it will increase the deficit by about $10 trillion over 10 years.
What do they know? George, what do they know? I mean they've been doing this stuff for years.
They run the numbers.
Can I tell you what? They've been doing this stuff for years. They're so off. You look at their past projections, they are so far off. People -- this is a very dynamic plan.
So it's not going to increase the deficit?
People are going -- well, if it works the way I want it to work it's not because we're going to bring back jobs. I am going to bring back so many jobs. One of the things that we're coming out with in the next three or four weeks is cutting. And the cutting is a big part of my plan.
So you're going to come up with cuts that will close that hole?
We're going to come up with very substantial cuts and --
Give me one.
The Department of Education. We're going to do cutting. And the economy is going to grow exponentially.
You also said that this tax plan is going to cost you a fortune.
It will cost me a lot of money.
How do you get there?
Well, I'll tell you what. I have carried interest, like a lot of other people do, and carried interest is a wonderful thing, but it's unfair --
But -- but -- but -- but that's --
And rich people are getting --
That's $20 billion over 10 years for everyone who has it. That's a small --
But it's psychologically so important. If the economy grows, we all make it up. I mean, frankly, the job producers make it up.
Let's --
The economy has to grow.
According to your financial disclosure you made, what, about $250 million in the last year?
605 million.
OK, 605. The top rate goes from 40 percent to about 25 percent.
Right.
Capital gains comes down from 23 to 20.
Right.
That's a huge -- that's tens of millions of savings for you.
Everybody's going to save, according to my plan, and that money -- you know where that money's going?
That means you're not going to be spending -- you're not going to be paying more taxes though.
That money is going back into other things.
But you're going to get a tax cut?
I don't know because I have very big deductions that are frankly some of them are ridiculous. You're entitled to deductions. So I don't know that I am. I think --
But not 605 million dollars ' worth.
I think that probably I'll end up paying more under this. To be honest, I don't think I'm going to. If you look at all of the kinds of deductions that people are allowed to take, that you're not going to be taking anymore, including carried interest, that's just one of them, I think I probably don't do as well.
But where your family would make potentially hundreds of millions of dollars, eliminating the estate tax.
Well, the estate tax is a different thing. The estate tax is a very, very horrible weapon that has destroyed many families. In particular, farms and things where they make an income and they have a certain value and they have to go out and borrow money and they put mortgages on their farms, they --
Twenty farms in the last year.
It's a big business. George, if you have a business, and let's say it's a business that's not very liquid, and people have to go out and borrow against the business, you are having travesty. And the other thing is, it's a double taxation. The tax has already been paid. I mean you've been hearing this argument for many years.
So your family would benefit but you're saying it's just wrong.
No, no, I say it's a double taxation. It's a -- it's -- the death tax is an unfair tax because the tax has already been paid.
Bottom line, you do accept that you are going to make out well under your tax plan?
I don't know. I mean if the economy is good, if the economy is great, everybody makes out well so.
Getting any closer to releasing your tax returns?
Well, I'm thinking about it. I'm thinking about maybe when we find out the true story on Hillary's emails -- you know, I've been saying that for a while, let's find out the true stories...
Let's talk about what...
But I just want to say, I fight like hell to pay as little as possible. I used to watch Romney -- who, by the way, really let us down because he failed to win an election that he should have won easily. I used to watch him try and get his number as high as possible. It's not the way it works. I mean I fight because that's a very big expense. And one of the problems and one of the reasons I fight so hard is because I hate the way our country is spending my money and everybody else's money.
You think he's falling into a trap?
Well, I think it's a -- I think it's not going to be great for them, if you want to know the truth. But let's just -- look, they got bogged down. It destroyed the Soviet Union. I mean they essentially went bankrupt. They -- it destroyed the Soviet Union, Afghanistan. Now they're going into Syria. There are so many traps. There are so many problems. When I heard they were going in to fight ISIS, I said, "Great.
Finally, you talked about the polls. A lot of good polls. You're still in the lead. Ratings breaking records every time you go on television. And this let Dan Hettinger, a "Wall Street Journal " columnist yesterday, who says you're a master of timing. He said it in Atlantic City and says, this is as good as it gets for you. Quote, "Mr. Trump should retire the sky box and enjoy what he has wrought."
Well I've had a lot of fun doing this and I guess it's more fun when you see the kind of polls that I'm getting. And I think they're now higher than ever. And a lot of that is dissent. I mean people are very, very unhappy with what's happened with politicians, how badly they're running the country. They're all talk no action. I've dealt with them all my life, believe me. You know that because you've covered me in my previous life.
What's your explanation?
They're just sick people. They are mentally imbalanced and they probably see it happening here more so.
Do you think we have more mentally ill people than other countries?
I think what we have is I think we have copycats, I think they watch it and they see it here maybe more than other places and the world can be a pretty sick place in so many different ways but we have mentally very unstable people and that is going to lead. And you know, it's not politically correct to say, you can have the best security, you can have the best everything but people are able to get in and do this -- you know, just terrible damage.
This is a startling statistics. 153,000 people have died from gunshots since 9/11. And counting 9/11, up to -- just over 3,000 people have died from terrorist attacks. We have -- the President's point is we have devoted all these energies to prevent terrorism. Should there be a sense of urgency on this?
So the way I look at it, you take Chicago, you take Baltimore, you take various other places where you have tremendous gun violence and death, right? The strictest laws in the United States, in the world for guns happens to be Chicago where they have a lot of problems. Baltimore, a lot of the places where you have the biggest problem is where they have the strongest laws.
But local laws without a national floor are pointless.
But the problem you have is the strongest, the most stringent laws are in almost every case the worst places. It doesn't seem to work. It's a tough situation, Chuck. It's a tough situation and when it comes to the schools it really health's mental health. It's a mental problem.
You don't believe this is a -- we have too many guns? Do you think there's too many guns in America?
Well, you know, you could make the case that the school that we just went through and I see was a gun-free zone and you were not allowed to have guns at fall that particular area. And you can make the case that it would have been a lot better had people had guns because they had something to fire back.
You say you can make the case. Do you make the case?
Well, I would say that it couldn't be much worse. I think the police did a great job, they got there quickly and they were able to kill him but you can -- I can make the case that if there were guns in that room other than his fewer people would have died. Fewer people would have been so horribly injured.
We just had 4 percent last quarter.
Well, we can do it. We also had zero percent the first quarter.
I understand, but we just had 4 percent the last quarter.
A little less than 4 percent.
3.9 percent.
It was what?
Our sweet spot is 3 percent to 5 percent.
Right. If we do 6 percent or 7 percent under my plan everybody benefits --
We've never had a year of 6 percent or 7 percent.
But we can do that.
What you're saying is you make it up with growth?
No, not all up with growth. We also start cutting because the waste in this country is unbelievable. When you look at all of the --
You're going to get rid of entire departments?
I would get rid of some. You know, as an example, "Department of Education".
You'd get rid of it?
Not entirely. But I'd certainly get rid of a lot of it. If you look at Jeb Bush, he's a big common core person. I'm not. I want local education. We could say a fortune with environmental protection.
Do you believe you can spend less money on defense than we do today?
I think we can make our defense much stronger, spend somewhat less money and increase --
So you cut the defense budget and make the military stronger?
Chuck, when they send an 18-cent washer from South Carolina to Texas and it costs almost a million dollars to bring it there because of the fraud and abuse and everything else. I mean it was a fraud but there have been many cases like that, we can save so much. When a hammer that you buy at Home Depot for $8 costs $900 --
Do you know how many politicians have said this over the years?
I know, but I'm not a politician.
Waste, fraud and abuse. It never happened.
I'm not a politician, I'm a business guy. I mean, of course, for the last three months I'm a politician.
It never happens.
You watch it happen with me.
Let's move to Syria.
Ok.
Do you think the Middle East would be better today if Gadhafi, Saddam and Assad were sort of -- if Saddam and Gadhafi were still there and Assad were stronger? Do you think the Middle East would be safer?
It's not even a contest. It's not even a contest. Iraq is a disaster.
So it would be better off if Saddam were in charge.
Don't forget, ISIS came out of Iraq.
Do you welcome Putin's involvement?
I like that Putin is bombing the hell out of ISIS. And it's going to be ISIS. And I'll tell you why? Putin has to get rid of ISIS because Putin doesn't want ISIS coming into Russia.
So you would pull out of what we're doing in Syria right now?
This is not usually me talking because I'm very proactive as you probably know.
You're leading in every poll.
Everything -- by a lot.
In the Republican primaries.
Not only leading by a lot.
Hundred and nineteen days on the trail so far. What have you learned about the American public?
That they are really, really smart. They get it. They don't believe what they read, you know, because they read so many false stories. And I'm not only talking about myself, I'm talking about just generally. The American public gets it.
Would you do anything differently?
I mean, I can't really say I would. Certainly, I guess, if you think back, sure, I wouldn't do this or that. But --
Which would -- like what?
Well, I don't want to get into the negativity. I mean, I could probably have said fewer things about certain things. But -- but honestly, I'm very happy with the way it's going. I mean, you look, I'm reading in every poll --
That's the first time I've ever heard you say that though that you might do something differently.
Well, I might. But I never look back; I like to look forward. I like to learn from the past and I have learned. I mean, I learned from --
So what have you learned for the next hundred eighteen days?
I think I could be perhaps a little bit -- I can watch my words a little bit, maybe be a little bit more politically correct. But to be honest with you, I think one of the reasons I am doing well is because I don't want to -- being politically correct takes a lot of time. We don't have time to always be politically correct. And I can be more politically correct than anybody that you've ever interviewed but it takes a lot of time to do it.
Bernie had a moment last night when he defended Hillary Clinton. He came off as magnanimous. Could you see yourself ever being that way to one of your competitors?
Yes, I could. And I could be very magnanimous if I have to be. But Bernie made a mistake: he got a great couple of seconds, but he took a situation that's a very serious situation where Hillary is being investigated by the FBI and he gave it away. He just gave it away. He can never bring it up again. And it's not like he is winning, he is losing. He is losing actually big, if you look countrywide. So I think he made a mistake.
Trump praised the Republican-led Benghazi committee for investigating Secretary Clinton but added for him the controversy is not top of mind. She thinks the Republicans are pushing Benghazi. Do you find that to be the case? Do you think we've done enough with this and then we should move on as a country?
Yell, I guess, they are going to go through a hearing. We're going to see. I would say this. It's not the biggest thing in terms of my own thought process. I think they are doing the right thing. Benghazi is one of many, many things. I mean, Hillary had a very bad record as Secretary of State. She had tremendous mistakes she's made. Look, I mean, just look at the whole world just blowing up around us. Hillary has had such a bad time as Secretary of State that I really think that she is going to be rather easy to beat.
Did he have a chance to see "Saturday Night Live" this past weekend? They had Secretary Clinton was a character that she actually went and acted, and then they had a skit about you. Were you treat fairly by NBC?
Right. Well, I think so. I mean, it was cute. It was fun. It was nice. It's a good show. I mean, I have been on. I have hosted it and, you know, it is what it is. I think it was fair and it was funny. It's supposed to be funny. It was supposed to be a little bit of laughs and it was. And they certainly had a lot of me in that show, that I can tell you.
Why would --
We need victory and we don't have victory anymore.
Why was President Obama seemingly surprised about Vladimir Putin sending his general into the embassy in Baghdad, I think it was on Wednesday, to say that they are going to start flying planes -- Russian planes in Syria in an hour. How did that surprise happened in your mind?
Well, that's a perfect case in point. I mean, Putin was here. He was in this country. And he was -- everything was like fine. They meet. And in theory, there should be no surprises. And a couple of days later, they leave and they send somebody in, a general or somebody to say this is what we are going to be doing.
Donald, thank you very much for joining us.
Thank you very much, Greta.
Let's bring in Republican candidate Donald J. Trump to get his take on the situation. Mr. Trump, can you hear me?
I can, Chris. Good morning.
But is wait and see good leadership here? Because you would effectively be subcontracting out the war against ISIS to Russia? Is that a situation --
And saving tens of billions of dollars and letting them go after ISIS, because, you know, they want ISIS also. They want to knock out ISIS because they don't want them coming into Russia. They have a bigger stake, in a sense, than we do, other than if we take 200,000 people that we have no idea who they are, which is the next move we're going to make with our brilliant leaders, our brilliant politicians.
Well, maybe, maybe not. But you've got to move forward, not backwards.
Not maybe, I don't think it's maybe not. There's no doubt. If Saddam Hussein were around, if we didn't destroy that -- knock the hell out of them so that they're no longer -- they're nothing. They used to hold Iran in check. They'd have wars forever. They go back and forth, ten feet left, ten feet right.
There is a history.
They'd go back and forth, nothing would happen.
But you don't know what would have happened is what I'm saying.
So, Chris, I'm just saying sit back, just take it easy, just relax, save your billions of dollars. Let's build some bridges, let's fix roadways in our country. Let's rebuild America. Make America great again. Let's rebuild our military, where, by the way, every time we give weapons and humvees and everything to our so-called allies over there, one bullet gets shot up in the air, we give all of this equipment, and ISIS ends up picking it up. And others that are fighting.
So you're saying you have to leave troops?
Chris, we shouldn't have gone into Iraq. And then we shouldn't have taken our remaining soldiers out, OK? But, look, eventually it was going to collapse. We're in the middle of civil wars. We're in the middle of tribal strife. There's so many different things going on there, we have no idea. So we're backing these people in Syria. We have no idea who they are. We have no idea. We're going to give them billions of dollars to fight Assad. And they might very well, Chris, be worse than Assad. We don't know that. They might very well be worse than Assad.
So I hear you on that point. And on Afghanistan you're saying that you're with the president, for now you leave the troops there and see what the time horizon is.
I would leave the troops there, begrudgingly. I'm not happy about it, I will tell you, but I would leave the troops there begrudgingly, yes.
Well, that's the easiest part to control is, how much attention you give the shooters. That's certainly something --
Well, you try to give as little attention as possible. And the sheriff was right not mentioning his name. And you try and give as little attention as possible. But it is a real problem and it's a major mental health problem we have and other places have. You know, it's interesting, in Chicago, in various other places where they have the toughest gun laws anywhere in the world, they have shootings at a level that nobody has even been able to fathom. So high.
They're less likely to be violent than be violent.
But as good as you fill it in --
How do you fill in the cracks?
No matter how well you fill them in, at some point, some wacky, crazy guy with a high IQ but who's totally nuts is going to get through that crack. I mean, it's going to happen. And it's happened in different forms. I mean, not just this kind of thing but crazy things have happened from the beginning, from the beginning. And you go thousands of years into the future, no matter how good people -- things will happen.
Right, but don't you think we can get better?
And it's really -- can I tell you what? It's -- you can absolutely make it better and you can fill in the cracks.
How?
But every once in a while, somebody will get through.
But what do you do? Do you start interviewing people before they get a gun? The way other places do? Do you talk to them, do you call their family, do you see if they're stable? Would you put that type of onus on the process of getting a weapon?
Well, we have right now, in 1998, a lot of legislation was passed. And we have good legislation but unfortunately it's not really working because a lot of people are not utilizing it, including the federal government. I mean, the federal government has done a hell of a bad job of policing it. But we do have existing legislation which should be very effective and it's not. You know that. I mean --
Why is it not?
-- they report all the time. It hasn't been effective because the government is not doing a good job in policing it.
Well, you also have some of those loophole problems, right? You have background checks but you don't have them on person-to-person sales in every place. States have to do it for themselves like they did in New York. You have the gun show loophole that Hillary Clinton is coming out against that tries to blunt that in some online sales. These are things that are being fought back against. Are you in favor of closing the loopholes?
That's right. You know, Chris, the one thing I say that I think is very important, though, is I'm a very big Second Amendment person. And if you had somebody in that room or a couple of people in that room who were on the side of good, not evil, and they had guns, you would have stopped the kind of damage that took place. And the cops did a great job, the police did a fantastic job, because they got there so quickly. Amazing. But you still had lives lost and people badly, badly, really badly hurt. But the police did a fantastic job. But if people would have been in that room, and if they would have had a gun, you would have had a tremendous different -- a tremendous -- if they knew how to use it, you would have had a whole different outcome.
It's a big if. It's a big if. When you look at the statistics.
Well, it's not a big if; it's simple.
Well it is a big if because you don't know what happens.
If somebody was in that room that knew how to use a gun, you know, was trained, and by the way, most of the gun holders that do it legally, most of the gun holders really know how to use them. But if somebody were in that room that had experience with a gun, they would have been able to fight back. They would have shot him maybe before he --
Maybe.
-- before he hurt and killed so many people.
Maybe. Maybe they would have shot somebody else. You know, when you look at the research on this, having a weapon when confronted by someone with a weapon can go either way. But the point that comes --
But, Chris, he's in the room.
I understand the hypothetical.
There are people that had absolutely no weapon. I mean, they're just sitting there with their hands up, he had them lined up, stand up, and then he shoots them.
I understand; it's a terrible situation.
Especially if they said they were Christians. I mean, he would shoot them in the head. And these people are standing there just waiting to be slaughtered.
You would rather have a chance to fight back. Absolutely.
If they had a gun in the room, if somebody in the room had a gun, at least they would have a fighting chance.
You would rather have a chance to fight back; there's no question. So that leads to the next question. Are you in favor of more guns? Get rid of gun-free schools, have gun-full schools? Have armed security in schools. Is that what you think the answer is?
Well, this was a gun-free school. I mean, this was a gun-free area they call it. And, frankly, that wasn't working so well. And that hasn't worked. How about military bases? How about the five soldiers that were killed? And they were actually heroes, they were actually experts at -- you know, expert -- a couple of them were expert marksmen, highly decorated soldiers.
So do you change those rules?
They were at a gun-free area; they had a gun-free zone in a base. I mean they were in a base, a military base.
So do you change those rules?
And this guy walks in and shot these five incredible -- actually it turns out to be six probably -- but these five or six really great, highly decorated soldiers. They were sitting there and they couldn't do a damn thing about it.
So do you change those rules?
Now, for a military base to have a gun-free zone, and we've had a couple instances where that took place, Chris, it's ridiculous. If they would have had a gun, this guy wouldn't have had a chance. Especially with these guys. He wouldn't have a chance. Instead, they're all dead.
And that you're open to the idea --
Look, I mean these people would be alive. They probably wouldn't have gotten any of them.
I understand your point.
They would have been alive. They're sitting there, they had no chance. These are highly decorated military people. These were not just regular people. These were highly decorated, very talented and skilled with weapons.
I understand your point on that. The schools are a little bit more of a complicated situation. But there, too, you're saying guns may have made a difference. That's something you'd think about in terms of allowing access. That's going to be a big part of the debate.
Well, you know, when the two prisoners escaped in New York that your brother knew well about, and was -- I mean, that was not an easy task for him when they got out, a number of people up in upstate New York are seeing one instance where a husband and wife, he was a very big Second Amendment person, want a gun. She was totally against it. When those prisoners got out, and it took them -- I think law enforcement did a great job in getting them, frankly -- but when they -- they were free for a while. And all of a sudden she became now the biggest advocate because they were sitting in their house in that same very close little area, they were sitting there and they had the protection of having the gun --
Of course the fear --
And all of a sudden she became a big proponent of the Second Amendment because they needed protection.
So you're open to the assault weapons, too.
But the bad guys, the bad guys, you think they're going to say, oh gee, the law says I'm going to only put seven bullets in a magazine?
Well, just because people are going to break a law doesn't mean that you don't have a law. But you're saying that you're OK with assault weapons as well?
Well, you have to be because the bad guys are going to have them anyway. And the answer is yes. And, you know, a lot of that stuff is used for recreational purposes. They use it for recreational purposes. But you're not going to have problems with people that are law-abiding people. But what happens when the bad guys have the assault weapons and you don't? And there's a confrontation?
That's certainly what feeds the desire to have more guns in society. You have got your finger right on that.
Well, it's one of those things.
Let me ask you about --
But you have to believe in the Second Amendment. I mean, there's no choice.
Well, you can believe in it --
And remember the school. If somebody in that room had a gun, you would not have had -- if they knew how to use it, which I assume the answer to that would be yes.
That is not as easy an answer as you make it sound.
The people we're talking about do know how to use them. If somebody were in that room, or somebody was on that military base, in that room in the military bus, that had a gun, you would not have had the catastrophic results you had.
Right, I understand where your take is on them. But, you know, because there's contraction --
No, no, I'm not getting out. I'm not going anywhere, Chris. I'm leading every poll. I'm leading every state. I'm not going anywhere, OK?
Good to hear.
Let me answer it differently. I gave an honest answer. I said, look, if for some reason I had no chance and I collapse and they take that as an, oh, maybe there's a little weakness in Trump in terms of the answer. There's no weakness. I'm not going anywhere. I'm leading every poll. I'm going to win and I'm going to make our country great again. That's what I'm all -- I'm not in this to have self-glorification. I've had plenty of that. I don't need that. I'm in it to make our country great again. And right now I'm leading, I'm winning, I'm winning by big numbers.
Right, but there is contraction.
In some cases by really big numbers.
There is contraction though. I'm not talking about you getting out; that was one question. The next question is --
Well, depends on what poll you look at it. If you look at some of the polls that came out two, three days ago, the NBC poll --
Put up some of the polls.
-- was 29, the OAN poll I was at 35. That came out two days ago. I was at 35.
There's contraction in math. It's math. It's not my mind. 29 to 24. That's math, not my mind.
Well, no, but why aren't you quoting the polls where there's a 20 point lead?
Well, you do hear it. Romney's guy went on and said I think he's going to get out before Iowa.
He asked me an innocent question, would you ever get out? I said, yes, if I never thought -- if I thought I wasn't going to win, I'm not a masochist. I told him that. I'm not a masochist. If I thought I was going to win. And they end up saying Trump, look, he might -- it's so disgusting. I tell you what, the media is so dishonest, it's so disgusting.
Well, I'm trying to ask you honest questions. Let me ask you about this --
Well, I'm giving you an answer. OK, let me make it a little bit different. I'm not getting out. I'm going to win. OK? I gave a very honest answer but the press takes an answer like that and they make it like oh, there's a big story, they make headlines out of it. It's ridiculous.
All right, I asked you about it. Let's move on.
The question is would you get out? The answer is I'm not getting -- I'm going all the way and we're going to win. OK? It's a simpler answer and people can't play around with that. I mean, I watch these politicians. You know they're getting out in the next two weeks. And they say, oh, I'm never getting out. They're not telling the truth.
All right, I take your answer on that. You're not getting out. Good to know.
I am not getting out. OK. Very simple.
Well, people were weighing in.
Wait a minute.
People were weighing in. It seems like you could have weighed in, you just didn't.
They didn't ask me -- now, how can I speak -- how can I speak, OK? And how can I answer questions when they don't ask me any questions?
You have no problem speaking when not asked a question.
That's not right. I was asked many questions and then in the last 38 minutes they didn't ask me any questions. So a lightweight like this Rubio, who's a total lightweight, by the way, believe me, he's weak on immigration. He's got such problems.
Right. You think you have to win Iowa and New Hampshire?
I don't know but I'm leading in both. I think I, you know, might very well be able to do that. I'm certainly leading in both and leading significantly actually in one and I'm going up to Iowa tomorrow. And we have a packed house as usual and it's going to be a lot of fun. I'm having a lot of fun doing it.
I want to ask you some things that you haven't been asked. And that is a challenge because you do a few interviews.
I do, I do.
The economics of deporting 11 million immigrants, that -- it just doesn't seem to add up for a lot of people.
A lot of them -- you're going to make it so tough -- look, you're going to make it so tough that they're going to leave. Many of them are going to leave. We're going to make it so tough many of them are going to leave. And they're here illegally. We either have a country or we don't.
Right. But back to the issue, you said -- in 2005, you said you agree with the Kelo case in the U.S. Supreme Court, 100 percent. And that basically upholds eminent domain.
Eminent domain -- number one, a person has a house and they end up getting much more than the house is ever worth. Eminent domain is not like they take it. These people because they're not very smart people, the Club for Growth people. And actually, I don't want to use the word "extortion", but pretty close. They came up -- they wanted $1 million, they would have been --
But other candidates are now using and talking about the issue.
No, but think about it. Think about it. They come up and they ask me for $1 million. I say $1 million for what? I never even heard of the Club for Growth until six months ago.
Yes.
I mean --
But the Club for Growth is -- let's talk eminent domain.
Yes, but this is one of the points I make. They ask for $1 million. I say no, then they come out against me, they take some ads. Ok, big deal -- didn't have any impact at all. But eminent domain was one of their issues. So if you have a road or a highway --
I get that.
-- you're going to do it.
I know but if they don't want to sell.
Well -- look -- I mean --
But we can move on. I know what you mean.
I agree. I think it's a great subject -- it's a very interesting subject. I fully understand the conservative approach but I don't think it was explained to most conservatives.
There's a lot of other targets there, too, the Syrian rebels.
Ok. The rebels.
Two things, you would negotiate with Putin, you'd have a better relationship?
I would probably have a good relationship with him and maybe not. If I didn't, I'd have somebody that would. My whole life has been making great deals -- that's what I do. Not deals, great deals.
You said, the U.S. should take some refugees in.
I did.
So what's your number -- what's your number of coming in?
Well, I said, when I heard 3,000 -- don't forget this started a month ago --
You don't want to do center seat. So I thought we'd ask some of the panelists for a couple of questions and bring it to you.
Ok.
All right. So here's her question.
I've fallen in love with her.
Here's her question.
By the way, there was nobody nastier to Trump than her and now I'm in love with her.
Charles Krauthammer, who by the way in Canada Casino put his first money on --
I saw that. I couldn't believe it.
You see that.
Thank you, Charles. I'm going to make you look good, Charles. I was so impressed by that, he told everybody.
That's an uptick.
That was a shock.
Yes. But small government, big government?
I'm small government and I'm very little regulation. You know the regulations are killing. If you look at small businesses and big businesses -- not even small, big businesses -- but you look at businesses in this country, they are regulated to a point they can't even function any more. No, I am a small government person, but I do want to have a very, very strong military.
So you're in it to win it?
I'm in it to win it.
Thank you for your time.
Thank you.
Good morning, Mr. Trump. Mark Halperin here.
Hi, Mark.
So you're one of the leaders of the Republican Party now and you're a man with a lot of opinions. You took some credit for getting rid of Kevin McCarthy. If your choices are John Boehner staying on, Paul Ryan or other, what would you pick?
Well, I don't want to get involved in that too much. I did think we needed a very much tougher voice than what we had because there's so many things that the Republicans could do if they knew how to negotiate and if they had some unity. I look at so many times, you'll have some people out there and really putting themselves out. But they have no back from the rest of the party, but --
So having gotten involved, don't you need to tell people who you would like?
Well, I think that -- no, I don't think I need to because I'm not in that particular system. But I would say this, I think there seems to be a little bit of unification around Paul Ryan who is a good guy, but I would say that I have four or five people that I would have in mind that are tough people that a lot of people wouldn't be thinking of, and that I have known but I don't think they would have much of a chance but I think they would do a very good job.
Hey, Donald, it's Donny. How are you?
Hi, Don. How you doing, Don?
Marco Rubio?
And it could be somebody that you know very well that maybe wouldn't be in that group. But it's a little too soon for me to do that, Don. I think it would be a mistake.
Mr. Trump, did you say you expected one of the current Republican presidential candidates to get out of the race? And if so, who?
Well, I'd rather not say. But I'm hearing one is going to be getting out very soon.
Give us a hint.
When you're at zero. I mean, we have a number of them at one. It must be awfully hard to go on like that. So, one I hear is getting out soon.
Give us a hint about the identity of the person.
I think you're going to end up with four or five in the end, and that's fine with me.
Do you think Rand Paul is going to get out of the race soon?
I do. I think he has to go back to the people of Kentucky. I think the people of Kentucky are not being treated fairly by him and I think he's going to have to either do one thing or the other. I don't think it's fair to the people of Kentucky. A great state and great people. I don't think it's fair to them.
Yes.
-- which is a big statement nowadays especially in light of what's going on yesterday. But I would like to see some unity. No, I hit Marco because he attacked me three weeks ago I guess to get some numbers or whatever. I think he's a very nice guy. I don't really know him well.
Yes. Well, thank you for being with us, Don. We are fascinated around the table all the time when we have people coming on saying you're about to lose or you'r about to drop out of race or you peaked.
Or I've hit my plateau. You know, they've said that every single time I went up, Joe. I've hit my plateau.
Well, let's take an example of some case where you may or may not use military force. It turns out Assad apparently used chemical weapons on his own people. Does President Trump use force or not in that case?
Well, you know, the time to have done it would have been when he drew the line in the sand.
You have a concealed weapons permit.
Yes.
When did you get it?
Years ago.
Why?
Because I like to have myself protected.
Do you carry on a...
Sometimes.
What about teachers?
I think that if you had the teacher, assuming they knew how use a weapon, which hopefully they would, you would have been a lot better when this maniac walked into class starting to shoot people.
But, again, on favorability in our poll, only 28 percent of voters overall -- and this is -- we're talking about a general election here -- in our poll have a favorable opinion of you.
But I win hands down on leadership. Right? By far. It's not even close, double and triple anybody else. That's very important to people now. They wanted leadership. They're tired of having weak and incompetent leaders, John.
You say again and again that most political journalists, not all, most political journalists are dishonest in the way they cover you. Why do you think that is?
There's great dishonesty in the media. And I didn't see it to the same extent with the financial media, you know, I've only been a politician now for three months, but they don't want to cover me accurately. I see such dishonesty. A couple sites like Politico, it's totally dishonest.
In fact, you tweeted about Politico the other way, I wonder why somebody doesn't do something about the clowns at Politico and their totally dishonest reporting. In another tweet you called Politico pure scum.
They are dishonest. They write things that are not true. They never even call us. They very rarely even call. They will say things that are unbelievably wrong, purposely. They'll estimate the size of a crowd as being a tiny fraction because everything I do, I sell out. You know the crowds as well as I do. We had 20,000 the other day in Oklahoma, we had 35,000 people in Alabama.
You think that's deliberate?
Totally. Somebody said they're a liberal site -- is by the way, I know nothing about them. I hear they're losing a lot of money, whether that's true or not -- but the Washington Post is very interesting because they started to really capture my campaign. It's been very interesting. The Washington Post has been -- Bob -- is really very professional. I find New York Times as very mixed. I have some that are fabulous. Maggie is great and a couple, and then outliers.
You're also the front-runner.
Well, maybe, but even maybe without that, O'Reilly the same thing, Greta the same thing, Hannity the same thing. They get much bigger ratings.
But I believe it was an online survey.
I don't know if it was not. I was leading by a lot, and by the way, on CNN I was leading by a lot, but it wasn't quite as good. NBC used the CNN poll. And I said to them during the interview, just out of curiosity why aren't you using the NBC? I think the reporting -- I think at the same time you have been great, O'Reilly is tough as hell every time I do it, but he's great. He's fair. Somebody said thin-skinned or not thin-skinned, I don't mind at all being criticized if I deserve it, but there a couple of people on Fox that are brutal and for no reason, really for no reason.
Conservative commentators may disagree with you logically...
Well, that's different.
Last year you were beaten up on sleepy-eyes Chuck Todd, and you've done Meet the Press several times. Does your opinion of journalists rise if they like you?
No, if they're fair. I didn't think he was fair to me initially. Now I was a novice. I've never run for office before. It was three months -- I've only been doing this for three months, but for almost three months I'm at the top which is pretty cool when you think of it. When they compare me with a man like Herman Cain, when they compare with me Michele Bachmann who I also like, they were there for like one week. I've been there from the beginning.
Very, very different.
It's been a long run.
Let's drill down to government spending. It's a long question so bare with me. The Conservative Tax Foundation says your tax cut plan would cost $10 trillion. I know you dispute that. You said you don't want to touch social security, Medicare, Medicaid. Together they're 1.7 trillion. I know you want to go after waste, fraud and abuse, but if you slash taxes and you put half the budget is sacrosanct, likely blow a hole in the deficit.
But we're going to build a country. We're going to take our jobs back from Chine, we're going to take our jobs back from Japan, and I'm the only one that can do this. Other people have no clue.
But there is math involved. You want to build up the military.
You know how many jobs we have lost to other countries where they have ripped us like we're a bunch of babies? We're going to bring our jobs back, we're going to bring manufacturing back. With -- as an example social security, Medicare, you sign up for social security, that's a lifetime -- that's your contract. You have signed that contract. It's there. If you can't do anything about it, but in my case I can because I'm going to grow the economy to a level that nobody thought possible and I'm going to bring all our jobs back.
Automatically translates into...
It does. I took a tiny beautiful little company started by my father and I gained tremendous knowledge from my father, because he was a great negotiator, and I built it into a massive company that is now worldwide. We are here on the best location in the world. Without doing that good job, and as part of it, without such a great job, and you say my financial statements that are then times better than anybody ever thought, but without doing their job, you wouldn't have the same credibility. I'm saying this, Howard. I'm going to take jobs back from China and all these countries that have ripped this country off.
And he's not in your league.
I'm not saying it. What I'm saying is he has not handled his financial affairs very well. You look at his credit cards, you look at his problems, and I said he was a lightweight, but you have to remember this, he started with me, and about two weeks ago he started hitting me. I didn't start with him. Everybody who's started hitting me goes down in the polls. I hope that translates into running a country.
On that point, you haven't spoken much lately about Jeb Bush. Is he no longer a threat to you in this race?
No, I think he's a nice person. I went after him at the beginning, because he went after me, but I went -- he's out there pitching. I can't tell you what's going to happen. Don't forget, when I started, I was never going to run according to the pundits, and Jeb Bush had it made, Rand Paul had it made, and if you think about it you're Governor of Wisconsin, Walker who is a very nice guy also.
He's gone.
And he's gone. They were the ones that were going to win, one of those three and it's not looking like that.
So why are you questioning Carson's ability to be President?
I don't question anything. I tell you, I respect him and I like him a lot. He made a statement about me, and he withdrew it immediately. He absolutely said the press convinced him to make that statement or talked him into it, and we know the press.
He said it to me.
Was that statement originally made to you?
No, no, when I interviewed him, he said it was a mistake to take the statement and he apologized.
Honestly that shows a great man. I was all set to go wild. Now I can't go wild. I'm actually saying I wish he had hit me.
You've said many times that you opposed George W. Bush's Iraq war, but you said this in 2004 more than a year in, when it was pretty clear the occupation was a mess. Did you oppose the war before the invasion in March of 2003?
Yes, I opposed it all the time. Listen you have to understand, when I opposed it, I was a business guy.
You weren't required to make a public statement.
I wasn't a politician, but it was lucky in a way because I found a big article in Reuters, 2004 in July, headline, Trump opposes the war. I also was about two years before that, I totally opposed the war because I said it's going to destabilize the Middle East, and Iran would take over because they always fought, those two fought for years.
I'm not questioning your feelings on it, but there seems no public record.
It made sense. And by the way, when the World Trade Center was knocked down, they didn't send their families back to Iraq, they sent their families to Saudi Arabia.
I've written and spoken about the coverage of your wife Melania. New York Times profile says her twitter feed reflects a seemingly isolated life of beauty rituals, private jet rides, and bikini body, and if she wasn't married to you say the Times her life might resemble that of any number of trophy spouses in New York, Palm Beach, and Paris. How do you feel about that?
She's a great woman, she has a tremendous heart. She's great outer beauty but a great inner beauty. She's been on the cover of Vogue, she was a very, very successful model. She did really well before she met me.
Was the article unfair?
I don't know. I don't know what to think anymore. I get so much press it's unfair, it's like dancing.
Are you worried that as she plays a greater role she gave an interview to People Magazine, some of the press will denigrate her, writer her off as a...
People Magazine was so respectful of her and me. She's got tremendous warmth and a tremendous heart. And I think when it comes to women's health issues and other things, I think she's going to a standout. I will say somebody wrote on a tweet, I don't care if you're President, but she's got to be the first lady, which was pretty cool. Maybe I shouldn't be telling you that.
She's more popular than you are.
She's going to be great and a great representative of the country, that I can tell you.
Yes. You know, another thing that came up -- I noticed that you spoke at the No Labels event. I think it was in New Hampshire. And a woman said, Well, I don't think you're a friend of women. I've been to Trump Towers. I've spent time with both your wife, a lot of time with your daughter. I've seen her every time I've been over there.
Right.
All right...
So I'm very proud of my record with women.
Yes.
It's straight across the board.
You know...
So I'm very happy about that. I think we're going to do great.
Yes.
And I mean, I've heard that suggestion. A lot of people like that idea.
All right. Mr. Trump, good to see you. Always good to have you back on the program. And thanks for being with us.
Thank you very much.
Yes, it was a -- it was a tough night. But you look at all these polls.
I thought he had a rough night.
Right.
And the pledge is that we honor a lot of different things. But I'm going to all the way through. I'm going to all the way through.
But does it bother you then when you see a piece, like a Jeff Greenfield on Politico, how to tell the difference between a front-runner and fake runner, Vanity Fair, the serious problem with taking Donald Trump seriously, the pollster John Zogby telling various wire services he's going to fizzle out shortly, that no matter how long you're in this, no matter how long you're on top, they still say you're a phenom and that's it?
Well, my life has not been one of fizzling out. I have been a winner. I have won a lot of things, a lot of different things, too, not just in real estate or whatever I do. I have had a lot of victories in my life.
You do come under a lot of heat. At this No Labels event in Manchester, New Hampshire, yesterday, there was talk the one young woman who asked you questions might have been a Bush plant. I think your campaign has said that.
She was a Bush plant. Oh, no, she was a Bush plant.
He's about the only one. But he's about the only one you have not dissed, at least publicly.
You know, Ben Carson -- Ben Carson has treated me...
Well, they want to unionize. They want to unionize at this casino, right?
Yes, they want to try and unionize.
Donald?
Good morning.
You were bored weren't you?
It wasn't an exciting debate. I wanted to turn but I promised people I was going to tweet. I wanted to go off so badly, but I thought it wouldn't sound nice if I refused to watch potential opponent's debate. It doesn't right.
Less for the same job.
But it's also changing around, Mika, and it's changing around fast. I gave an answer that was very well-accepted. And that was -- interestingly, that was plant by Jeb Bush, which is a pretty big plant, and it was interesting the anger that she had. That's why I figured something was a little strange.
But, Donald let me -- so for this issue is something I study. And I understand that your answer might have been well-received in the room and I didn't necessarily have a huge problem with your answer.
Good. Accepted.
But that's not the average, Donald.
I have it to a large extent the reverse in the Trump Organization and I think it's based on competence and based on the job they do, and that's the best way you can legislate.
Hey, Donald, it's Willie. Good to talk to you this morning.
Hi, Willie.
We all love you and we all want to ask you questions. Willie's going to do a follow up and we got Mike and the daughter of a man who absolutely adores you, Nicolle.
Oh, good. I know who that is.
So, Donald, just real quickly, get back to my question. I understand you don't like the policies of Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders. But do you view firms like Goldman Sachs generally as a force for good in this country?
Yes, I do.
You do?
I do. Absolutely, I do. They're a fantastic firm. They make money, but they put people to work. They raise a tremendous amount of capital. They're highly respected all over the world.
Donald, do you know people there?
I do, many.
Could you get Willie and me a job at Goldman Sachs?
I think you would find it very boring compared to what you do right now.
Yes, bingo.
But you would make a lot of money.
Are you hosting "SNL"? Is that what I read?
Yes, I am, on November 7th.
That's massive.
I got a call from Lorne Michaels. He said the other day, he said, would you do me a favor and host "SNL"? And I did it about nine or ten years ago, I hosted it and it was a lot of fun. You know, it's a great honor to host "SNL". I think.
Yes. It is.
It's a great honor to be on "60 Minutes " last week with my stable mate Vladimir Putin.
Yes.
This is the biggest honor at all. This throws everything away.
Donald, thank you so much for having the patience to watch the entire Democratic debate.
It wasn't easy.
That's like running a marathon with a piano on your back.
It was not easy, I can tell you, but it was done and she did her job. In all fairness, like her or not, she did her job and they were very, very kind. And they probably, if they wanted to win, they should have been a lot tougher in my opinion.
Thank you, Donald.
Thank you very much.
Now for the top story tonight: reaction. Joining us from his campaign headquarters in New York City, Republican presidential contender, Donald Trump. Now, you were tweeting during the debate. Can you tweet and watch at the same time? Is that possible?
Well, I had plenty of time because that was a pretty boring debate but I did and picked up like I hear 160,000 followers last night. So a lot of people were listening which is great as far as I'm concerned.
Did you actually watch the debate though?
I did. I actually did. I felt I had an obligation. I would have rather have watched other things to be honest but I have an obligation because I may be running against one of those folks and you know, you can't go two hours, it's not that long a period of time. I will say that CNN did not hit them like they hit us. They didn't make them fight and there was very little fight in the group -- Bill.
Well, they wanted to make you look bad. Yes, yes. CNN --
No, no, they didn't do that last night.
You think the Democrats dictated to CNN. You think the Democrats told CNN what they were going to do? That's a pretty tough charge.
I think that's very possible.
Really?
No, I don't think so. I don't see anything wrong with it even. I think, look, the way they spoke with us it was pitting against each other. Everything was like this one said that, how do you respond, Mr. Trump.
Rejoining us now from his headquarters in New York City Donald Trump. That's from the Joe Namath playbook, is it not?
Well, we are just having fun. The question was asked "why are you doing so well" and I just thought that would be fun. Every once in a while we can have a little bit of fun.
All right. So it's inexperience --
-- and Ben doesn't have that kind of experience.
Ok.
And by the way unless you turn things around from a trade standpoint and all of those deals, this country is going to go down, Bill, because we are losing a fortune.
Your unfavorable rating is high -- highest of all the Republican candidates, about 50 percent in some polls. Do you have a plan to bring that down to make people like you more? Do you have a plan?
Well, I'm also number one in leadership by far by a factor of two and three if you saw that poll that just came out. And some people don't love me but I get the highest marks in leadership. I get by far the highest marks on the economy. You know, there is some pretty important categories when you go up to New Hampshire.
No, I understand that. But just the people -- are you worried about the people who don't? Are you going to try to persuade them to like you? And if so how are you going to do that?
Well, every place I go where I spend time -- New Hampshire, Iowa, South Carolina -- you saw those polls come out today, they're phenomenal. Not only leading by 20 and 25 points but I do very well in favorability. So where they get to know me, where they come for speeches and we all get to know each other I do very well in favorability.
All right. So it's retail politics is going to be able to do that.
I haven't been able to do that nationwide yet but that's happening. I think we will be able to do it. I think leadership is very important. I think the leadership poll is the most important to be honest and on that I'm double digits ahead of everyone else. In fact, two or three times in some cases ahead of everybody else. And I think leadership today is going to be really the most important thing.
Ok. Now you are well aware that some people feel that you are an entertainer and not a serious candidate. "Saturday Night Live" has gotten you now signed on to come over to do a show in November. And the Hispanics are real mad now at NBC. They don't want you to host the show. Any reaction to that?
No reaction at all. I just -- I think you saw the poll in Nevada where I'm leading with Hispanics. I'm doing very well with Hispanics. I think I will win with Hispanics which will surprise a lot of people. But I think I'm going to end up winning.
What makes you feel that way? What about your message is going to make Hispanic-Americans vote for you?
Because I'm bringing back jobs to this country --
Jobs -- ok.
I'm taking it away from China and Japan --
Muy bien.
And I think I'm going to win that vote.
El Trump, muy bien.
Yes, right.
"Saturday Night Live", what if they start mocking you? You know, they're definitely going to do the hair deal. If I were you I would wear your hat on that show, the whole show so they couldn't get the hair.
Well, you know, I actually hosted it 10 years ago and Lorne Michaels called me up the other day. He said I'd love to have you host and I agreed to it because it's an honor. I did "60 Minutes" last week -- that was an honor. My stable mate was Vladimir Putin and we did very well.
Yes.
That was the highest rating in a long time. I think "Saturday Night Live" will be a lot of fun, Bill.
But never forget, the biggest honor in your life is being on THE FACTOR. Can't forget that.
That is true. There's no question about it.
All right.
Number one. That's true.
Right.
So I think it's really important that they make it a reasonable period of time.
Are you asking for it?
I would hope they are doing the right thing.
Last night, we had a guest here ON THE RECORD. His name is Eric Trump.
Yes.
Donald, thank you, and I hope that we are looking forward to introducing your wife to the ON THE RECORD audience, as well as Ivanka to come here and your son, Don. So I hope you put a little pressure on them, will you?
Absolutely, Greta, I will.
All right, thank you, Donald. Nice to see you.
Thank you very much.
In order to be the President of the United States, you have to be a leader in so many ways. We haven't seen your soft hand. We've seen your offense, but George W. Bush had to stand in front of America after 9/11, Barack Obama did after Sandy Hook. Help us understand who Donald Trump is as a man. I need to know that you will make us feel safe and you will make us feel proud.
I think I have a bigger heart than all of them. I think I'm much more competent than all of them. When you talk about George Bush, and say what you want, the World Trade Center came down during his time.
Hold on, you can't blame George Bush for that.
He was president. Blame him, or don't blame him, but he was president. The World Trade Center came down during his reign. If you look at Sandy Hook, those people are still begging for help. It is a disaster, and it is a disaster all over the place. Government has proven to be a disaster during the Obama administration. What we need is a leader. We don't have a leader.
Mr. Trump, good to see you again.
Thank you.
Before we dig down into some issues, I want to see how much of a disruptor you would be. And let's do a lightning rod of quick questions --
OK.
Cutting spending.
But we're cutting -- we're going to be cutting tremendous amounts of -- of money and waste and fraud and abuse. You know, they had a case --
Who's going to protect the environment?
They -- we'll be fine with the environment. We can leave a little bit, but you can't destroy businesses.
But this brings up the point, the conservative American Enterprise Institute says, look, Donald Trump, he owns a dozen hotels, properties, all over the world. Your Trump Collection clothing line, some of it is made in Mexico --
It's true.
-- and China.
That's true. I want it to be made here.
I know. But the point they say is you're doing just what Ford is, you're taking --
Sure.
I understand that. And that's the idea of using -- taking private property for a public use. But --
And, by the way, people get paid for it. Everyone thinks they don't get paid. They get paid a lot of money.
I understand. But in the Kilo case, the big Supreme Court case in 2005, they took somebody's home and they sold it and then paid -- bought it. And then they gave it -- sold it -- to private entrepreneurs, private developers. And that's the question --
That's different.
But that's the question I'm going to ask you --
But that's different.
But let me ask you since you were involved in a case like this, as you know, in the 90s --
That's true. That was an economic development.
-- in Atlantic City.
Sure.
You had your hotels, and you wanted to build a parking lot where some woman had her house --
She saved me a fortune.
Which brings me to the question of temperament, which I think you would agree is important --
I think it's very important.
-- in a president. First of all, what's the deal with the tweets? Why are you sitting there at night watching TV and tweeting out?
Well, I think it's fine. It's a great way of getting my word out. I love Twitter and tweeting, and I have -- between that and Facebook, I have like 10 million followers. It's a great way. You know, now if you do something bad to me, I can tweet about Chris. And the world will be singing.
But does Mrs. Trump ever say, "Donald, turn off the TV? Come to bed."?
Oh, I don't do that much. And usually it's not too late. No, I just think it's an amazing way -- you know, we're in a modern age now. We have to get with it. Twitter and Facebook and all of this stuff is, to me, I mean, for some reason -- I'm probably not the youngest person using it. But for some reason, it works very well. I'm setting records. In fact, for the debate, you know -- I'm talking about the Democrat debate -- and they use Democratic. It's really Democrat. You know that, OK? They called that wrong. It's really the Democrat. But the Democrat debate, I picked up more followers by many times than anybody else. And there were those that said I won the debate because I picked up all the followers. But no, I think it's a great, modern way of getting the word out.
And a communist. Do you think that's presidential --
Yes.
Is that the way you would act in the White House?
I'm running against a lot of people. And they come out and attack me, very viciously, very viciously. I mean, Perry, I thought he was a nice guy. He was always a friend of mine. He had won campaign contributions. He was always very nice. All of a sudden, boom, I hit him very hard. I hit Rand Paul very hard. Look what happened then. I'm a counterpuncher. I don't have a choice. If you look what they say about me, it's terrible. I mean, they say terrible things about me. Bobby Jindal -- you talk about lightweights, this guy is a real lightweight. And he hit me -- I don't even know this man -- and he hit me because -- and they're not hitting me on fact. They're hitting me in order to try to pick up something in their polls. The thing I'm most honored about is every single person that went after me, including Jeb Bush, who's down -- boom. Every single person that went after me has gone way down. And I'm very honored by that. And that's what the country needs. The country needs a leader that when the country gets hit, we're going to come out on top, not keep going down. Because we're going down. Our country is going down.
Then I want to bring up the subject -- hear me out -- of you and me. During the debate, I asked you a question about bankruptcy.
Right.
Then, for about a week, you go after me. You say blood's pouring out of my eyes, you compare me unfavorably to my father. And I agree -- he's one of a kind. Here's the question: You're running for president. I mean, we talked to Chris Christie about Bridgegate. We talked to Carly Fiorina about --
Destroying the company.
OK. So I guess the question is...
No, it's not personal.
First of all, whatever happened to that nice soft- spoken young man?
I know. I know. I know.
But was that a fair question for him to ask you?
I thought it was fair, because it was very controversial at the time and I thought it was fair.
Not to press my luck, but true or false, you, at one point, considered and tried to put homeless people in some of those apartments to force the tenants to move out.
No, I talked about doing it, and I talked about doing it as a charity. That's right. We have a thing called...
If you end up as the Republican nominee and she's the Democratic nominee, how would you take her on?
I'd take her on tough. I'd just take her on on her record. I'd discuss her record. I think her record is abysmal. And I would take her on on her record.
Let's talk about all of this now. Joining us by phone, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Good morning, Mr. Trump.
Good morning.
Thanks so much for being here. Let's talk about these new polls hot off the presses this morning. You once again are leading the pack. As we just said, you have 27 percent. You've gone up three points since last month.
Right.
Your closest competitor is Ben Carson there, he's gone up eight points since last month. But let's talk about you, because you have defied all of the conventional wisdom, the pundits said by now we'd be seeing the polls drop, your numbers plummet or you would have gotten out of the race or you would have imploded. What do the pundits not realize about you?
They don't know me. They don't know where I come from. They don't understand about winning and I enjoy this. I'm seeing, as you know, I was at a place last night which was so incredible. We were -- the crowd of people that we have is incredible. It's incredible. I was in South Carolina and the place was packed. And the enthusiasm and the love in the room, it's love. It's beyond a regular going to make a speech. Love in the room. People want to see something happen. I was in New Hampshire. I was in Iowa. I was in Virginia the other day. We had 10,000 people. Last night we had 8,000 people. It's that way all the time. The only thing that stops even more are the size of the arenas. You can't get bigger.
I do want to get to what you talked about last night in one moment. But first just a couple more things about the polls. Because Ben Carson is running second to you. He's at 22 percent. Could there be any two more different people? How do you explain that you both are winning with Republicans?
Well, we've hit a chord. We're not as different as people think. We have a very good relationship. We're not as different as people think. There's certainly a different style. You know, I have great assets and he has great assets. But we are both resonating, there's no question about it. NBC just came out with their poll and it's similar. I'm in first place and Ben's in second place. And I went up a lot and from my original, I've gone up a lot. And you know, the other candidates are similar. Maybe these polls are starting to accurate out.
Can you imagine a Trump/Carson ticket?
Well, I like him. He likes me. I mean, stranger things have happened. That I can tell you. But it's too early to think about that. It certainly is interesting. So many people have suggested it because we seem to be doing awfully well.
Yes. Very quickly, can we talk about Carly Fiorina for a second?
Yes.
You two have obviously had your issues in the past. How do you explain how her poll numbers have plummeted? She had this big bump after the debate, she's gone from 15 percent to now 4 percent.
That's a big drop. I don't know. I like Carly, actually. I don't know why she would have dropped so much. That's a very, very big drop. There's no answer to that. A couple of others have dropped pretty good, too. There's no answer to Carly. She's talented. I'm surprised to see that much of a drop.
OK. Let's talk about last night. You were in South Carolina. You had, as you said, a passionate crowd there. You said something to them. You said -- about guns. You said, "You know the president is thinking about signing an executive order where he wants to take away your guns. You hear about this?" Now, Mr. Trump, the president has not signed an executive order to take away guns.
No, I've heard that he wants to and I heard and I think on your network, somebody said that that's what he's thinking about. I didn't say he's signing it. I said -- I think that will be a tough one to sign, actually.
Yes. It's impossible, in fact.
Yeah, I would say it would be impossible but nevertheless, he was thinking about it and I've heard it from numerous networks and I've read it in the papers. My source is the papers. They're pretty good sources.
The president constitutionally cannot sign an executive order to take away guns. So what are you doing? When you're telling --
He can't sign an executive order on immigration either and he did.
But when you're telling your crowd last night that he's coming after you and your guns, and you know that not to be true --
Well no, he has been in different forms. He's very much against -- in my opinion -- he's against the Second Amendment, which is ridiculous. He has certainly not been pro Second Amendment. You can say that at a minimum. Now I've heard from numerous sources and I've heard from the media. I've seen in the media, the papers, and I think if you look back, a couple of -- maybe a week, you'll see it on your own network, people were saying he is thinking about doing it. I didn't say he's doing it. I said, how is he going to do that given the Second Amendment? That's big league. But I -- He is -- Certainly, I think he is currently thinking about doing it.
Yes.
So I thought it was very obvious. It got a lot of push back. I didn't think it would be very controversial when I made it. I made the statement quite innocently, actually.
Well, I mean, it's because most Republicans don't say that when it comes to a terrorist attack that it was partially George W. Bush that didn't keep us safe. That was -- you definitely broke with convention by saying that.
Well it's OK, Alisyn. I've been doing that for a long time. If you look at what happened, No. 1, I would have had much stronger immigration policies. I'm not saying I would have prevented it but I would have had a chance because I'm pretty good at this stuff.
So -- but I want to ask you about that.
But I would have had, Alisyn --
Hold on, Mr. Trump -- Let me ask you about that.
I would have had much stronger immigration policies in effect.
So you would --
And I would have had a much tougher -- Well --
You wouldn't allow those going forward?
But Alisyn --
Yes.
They knew there was an attack coming. George Tenet, the CIA director, knew in advance that there would be an attack. He said so to the president and everybody else that would listen. That came out. The other thing is, the FBI, the NSE and the CIA were not talking to each other. These are the three main agencies. They weren't talking to each other and they weren't talking because they didn't like each other. And they had a lot of problems getting along. That's leadership. You have to, you know, you have to get your three main agencies to talk to each other. They had a lot of information that if it could have been correlated, it would have been very, very helpful.
So let's talk about Afghanistan, as you just brought up, because you have said a couple of conflicting things about whether or not you thought that it was right to go into Afghanistan. Ben Carson, as you know, this weekend said he thought going to war with Afghanistan after 9/11 was a mistake and at times you have said that as well. But at times you've flip-flopped.
No, I haven't said it. I haven't said it. Afghanistan is a different thing, it's next to Pakistan and Pakistan has nuclear weapons. OK?
So you think it was OK -- the Afghanistan war you do support?
It's an entrance to Pakistan and Pakistan has nuclear weapons. That's a different thing. It's a whole different kettle. One of the reasons I wouldn't have gone into Iraq, the two reasons, No. 1 they had no weapons of mass destruction. Bush wanted to do that for his father maybe. Actually his father did a good job. He went and knocked the hell out of Iraq but didn't get in. He didn't get into the quagmire. That whole Middle East is a quagmire. Anybody goes in, you're in a quagmire there. You can't get out. And it's not going to change. And it's not going to change with Syria either, by the away. It's not going to be changing with Syria -- It's like a quagmire, it's like being in quicksand, you can't get out. In the meantime, we have to build our own country. With Afghanistan it's different because they are next to Pakistan. Pakistan has nuclear weapons.
Yes. But I just want to ask you about how you feel about the Afghanistan war? Do you think it was a mistake going into Afghanistan?
Do I love it? No. Do I love anything about it? No. I like -- I think it's important that we No. 1 keep a presence there and ideally a presence of pretty much what they're talking about, 5,000 soldiers.
Right. But originally?
But I think we need to -- But we really need to do it for a different reason. We have Pakistan next to it and Pakistan legitimately has nuclear weapons.
Yes. But --
That's a real problem.
But originally you don't think --
It would be nice to have other people help us like China is taking all the minerals out of Afghanistan. You know, while we're fighting all the time, China is on the other side of the ridge with their big equipment with their excavators taking all the minerals out. They do nothing.
I just want to ask you --
They do nothing but make money.
But I just want to clarify that you do not think it was a mistake to go into Afghanistan after 9/11 because you did say on our air, let me read to you what you said on October 6th about Afghanistan. You said, "We made a terrible mistake getting involved there in the first place."
No, we made a -- no, no.
"We had real brilliant thinkers that didn't know what the hell they were doing and it's a mess."
We made a mistake going into Iraq. I've never said we made a mistake going into Afghanistan.
This -- Our question was about Afghanistan. That day on October 6th --
OK. I never said that. Wouldn't matter. I never said it. Afghanistan is a different kettle. Afghanistan is next to Pakistan. It's an entry in, you have to be careful with the nuclear weapons. It's all about the nuclear weapons. By the way, without the nukes it's a whole different ball game. But it's all about the nuclear weapons. That's going to be -- when Bernie Sanders gets up and says global warming is our biggest problem, I have news for him. The biggest problem is nuclear weapons, nuclear proliferation. That's the world's great problem right now. Believe me.
Yes.
I said, well, OK, but you have to add in, if you go back a few days, you have to add in a thing called the World Trade Center and they wouldn't do that.
Right. OK.
So I disagreed with that statement.
Yes.
And frankly, I've had tremendous support. It's interesting. A lot of people said we never thought of it that way. It's right. And at the debate, when he said that, I didn't want to say it because, honestly, I wanted to be respectful. I didn't want to say it but I've always thought it, whatever I heard, what a good job Bush did from the time -- after the attack and the job was fine. But what about the attack itself?
Let's talk about something that you were coy about last time I interviewed you. That was "Saturday Night Live." We do now know that you are expected to host on November 7th. There is a group of Hispanics who are boycotting that or who are protesting your appearance. They feel that you would not be a good representative to be on "Saturday Night Live " and they are going to try to spike your appearance. Do you think they will have luck with that?
I think they'll have luck in driving up the ratings, because the ratings will be higher than they would have been. This will be the highest rated show in a long time. I was on "60 Minutes, " they had the highest rating in over a year just two weeks ago. That was the highest rating -- And they had a lousy game in front of it, too. It was a blowout. And they had the highest ratings in over a year. "Saturday Night Live " will be -- some people think it will be one of the highest rated shows ever. I think they'll only drive up the ratings higher. These groups, I know these groups, many of them are scam groups. I have great relationships --
Who is a scam? Which group is a scam group?
I have fantastic relationships with the Hispanics. I employ thousands of Hispanics right now. Tens of thousands over the years I've employed. They're fantastic people. I have great respect for Mexico but Mexico is just taking advantage of our country. Their leaders are much smarter than our leaders and they're taking advantage of us in trade and at the border. Ford is moving a massive plan to Mexico. Nabisco is moving their factory to Mexico. Too much. It's no good. We have to keep -- Listen, one of the reason I'm leading in every single poll -- every single poll, every single state, I'm leading -- I mean, in South Carolina, I'm leading 38 to 12 or something. You look at some of these polls, in New Hampshire, I'm leading 36-10.
All right, Mr. Trump, always interesting to get your predictions and to talk to you. Thanks so much for being on NEW DAY.
Thank you for the good numbers. I always love to hear that.
We know you do. Sounds like you're having fun with all of this and we'll talk to you again --
I am.
-- soon.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
With your Republican opponents, you've gone straight after him, face to face, gone right at him.
Right.
Would you do the same with Joe Biden?
Yes, I would. I mean, I would -- I would just -- by the way, I'm always fair and I'm very much a counterpunch, you know, with the Republican opponents, I only hit after they hit me. And some of them I haven't hit at all, I have great relationships with some of them, I mean Perry from Texas and Lindsey Graham and some of these guys, they came at me for no reason. I mean, they were -- Rand Paul and the good news is everybody that's hit me has gone down, which is a wonderful thing. I mean, that's what we need for the country.
But it's not the politicians, it's President Obama primarily, isn't it?
Well, it's everyone -- he's a politician. It's every -- Stuart, it's everybody. It's everybody.
Well, it sounds like you're saying, no, we can't afford it.
Well, I'm not a big fan because I want to be competitive with other countries and that's what we're competing against and that's what we're losing to.
OK. Hillary Clinton proposals free pre-K for all.
Well, I don't like it because eventually you're going to have to raise everybody's taxes.
How about this one? Hillary Clinton and the president say do not build the Keystone Pipeline and you say...?
No. I would let the keystone pipeline be built. Absolutely.
You'd get rid of Obamacare as well as Dodd-Frank?
I would repeal Obamacare instantaneously and replace it with something much better, privately done, we get rid of the artificial lines around each state so that insurance companies can compete with each other. The insurance companies have made a fortune on Obamacare. I would get rid of Obamacare and replace it with something much better.
Well, we think of you as a business mogul, very success business guy, very successful entertainer but now you are you're a politician, you're into the world of politics. And if things go well for you, you've got another nine years of this.
Right.
I do know that, sir.
Much easier.
So you're in cash.
You know what I did, I sold it in January and the reason I did is I have so little confidence in our government. That's why I sold it.
Because you don't have confidence in the government?
Because I don't have confidence in our government, the people running our government, I don't have confidence in them and that's why I sold the stock.
Well, sir, you've been with us for 20 minutes and time really flew by. And thank you very much for being on the show.
It was my honor. Really my honor. Thank you, Stuart.
All right, here to respond to those remarks, 2016 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, welcome back, sir. How are you?
I'm very good, thank you, Sean.
I actually...
... because I actually said in the book that something would happen. Nobody talks about it. But I actually talk about the name Osama bin Laden.
They didn't find them.
But they never found them. I think they did use...
I think they probably moved them to Syria, myself.
Well, I don't know. They never found them. And frankly, they probably used them against Iran, which really was beautiful -- I mean, not that they used the weapons, but the beauty of it was you had these two countries that were equal in strength, and we decapitated one of those countries, and now Iran is taking over Iraq and everything else, and ISIS is taking oil and Iran is taking oil and they're taking over the whole country.
Yes.
So it's turned out to be really bad. With that being said, I respect the fact that Jeb is defending his brother. I think that's good. I would do the same thing.
A hundred percent.
Now, what we should do, at the same time from a humane standpoint, take a big chunk of Syria, and let's all put some money into it, if we have to, because on a humane basis -- and build a safe zone, what's called a safe zone. Let the people -- but to allow them into Germany and to allow them into these other countries, where there's nothing but a horror show00 you see what's happening. And now we're going to take in 200,000 people in this country?
It's insane. It's insane.
And we can't breathe! I mean, we don't know what we're doing!
You know, and I suggested the same thing, make it a secure zone, offer humanitarian assistance, offer food, water, medicine and supplies...
Fine, fine.
Will you fight back, then, with your own ads...
These people...
Have you give any thought, if you win the nomination, three people you would consider to be your vice president?
I have given thought, but I don't want to discuss it. It's just too early. I have to get there first. And you know, I don't like talking about -- you have so many people, they don't win, they don't know how to win. I don't want to talk about anything. I do know how to win, but that's so far down the road.
I heard you were supposed to be on Jimmy Kimmel tonight. Did something happen?
No, I have a political event, but I'm going to do his show in two weeks. I have a big political event, which I can't skip. And I told him, I said, you know, I have this event. I can't skip it. But I will be doing it in two weeks when I'm out in Los Angeles.
All right, Mr. Trump, thanks so much. We appreciate your time.
Thank you.
Yes, it would be interesting to see persuasive politics working in Washington, D.C. where the two of you might, for example, discuss illegal immigration, open borders and the Transpacific Partnership, the free trade agreement that you've criticized considerably.
Well, I'm very strongly against that and he's in favor of it, so that's a big difference, too but that doesn't mean we can't change minds.
There you go. It would be nice to see somebody change a mind in Washington, D.C.
It doesn't happen anymore it. It used to happen. It doesn't happen. Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan -- so it used to happen. Doesn't happen anymore, but it will happen again.
And one of the world's great straight talkers.
He is indeed, is he not?
Back to my question, why raise it?
Because I just said, I don't know about it. I said nothing about it. I would never say bad. I'd never say bad about any religion. And, as you know, in fact, I think you just had a quote on, I said exactly "I don't know about it." So, you know...
Ben Carson has asked...
-- that's not an insult.
Ben Carson has asked for an apology. Will you give it to him?
Well, I didn't say anything bad about it. I just don't know about it. I would certainly give an apology if I said something bad about it. But I didn't. All I said was I don't know about it.
So if you agree with these health savings accounts idea, do you also agree with Ben Carson when he says Medicare probably won't be necessary?
Well, it's possible. You're going to have to look at that, but I'll tell you what, the health savings accounts, I've been talking about it also. I think it's a very good idea and it's a -- it's an idea whose probably time has come.
Donald Trump, thanks very much for your time this morning.
Thank you very much, George.
Mr. Trump, thanks so much for doing this.
Thank you.
Another position where you two disagree is, he thinks everyone should pay taxes, including the poor. He proposed something like tithing from the Bible, where everybody pays 10 or 15 or 20 percent. You don't. You believe in progressive taxation.
I agree with him 100 percent.
Paul Ryan is likely to be the next speaker of the House. You have referred to him as weak on immigration.
Very weak on immigration.
Should -- should they...
We have to have a border. We have to have a wall. We're going to have a wall.
Why do you keep talking -- why do you keep talking about Jeb Bush, when Ben Carson is...
Well, because I always thought -- no, no, I talk about Ben Carson too.
Carson criticized your proposal to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants. He said it would cause the collapse of the farming industry. That's obviously something of major concern to people.
People can come -- they can come with visas. They come right back in. In other words, people can come back in with visas. And it's very simple.
This is the situation, though, that you will inherit if you become commander in chief.
That's right, and I think I will be very good at it.
The world would be better off with Saddam Hussein...
A hundred percent.
... and Gadhafi in power?
A hundred percent.
Mr. Trump, thanks so much for spending the time talking to us today.
Thank you very much.
OK. So an expression of ignorance, not raising questions about it?
Well, it's a harsh way of putting it, but perhaps I could say it that way, yes, because I just don't know about -- as I said, I don't know about that.
All right, Mr. Trump, thanks so much for your time.
Thank you very much.
So joining us by phone, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Donald?
Good morning.
Good morning. How are you doing?
Good.
So what's up in Iowa?
Well, I don't get it. I'm going there actually today and I have tremendous crowds and tremendous love in the room and, you know, we seem to have hit a chord. But some of these polls coming out, I don't quite get it. I was No. 1 pretty much in Iowa from the beginning, and I would say we're doing very well there. So I'm a little bit surprised. The other polls, as you know, in other states are extraordinary, actually. This one I on the quite get. I would have thought we were doing much better. I think we are doing much better, actually.
So Donald, if the polls keep going in this direction in Iowa, do you write it off like a lot of other candidates write Iowa off as a state where candidates like Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum and Pat Robertson do well and then sort of fade away?
No, I love Iowa, I love the people of Iowa. I've had a great relationship with the people of Iowa. I made a lot of friends there. No, I wouldn't write it off at all. I would fight for it. I'll fight right to the end for it. And if I don't win it, I understand that can happen, but I will be fighting for Iowa.
Good morning, Mr. Trump.
Good morning.
I want to ask you -- I'm trying to settle once and for all your relationship with polls. When you're ahead in the polls, you cite them. You act like they're scientific gospel. When we see polls where you're behind, sometimes you'll challenge the pollster, the organization, the methodology, the legitimacy of the poll. How do you determine which -- how do you justify or explain attacking polls where you're behind but celebrating polls where you're ahead?
Well I think you have to understand polls and when I was at school, when I was at Wharton we actually had a case on polls. We had a one month study on polls. I believe in polls. I generally believe in polls. The thing with these polls, they're all so different. They are coming from all over the lot where one guy is up here, somebody else is up there, you see swings of 10 and 12 points and immediately even the same day. So right now its not very scientific. I think it's very hard when you have this many. But overall, Mark, I'm a believer in polls. I think they say something. At least they spot a trend.
No, I agree. I agree. Here's the other question. From the guys that I've studied, FDR, Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, LBJ, one of their greatest traits is their ability when they make a mistake to learn from the mistake, acknowledge it and grow. What would you say is the biggest mistake you've made and what you've learned from it that will help you now to become a president?
Well, I think that I have learned that it's -- I want to be extremely cautious with words because you can say one word that you think is great in an audience. You may be in a local audience in New Hampshire, where I have such a great feel and such great friendships in New Hampshire, and you may say something, one word and you know it's a little bit controversial but you're in this audience, and the next day it's the front page of a newspaper. So you do have to be very careful with your language. There's no question about it.
You said also when you were asked about a month ago what you would do differently, seems like you said that again, you would guard your words a bit more carefully.
I think so. You know, it works well in a room with, you know, 1,000 people or 2,000 people and you're all having a lot fun together. But in the meantime, Mark Halperin sitting in the back of the room with his notebook, and it ends up being a somewhat catastrophic word. So everyone is laughing, everyone is having a good time until the next day when I say, you know, I shouldn't have said that. So you have to be very careful with your words.
What, for you, what was the low point of your life and how did you become a better person by walking through that personal hell?
I would say, you know, the loss of my parents. I lost my father and my mother and that was very difficult because I had great parents. But that is something that people go through and it's sort of, that's the way it's supposed to be in the chain of events, but I would say that the loss of my brother. I had a brother, Fred, and he taught me a lot and he was a terrific guy and when I lost him -- because that is not according to the way it's supposed to work -- a long time ago. And I was able to, you know, it was a very tough thing. I was able to get off the mat. But I had a wonderful brother, Fred, who was very instructive and taught me a lot.
How did that change you? How did that make you a better person, the loss of your brother?
Well, I just think that the fact that I was able to recover from it. He was very instructive. He was able to give me great advice over the years as to alcohol, as to smoking, as to -- you know -- drugs weren't prevalent, I guess, in those days. But it would have been that too. But he gave me great advice over the years. I would say because that's not the chain of events that you expect. That was something that was very tough.
Is that why you don't drink alcohol?
Yes, totally.
Because of his death?
Who knows, if I did, who knows if I'd even be talking to you right now. You know. I do have that type of personality. I may not be on the phone with you right now. So you know, that was actually -- he was a great teacher, in a sense.
Donald, good morning.
Hi, Gene.
Greatly appreciate it as always.
Thank you very much.
Joining us now with reaction to tonight's presidential debate is candidate, the number one front-runner in the polls, Donald Trump is here with us. Mr. Trump, how are you, sir?
Hi, Sean.
I've got to be honest. We spent a lot of time talking about this. Right out of the gate I felt John Harwood was extraordinarily unfair to you and attacking you in the line about the clown and unnamed sources that tell him that you would fly before that ever passed. I've got imagine that that's pretty aggravating for you. What's your reaction to it?
Well, I don't know. I think we did very well tonight. The debate itself went very well. And the audience started booing him. And I guess I expect it. I'm number one in the polls, and I would maybe expect it. But I thought it was unnecessary. And it was very interesting. I think the result was very interesting. But the evening was a great success.
What is your reaction, because in last 24 hours, 36 hours, John Kasich, the governor, seems to be getting more aggressive and hostile? Where do you think it's coming from?
Well, he has very bad poll numbers. It's very simple. So he attacked us. And I think it was inappropriate. But that just came from poll numbers. He seems like a nice guy. But he has very, very low poll numbers, and therefore he attacked us. So I think it worked out well for me.
Let me go to the issue of the substance of your economic plan, because there's a lot to it. And I don't know who these unnamed sources that John Harwood was talking about, but you talk about trillions of dollars that would be --
I don't think they exist. Sean, I don't think those sources exist. I don't believe they exist.
I actually got the impression it was his personal opinion. It was a great line when you mentioned Larry Kudlow who works on CNBC, and you said, well --
He's a good guy.
Mr. Trump, it's estimated that there is some $4 trillion overseas that multinational corporations won't bring back to this country because of the high taxation rate.
Right.
Corporate inversion, repatriation.
It is all about the corporate inversion, right.
But wouldn't those corporations spend the money here, build manufacturing here if they have ability to bring it back?
They would. They would spend it here. They want to bring it back. They can't bring it back. The tax is too high. And the bureaucracy is too high. The paperwork is unbelievable. They can't get it back in. So you know what they're doing. They're leaving it in our country and going to another country to get their money and get lower taxes, and they're taking thousands and thousands of jobs, Sean.
Let me ask you, when you talk about John Kasich being lucky and the whole issue of fracking, in a way I was thinking couldn't the whole country be lucky? Because we have more natural gas, more energy resources than the entire Middle East combined and we don't tap into it. How big of an impact, through your economic estimate and your economic plan, would it have on the economy?
Massive. Bigger than Saudi Arabia, bigger than anything, massive. If a state or area of the country is lucky enough to be sitting on the right soil and the right land, they should be doing it and they should make a fortune for themselves, cut taxes, do a lot of things. But absolutely they should do it. And some people don't do it. Some people don't do it. I mean, I can name one in particular that's not doing it and sitting on top of a bonanza.
You're talking about New York state, where I live. And upstate New York is suffering financially because of it.
It is sitting on a bonanza. And by the way, it's being lost, because Pennsylvania and others, believe me, are sucking it right now. So New York is losing a lot by not taking the oil and gas. They have tremendous power there. And you know how high taxes are in New York? We're losing a lot by not taking it. And other areas, like Pennsylvania, they're taking it. And that doesn't, you know go by lines. That stuff flows and they're taking it. New York is losing a tremendous amount.
It was interesting to me tonight to watch how bad the media was and to watch all the other candidates tonight in a very different way come to your defense. And that included Mike Huckabee. That included Ted Cruz. What was your reaction to that?
I thought it was great. We have a great relationship and I really thought it was great. There was a certain camaraderie up there tonight not only with respect to me but with respect to everybody. I thought it was very beautiful to watch.
Last question. The media seems to have a real hard time grasping the idea that you're going to build a wall and that you're going to make Mexico pay for it. And as you were trying to give your answer tonight I wanted to hear the rest of it. And I want you to explain to our audience exactly how that would happen because the media seems to lack a comprehension about how Mexico's economy is so tightly tied to our economy and that it would be in their best interest to do so.
Sean, we're going to build a wall. It's going to be paid for by Mexico. We're going to create a border, a real border. We don't have a border now. And if you don't have a border, you don't have a country. We're going to have a door for people to come in legally. But I will tell you, it's going to be a beautiful door, people are going to come in legally. But we're putting up a wall. Mexico is going to pay for it, and we're going to have a border.
And they pay for it why?
Because they make -- our trade imbalance with Mexico is $50 billion a year. We give Mexico a tremendous amount of money. I love the Mexican people. I employ tens of thousands over the years of Hispanics and people, generally. These are great people. But the leaders are too smart for our leaders. What's happening to us is a disgrace and it cannot happen any longer. So we're going to build a wall, we're going to create a border, and you're going to be very happy.
Last question, we're going to let you go. You've been probably the strongest critic of Governor Jeb Bush. Probably he's underperformed by every poll number out there. And for some reason he was out there attacking Marco Rubio. What do you think the strategy was behind it? You're number one in the polls. Ben Carson has been surging a little bit this week. What is your reaction to that, too?
Well, I think Ben is a terrific guy. And I think that frankly Marco and Jeb were going at it a little bit. And I sort of said that. And they were going at it. But Ben is standing right next to me and he is a terrific guy. He's right over here. Hey, Ben, you're a terrific guy. So that is the story.
Why don't you bring him over? We got a group hug on HANNITY. We'll have all the candidates together. I said this earlier, I actually said that it was the candidates that beat the moderators tonight. And in spite of what they wanted --
I think so.
This is was a substantive debate tonight.
I think so. And there were some little jabs. I'll tell you, there were little jabs, but there was a great camaraderie among candidates.
Mr. Trump, it's always a pleasure to have you. Thank you for taking time. Great debate for you tonight. Appreciate your time.
Thank you, Sean. Thank you very much.
Now for the top story tonight: reaction. Joining us from Sparks, Nevada, Donald Trump. So, you were a bit quiet last night. Was that a strategy?
I don't think it was really a strategy, Bill. I wanted to do a good job. I won in every poll as far as the debates are concerned. I think you have them in front of you. I don't think you are going to read them because you never do.
Well, it's Internet polls. We don't do Internet polls here so don't give me any grief on it. We never do Internet polls.
Well, that's all right. That's all right.
Go ahead.
That's all right. That's ok. I think I did well. I was very happy with the result. And, yes, I thought they were nasty but I was ok with it. I'm used to it.
You know, as few questions I have got, the last one I need is to give him some more time. I love Donald Trump. He is a good man. I'm wearing a Trump tie tonight. Get over that one.
Such a nasty question but thank you, Governor.
Ok. Step back --
Whether you like it or not that's the way it is.
You are not carrying now.
I have a license to carry. I have a license to carry. I'm not carrying now.
Ok.
No, I don't think I answer in a general way -- sometimes maybe.
Ok. Get back to your rally and as always we appreciate you coming on. Taking the flack and the fire and it's always good to talk to you, Donald. Thank you very much.
All right. Thank you, Bill. Thank you very much.
You know...
But you know, Ben Carson can't do that. It's not his thing. He has no chance. And we have to do it. We have to make our country rich again before we can make it great again.
It's insane!
... the top of the line -- these people go over there...
Yes. Well, let me ask you then...
He was a great divider -- he, Sean, a great divider. I really thought the one thing he would be a cheerleader for the country. I didn't know. Maybe he doesn't have the experience, he probably wouldn't be -- who knows. But he's turned out to be an unbelievable divider, and even comments like that are very divisive comments. But the bottom line, he's been a terrible president!
I agree with that.
They used to have 2 million people watching. Now they're having 24 and 25 million people watching, even though it is because of Trump, but I won't say that.
Let me...
But they have 24, 25 million people watching, they should give some of the money to the wounded warriors and to the veterans.
We better secure our border.
And I will tell you there's nobody that has my attitude on creating the border. And I will build a wall, and Mexico will pay for the wall. Sean, they're going to pay for it because they're making a fortune. We give them billions of dollars. People don't know this. We give them billions of dollars, and we have a trade imbalance with Mexico, $45 billion a year!
All right, we...
A wall is peanuts. No politician is going to make them do that, but I will.
"Saturday Night Live " -- you excited?
And that's just a few of the things.
Have you looked at what is going to happen?
Well, right after I finish with you, I'm going over to see Lorne Michaels and the people at Saturday Night Live, and we're going to start working on it. And we had fun. I did it 11 years ago. The Apprentice  was number one, and they asked me to do it. I did it 11 years ago. So here we are 11 years later for a different reason, I guess, I'm doing it this time. But it'll be a lot of fun.
All right, Mr. Trump, as always, thank you for your time. We appreciate it.
Thank you. Thank you very much, Sean.
I drove past it.
It was an incredible scene there.
I saw the lines. The book's selling well.
If you listen to Sara Murray, you would think were three people standing in the atrium of Trump Tower.
No, no, no. That's not the way she did it.
Well, that is the way she reports. She has no idea --
That's the way you took it. I understand.
Either she's a very unemotional person or she's not a very good reporter. One or the other.
All right. Let's talk about the tactic. First of all, I opened up your introduction and interpretation of the polls to give you your say. I didn't mention the Florida poll because our people in house don't like the methodology of that poll. We're not using it until we can confirm the numbers. The other ones I gave you --
But if somebody else were leading, I guarantee you'd be using it.
No, absolutely not. If the methodology isn't good, we don't use it.
OK, fine. I accept your word on that, Chris.
I appreciate it. I take yours as well. So when you use these tactics of negativity about the media, I get that they are working for you, but it's also my job to check them on you. You lumped me in with what you would call the Sara Murrays. You know she's a top-notch reporter.
I don't know that. No, I don't know that. I don't see it.
She does a good job. Well you've said the same thing about me, too, though, right? If I say something you don't like, you --
You are a top notch. I don't see it with Sara Murray.
All right. I'll take it for today.
She never reports on my crowd sizes. You know, we have the biggest crowds. She shows her face, never scans the room and shows the tremendous crowds I'm getting.
All right. Well let's make it about you, not Sara Murray.
And you know, it's one of those things. Maybe she's a low-key individual that doesn't believe in showing crowds. I see other people, they have crowds that are tiny by comparison and everybody shows their crowds. They never show mine.
Everybody is uniform in their reporting that you are certainly the biggest celebrity in the race. Nobody is questioning that. It's how it will translate into you as a leader, into you as president. That's what the testing is about. However, these tactics have worked well for you. The question is will they continue to? Yesterday you were outspoken about how you thought Hillary Clinton had gotten a pass, only easy questions in the debate. Now we both know you tweeted that you thought Anderson did a great job in the debate.
I said he did do a very good job. I thought he did a terrific job.
He was the one asking the question. So how did she not get good questions if he did a great job?
And by the way, he asked them tough questions but they weren't tough like the questions that we were getting and the questions that I was getting, it wasn't even a question from John Harwood. He was making wise guy statements with the questions.
Right. But that's one example from one guy.
And they went to Governor Huckabee, who is a terrific person by the way, and he asked him a question about me and Governor Huckabee let him have it. I thought he did a great job. The difference is, I thought Anderson Cooper did a great job, but comparison -- and they were tough enough questions but they weren't tough like us. Ours weren't even questions. They were statements given over by the moderator.
Bernie did. Not Anderson Cooper. That was Bernie's judgment, not Coop's.
No, no. Did he go into the emails with Hillary during that question -- during the questions?
Sure he did. He did his job. This is about you guys, not about the media.
I understand. There were other things. There were a lot of things that could have been asked of Hillary that could have been nasty, so nasty I don't want to bring them up. There are many things he could have asked. With that being said, I thought Anderson was professional and tough. But if you look at the questions that were asked of us, they were much tougher than that.
All right. So let's leave that as it is. The obvious --
They weren't even questions. They were statements.
The obvious takeaway, I think we'll both agree on this, is that you should do CNN as often as possible because it is obviously the fairest place doing the job at the highest level. Agreed?
And you'll get your best ratings.
Agreed? Agreed. Let's move on. The book comes out, the reaction is huge. People are looking at it, buying it, buying multiple copies. We start to look inside. There are two things I want to get your response on. There's this guy, Michael D'Antonio. I know that you were working with him in the beginning when he was doing his research then you cut him out. He tells a different story about how you got your start, the help you got from your family. My question to you is this. What is wrong with acknowledging the help that your father, who's one of the legends in New York City in terms of building a better city, what's wrong with the fact that you had a successful family who helped you?
My father was very, very proud of me. Michael D'Antonio wrote a third grade book. He's a guy I don't even know. I did two or three interviews with him, little ones. I saw where he was going. I left him. Walked out of the room. He worked with somebody from "People " magazine. He said my sister and brother and people gave me a $30 million loan. They didn't have $30 million. When I started out they didn't have 10 cents. They did well on their own and they didn't have money. My father never gave any money. When my father passed away he gave some, but by the time he passed away, I had already built my business, frankly. When my father passed away, who was a wonderful guy --
Yes.
By the way, your father really knew my father and liked him a lot.
He liked him, he respected him. He thought he was one of the giants of New York, that your father did the right thing for the right people and that's why he was respected by politicians and others.
My father wasn't -- You know, he was a builder Brooklyn and Queens. When my father -- When I went into Manhattan, my father didn't want me to go into Manhattan. My brothers and sisters didn't have money until my father passed away. When my father passed away, they got something from my father. Not nearly as big as people think. But they got something from my father. Whatever my father left was split up. Don't forget. I have two brothers, two sisters, me and other people got things, OK?
Right. I just don't understand --
Listen -- Just so you understand, by the time it was all split up we had a thing called estate tax, which is a massive tax, so you have to pay --
No question.
-- state tax or whatever you go. But by that time I had long built my company. But this guy D'Antonio said my brothers and my sisters gave $30 million -- They didn't have $30 million, especially in those days. You know, you're talking about -- he was talking about the '70s and '80s. They didn't have any money.
Right. My point of the question is, I know -- as you know, I know your family's history very well. Your father is basically beyond reproach as far as I'm concerned in terms of what he did for the city. What's wrong with acknowledging that he helped you early on?
By the way, my mother was a big fan of your mother. They used to use the same beauty parlor in Queens and I think they really loved each other. My mother thought your mother was one of great ladies. And by the way, so do I.
I get the case you're trying to make.
I will make great deals for this country. I'll get us out of debt because I'm very good at it. Nobody can do it like I do. By the way, Carson does not have the mentality to do that. He has no chance. And you look at Rubio, he's totally overrated. He has debt on his credit cards --
All right, good. You made the segue I need to make here, Mr. Trump.
Excuse me?
He says it differently than you and he doesn't say the kinds of things that you would say, which often you'll back up on but it still hurts in the moment.
Ben will not be able to deal with China. He will not be able to deal with Iran. He will not be able to deal with any of the countries that are really abusing our country. They're abusing it.
What is the proof that you could?
He will not be able to deal with Japan.
What is the proof you could?
Because that's not his thing. Frankly, when you talk about energy, he has lower energy than Bush.
What does that mean, "low energy"?
You're not going to do anything.
But what does that mean, "low energy"?
I don't know where Ben comes from. But if Ben got in, you would say oh, my god, we have ourselves a problem.
But Ben Carson --
I will tell you that right now.
Here's what I'm saying. I'm not here to advocate for them.
People can put them in -- I have the ultimate temperament -- My temperament is great. You can't have a bad temperament and build a great company.
But all you do is attack those who disagree with you. You can't do that on the world stage.
Of course I do, because I have 90 days left. I want to win. I have 90 days left and I'm a different guy than Jeb Bush who said Marco is terrific, he's my dear, dear friend, he's such a wonderful person. You know what I said? Three months ago I said they hate each other. I turned out to be right. They hate each other.
No, no, listen. They both say they don't hate each other. They both say they are doing what you say you want to do. They want to win.
Excuse me, they hate each other. To be specific, they hate each other.
They both say they don't hate each other.
More than you will ever know how much they hate each other.
So you know better than they do, I guess.
Marco was extremely disloyal to Jeb Bush and everybody said Marco will never run because without Jeb, Marco would have never been where he is. And Marco, frankly, I mean, when he ran, it was shocking to people, especially to the people of Florida. It was shocking that he ran.
But here's what --
Because of the loyalty factor.
Here's the criticism. Here's the case that you need to make.
By the way, I think those people are right. He should have been more respectful to Jeb Bush.
I think that he actually got a lot of points in the debate because he was so respectful, that when there was this open attack, a naked attack by Bush about whether or not he goes and does the voting or not, how did Marco Rubio respond? With empathy, as a friend would. Certainly if had said that to you, he would have gotten a different response.
The problem is that Jeb is so weak in terms of his attack and his counterattack. There was no counterattack.
No, but I'm saying Marco Rubio didn't counter --
What Jeb should have done is he should have then refuted what Marco had said. Because Jeb had the better argument but he was a bad messenger.
Well, maybe. That's your take. What I'm saying is this.
That's not my take. That's everybody's take.
It's not everybody's take. You don't know what everybody's take is. You only know what you say.
He had a counterattack. He attacked him and that was fine. His message was not as badly delivered as people said.
Here's what I'm saying.
He attacked -- The problem was Marco then went on, talking about how wonderful it is that he didn't vote, which is wrong and other things. Jeb just stood there and didn't say anything.
Here's the point. You cannot effectively think that you're going to win to be president by just attacking the opponents all the time. It has to be what you're going to do, what is positive, how you will do it.
I've said what I'm going to do.
You say what you want to do --.
I'm going to renegotiate our trade deals where we're losing billions and trillions of dollars.
I know. But you have to do more. You have to say how you'll do it.
We're going to have the finest trade deals. Right now we're suckers for the rest the world. I'm going to start immediately with renegotiating our trade deals, I'm going to build up our military. I'm going to take care of our vets. I'm going to get rid of Obamacare and replace it with something much better --
That all sounds good but the devil is in the details.
I've said this 100 times. I mean, unfortunately, you have me followed by Sara Murray and she doesn't know what she's doing and she doesn't report what I say.
Listen. Mr. Trump, you have to stop insulting people who do their job.
Nor does she report the energy, to use another good word, nor does she report the energy in the room. She stands there like there's 12 people in the room.
She's a good reporter.
I get by far the biggest crowds.
You know she's a good reporter. You were nice to her yesterday when you saw her at your book signing. But now you use this tactic of attacking her.
I was nice to her until I saw her report the same night. She didn't even show the lines of people.
Oh, so what she didn't show the lines.? People know how many people were there. You tell everybody.
It stretched -- Excuse me. It stretched all the way down to Madison Avenue from the door. Three and four abreast.
I get it. We know that there were big crowds.
And you would have said there were three people standing there.
We get that there were big crowds. We cover it all the time. I get as much criticism for doing the interview with you, how I do it, as I do for having you on in the first place because they say you get so much attention.
Well I guarantee you this -- I doubt that. I guarantee you this, if there was nobody at the book signing, Sara Murray -- she would have covered it then she would have showed all the empty space --
I don't think you have a good case that the media is mean to you. I just don't think you have a good case. You get the most attention.
-- but instead of that, the place is packed and she gives a very inaccurate story. Now I don't know if that's because she's incompetent or she doesn't like me or maybe she's given instructions from up above.
Oh, please.
Who knows. I don't really care.
Listen, you know she's not getting instructions. You know you get the most attention.
I'm sure she's not. I'm sure, yeah. CNN is very straight, I'm sure.
You see now? You went from saying CNN is good, that we do a good job, now you're taking a shot at us. That's what I'm pointing out.
No, I'm complaining about the reporter that covers me. I think she's terrible. But that's fine.
All right. Let's talk about "Saturday Night Live". Let's change -- I can't have you going after Sara Murray. I'm going to have to come find you after this --
OK, you'll defend her later. I'm sure she'll defend herself in a very timid way.
She's doing a good job.
No, she's not. She's not reporting accurately. She's not reporting --
I'm telling you -- She is reporting accurately. You just don't like the reporting.
-- what happens in those rooms. I go into rooms have 4,000, 5,000, 6,000 people. When she reports it you'd think there were five people there. The people are going crazy. And they love -- We're going to make America great again. They go crazy and she stands there reporting, well, I'm here, never talks about the crowds. The crowd size. Usually she reports when everyone has left and she's standing in an empty room. That's not good reporting.
Mr. Trump, that's your perspective on it.
There has to be an agenda some place in CNN.
Listen, her agenda is truth just like the rest of us and when you don't like it you attack us and it works with your supporters, I get it.
OK, fine. Let somebody else have her.
All right. Let's talk about "Saturday Night Live". Let's end it on a funny note. So you're going there to do it. I was very surprised that they invited you because I thought you were at war with them, then all of a sudden they wanted to have you on. You say it's because of ratings.
You're never at war when you get great ratings with a network, OK? Nobody gets ratings like me. You think that you would have had 24 and 25 million people watching CNN and Fox --
No, I don't. I'll tell you what. I don't think the popularity is enough.
You think if Rubio was there -- If Rubio was there, you would have had two people watching.
I think that you help ratings, there's no question with it. I see it in my minute by minutes. It's one of the reasons that we get frustrated that you don't do everybody evenly. You like to go to the safe harbors where they give you a pass. You don't like to come on as much.
I like to go to places where they treat me fairly.
Do you think I treat you fairly?
I won't comment. Go ahead. I'm not talking about you -- by the way -- and I'm not talking about you, I'm talking about CNN.
All right. But I'm talking about me. I only do this one show.
I like to go to places where I get treated fairly.
Do I treat you fairly on NEW DAY?
I like you. And I like your treatment and I do think you're fair. But your other people, I can tell you, do not.
Ben Carson says that being president is a serious thing. Ben Carson says you shouldn't be joking around about becoming president. It's a serious endeavor. Should be treated seriously. That goes to your tone as well.
Well let me -- Can I respond to that? Ben Carson would have done it in two seconds if they asked him. But if they asked him, nobody would watch.
He says no.
So they wouldn't ask him. They are about ratings and current culture and they ask people. I saw that where Ben Carson said, oh, I'm too serious to do "Saturday Night Live". I'd never do it. I mean, give me a break. He would have done it in ten seconds and he wouldn't do probably 60 Minutes either because it's not serious enough. Ben Carson would have done "Saturday Night Live " in two seconds if they asked him. But they didn't ask him. They won't ask him, most likely. Maybe they will. Who knows. But they probably won't ask him because it is ratings driven. He's not going to get ratings. And frankly, if they asked him he would have done it in two seconds. So when I heard his statement about this is too serious, give me a break. He took a two-week tour of a book where he left the campaign in order to promote a book. So he'll leave the campaign in order to -- I mean, he announced I'm leaving the campaign to promote a book.
You have a book out, too. He said he was just modifying his schedule.
Give me break. He'll do that but he won't do "Saturday Night Live"? And if you look at "Saturday Night Live", probably every president we've had for many years has done "Saturday Night Live". So what Ben Carson said is a lot of bunk and you know it.
Well, I'll take your criticism on it.
No, you don't have to take my criticism. You know it's true also. Every single major politician in this country probably for 30 years has done "Saturday Night Live " -- if they're invited. If they're invited. But to do it you have to be invited. And to the best of my knowledge, Ben Carson has not been invited. And probably won't. But he would do it in two seconds.
I'm going to be watching the Twitter feed, Mr. Trump. Good luck in New Hampshire today.
OK. Very good. Thank you very much.
It's 41 past the hour. Joining us now, Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump. His new book "Crippled America: How to Make America Great Again", was released yesterday. Donald, good have you on the show this morning.
Good morning.
Donald, we just showed a poll, you were in first place ahead of Ben Carson. All is well with your world now and now I guess everybody is going to be calling you front-runner again because you're ahead in a poll.
Well, it was a strange thing because ABC/Washington Post did a poll and I was -- it was a great poll and I was way up, and nobody wanted to use it. And then other polls came out, they were good. And one poll came out from CBS and it was bigger than Benghazi. I mean, they covered it bigger than Benghazi. And I never really understood it, but that's the way the world of politics works, I guess.
How's your campaign going?
I was doing well but they took this one poll -- I think it was an outlier, but who knows. And they played it very big, I will tell you.
You know, the title of your book, not exactly an uplifting title.
No.
Yes, my mom saw you after the debate last week and convened a family meeting right after with two urgent messages, one, she said, you know, Oreos were now made in Mexico. We were traumatized as a family.
We don't eat them anymore, Nicolle.
Howard Dean. Howard Dean is actually the --
Hello. Hello, governor.
I have to; I've been wrong every time I've predicted you lost, so what am I going to do?
That's OK.
Have you back on the show.
I will say this, had Ben Carson been asked to do "Saturday Night Live", he would've done it in two seconds.
Yes.
That I can tell you.
That would be one heck of a show.
Yes, and you informed me very interestingly about the pyramids, I think I'll have to put that into my repertoire when I talk about Ben. That was a strange -- that was a strange deal. I learn a lot by watching your show, folks.
So you're going to send them all back?
With...
Right.
... but that's what happened.
Well -- well, when...
And...
... you -- when you...
And you can do it on a...
... talk about it...
And you can do it on a humane basis, you can do it on a basis where it works. And they come back. Good ones can come back but they have to go through a process. We have millions of people wanting to get into the country and they're doing it legally, and they're going through this long process and it's really unfair to them, also.
Right, and -- well, when you talk about it and particularly when you talk about it as it relates to trade and our relationships around the world, I mean you've been very clear. You're going to take jobs back from Japan, you're going to take jobs back from China, you're going to create jobs in America.
Right.
Right.
When they do, they're taxed to the hilt. I could give you numbers but I can't even believe them that they're so high. They call them tariffs, not taxes, OK?
... about all these companies...
Sure.
... that are taking their -- their acquiring companies overseas. But you don't like super-PACs.
No...
Because super-PACs...
Super-PACs are a...
... are evil...
... scam.
But you don't mind Carl Icahn's super-PAC on -- on -- on lobbying about...
No, I mean, look...
... this issue?
I -- if he wants to do it, fine. Right now, that's the law, Carl wants to do it. But you know, that's in a way a different thing. When a campaign is a super-PAC, like in -- in Iowa, Ben Carson's super-PAC is running his campaign. You're not allowed to do that.
Yes, yes.
You're not allowed to do that. He's running the -- they're running the campaign.
And -- and that...
And, by the way, they have total control -- you know, it's much different with Carl because he's going to do a super-PAC, he's talking about corporate inversions, he's right. You know when I mentioned, Maria, corporate inversions to the other candidates, they don't even know what I'm talking about.
They don't know that all of these companies are leaving the country to acquire other companies across the world...
Essentially, then don't.
... so that they can pay lower taxes?
Yes, essentially, they don't know. And if they do know, it's not like high on their list. It's not, you know, something they really care about.
Let...
It's hard to believe. With me, I go crazy.
It...
I'm -- I'm looking, I'm saying how can this happen. You look now with Pfizer what's going on, you look at all these companies, but we're losing -- we're going to lose a lot of money. And you know, one of the interesting things with corporate inversion is we have at least $2.5 trillion. You know, nobody really knows the amount of money over there but...
Right, it's unbelievable that we haven't been able to -- to -- to...
Unbelievable.
It -- you're right about that.
I haven't got...
I totally agree.
Yes, I haven't...
Yes?
I haven't found one person that disagrees, Democrat or Republican. I get along with everybody.
Well, let me tell you this, I asked Tim Geithner about this couple of years ago. He said we absolutely cannot change this because we're going to leave too much money on the table. That's what he said to me. That we need...
Well, we have to lower the tax and we have to simplify the process because, you know, when people want to bring money in, that they have to go through such bureaucracy and the tax...
Right.
... the tax. But it's not just the tax, it's the paperwork is unbelievable...
I know.
... with bureaucracy. And -- and the -- this strange thing I tell -- I use this as the example because this is one of the few cases where Republicans and Democrats agree and they -- they can't make a deal.
Yes.
It's unbelievable.
Let me get your reaction to these ads, Donald, because a political action committee called deportracism.com released this video, I know you saw it. It's canned using some harsh words against you. I'm going to play a brief clip, get your reaction.
OK.
But how are you going to do it? Can you get specific in terms of how you are going to get...
Yes, but I've been very specific, I've been very specific, look. We have to change our tax code, we have the highest taxes, we are highest taxed nation in the world.
So, let me ask you...
And your real -- your real unemployment number that you report brilliantly every week and every month, but your real unemployment number is probably 25 or 30 percent, Maria, it's not 5.2 percent.
Yeah, and talking about 5.1 percent for the month of October, and 180,000 jobs created.
It's a joke.
Right.
You know, they are in a workforce they want to work, many of those people want to look for jobs, when they stop looking, after months they stop looking, and they take them off, you know, from a statistical standpoint, they're employed.
Yeah. You going to...
So, if you -- when you report 5.2 and 5.1 percent, I don't laugh because it is so sad, but it is a ridiculous number. That was a number that was devised, and a methodology that was devised by politicians to make them look good.
Look, you are going to host "SNL" this weekend.
Right.
So, are you looking forward to it?
It's going to be great. Don't forget, that is just satire and we're having fun everybody understands that.
Right, right. But you tweet about Ben Carson this morning on these -- on the stories that he wrote about in his book.
I think it is a ridiculous situation, I mean, he is talking about pyramids were made from grain, and if you look at pyramids, they are solid -- they are solid other than the pyramids would not made -- but he is talking about that, but more importantly, he is talking about the fact that he wanted to use a hammer on -- or did or something, use hammer on mother's head, he stabbed somebody.
He said he almost stabbed somebody, he didn't stab anybody. He said...
No, no. He tried to stab it, and hit the belt buckle.
Donald, you have got the debate -- you have got the debate next week. How do you prepare for these debates?
Well, I guess I have been preparing all my life by talking to you many times, and by watching your show and watching other shows, and reading all of the newspapers, and going to the Wharton School Of Finance, and you know, doing a lot of different things, I mean it is really -- you know, it is sort of interesting when they say, how do you prepare for a debate? There are so many questions that ask.
Right.
You know -- you understand that.
So, do you want to -- then do you -- can you cut Defense budget?
No, no, no. I am not saying that. I am saying, if Russia wants to drop bombs on ISIS, I am al for it. These people that are so foolish, I am -- I am the most militaristic person have you ever had on your show, believe me, OK? And we are going to make our military strong.
Seriously, he has got incredible experience. He's got incredible experience. He's...
Why do you say that?
He's been on the Senate Foreign Relations...
I tell you -- look at great job we've done in Iraq, look -- with Lindsey Graham and the thinkers of -- our great thinkers, OK? Lindsey Graham has zero votes. He goes to South Carolina where from, I have 29 and he has 3. It's -- Lindsey Graham is totally discredited, as far as I am concerned.
Right.
And Russia wants Assad. We are giving all this money and all these weapons to so-called rebels. We have no idea who they are. Look what happened with Iraq, look what happened with Libya.
Unbelievable.
Hey, look, we're going to spend billions of dollars on bringing in -- I heard a number other day, the first time, 250,000 people from Syria.
Right.
That -- the migrants. And I have a big heart.
Yeah.
But we can't do it. We just cannot do it.
Donald, we've got -- yeah.
I do think -- I do think this. We should do a safe zone in Syria, help out with that. And let all the other countries help out, but this migrant situation, for us to take in 250,000 people...
Yeah.
We don't know where they are, it's crazy.
You guys should all... Yeh, you guys should all stick together on this little small ball dopey stuff.
Yeh, but I've been around a long time, they've been doing it to me for a long time. I'm pretty well vetted, I think. I mean maybe they'll find something I didn't know about.
They'll try, believe me.
Oh, they'll try, believe me.
Yeh.
And that's fine, that's fine. But, you know, if you think about what Carson's saying, he hit his mother over the head with a hammer...
No, he hit a friend. He almost did, but whatever....
He hit a friend in the face with a lock, he tried to kill somebody with a knife, and he said he suffers from pathological disease, OK? When you suffer from pathological disease, you're not really getting better unless you start taking lots of pills and things.
A kid, he was a kid.
Wellll..
You know, and he writes in the (contest)...
And then he went into a bathroom and all of a sudden he found religion.
He's a kid, right. And, and it, it's one of these stories where...
I'm surprised you're so gullible. I've never seen you like this.
It's not a matter of being gullible. I said quite clearly I have no blanking idea what happened, OK?
You know what's amazing to me, Bill? Here's a guy says the mother with a, a, you know, hit her with a hammer, all of these things...
But it doesn't matter. Don't you get that?
No, no. But he's trying to prove that he did it in order to have credibility. Who would want to prove this? I think, you know, I actually...
The story is redemption, that's what he's trying to get across.
No.
But be that as it may, the bigger story is...
Did you ever hit your mother?
No. Of course not.
I don't think so. And you didn't write that you hit her?
No.
There's something every strange here, something very strange is going on.
My point is that you and Carson, and every other Republican, when this kind of stuff happens, unsubstantiated, you should say, hey, it's small ball, we've got bigger things to deal with.
Well, I don't think it's small ball if you have somebody that admits that he suffers from pathological disease.
When he was 13!
I don't care. You don't get better, you don't get better. You know what makes you better? Pills make you better.
OK. So now you're Dr. Phil? Come on.
No, no. You don't get better. I mean you're not going to get better.
All right. Enough.
If it's in your stream, it's in your stream, Bill. I mean...
Enough, enough, enough.
You know...
ISIS.
...they talk about temperament. Do you think that's the right temperament to be President?
Look, he's...
I don't think so.
Everybody changes when their kids to adults. Now let's get to something serious. It looks like ISIS blew that plane up.
Bill, that's serious.
OK, not to me. It looks like ISIS blew that plane up in Egypt. The Russian plane.
It looked like that to me, yes.
You're, you're President Trump...
Right.
All right?
Yeh.
Now we have ISIS blowing airlines out of the sky. What do you do?
Well, first of all I'm very happy that Russia's bombing the hell out of them. And it was a Russian plane. There's no love lost there. So Russia, having somebody else working that is fine with me, unlike some people, they want to do it themselves. If Russia wants to do it, I think that's terrific. I would go after them...
So you want to subcontract ISIS out?
I would go after them so hard and so fast, and one of the things all of a sudden I hear other candidates saying what I've been saying for two years, for three years. Number one, we should have never been in Iraq, but we went there. Big mistake. The way we got out was wrong. I said to take the oil. With ISIS, they're making a fortune on oil. Bomb the hell out of the oil. You bomb the hell out of the oil.
But, see, that's in Iraq, all right?
Excuse me, I don't care where it is. Excuse me, excuse me.
You have to bomb the Iraqi oil fields.
I don't care where it is. What's Iraq? Iraq is a bunch of thieves that are running the government, sort of.
All right, OK. But let's deal with ISIS now and Syria.
Yeh, but Bill, you have to take away the money -- I'm dealing with ISIS. ISIS is making a fortune with oil.
So you stop their money flow?
And you know what? That's going to have a huge impact.
They will still try to blow airliners out of the sky. All right? You don't need a lot of money to do that.
No, you don't.
Are you going to send ground troops in?
And frankly that could really louse up the world because, if somebody's a flyer, I mean you have people who don't like flying to start off with, and they see that scene of that plane where obviously the back of the plane was blown to pieces, it's a real problem. You're going to have to do some really strong things to make sure that threat goes away.
All right, but what I'm trying to get at, would you send ground troops into Syria to try to get these ISIS thugs?
Well, I told you what I'd to. I'd knock out their source of wealth.
Right, yeh.
You can imagine, they're all tremendous. Why does he have to announce it? He goes out and he tells everybody, he has a news conference. We are sending 50...
He wants to look like he's doing something...
No, no, but you can't talk about it. Do you think General Patton talked? Do you think General Douglas MacArthur talked about...? They shot first and they talked later. Obama goes out and he say we are sending 50 of our finest men to Syria. There's a target on those 50 men. If he would have kept his mouth shut, which he should have, nobody would even know.
Right.
Number one. Number two, it has to be more than that.
Of course.
And you have to go in and you have to do the job. And if Russia wants to help, I think that's great.
All right. The book, you're look like a mean guy on the book.
Yeh, I, I, I did.
Really a mean guy.
I know, I know. You know it's the worst picture I've ever taken.
Yeh, why'd you put the mean guy look?
I'll tell you what happened.
Yeh.
The book is a very, very strong condemnation of what's gone wrong with our government.
But there's a lot of whining in the book, you know that, on your part?
No, no, and there's also a lot of let's fix it, and how to fix it.
All right.
And that's what important.
But why the mean guy look?
I can't have "Crippled America" with a big smile on my face.
All right. It frightened children. Children are frightened by it.
I know, they'll get used to it.
OK, now, Saturday Night Live. Did you knock out any of the bits? Do you say this is...
We're doing some bits that are, I think going to be terrific.
OK, but did you knock out any bits that they brought to you?
Yes, I had to. There were a couple that were too risque.
Too risque, wow!
Yes, too risque. Because, you know, the poll just came down. I'm leading in Iowa. I want to stay leading in Iowa. Does that make sense to you?
So they gave you veto power or knocking stuff out, huh?
Look, we all agree Lorne Michaels is terrific. He's a terrific guy. You like him, I like him, we all like him, he's very talented. And we sit down and we look at like 30 -- they have all these writers...
Yeh, they have a million writers.
They have a hundred writers. I walk into -- there are a hundred, and they're all about 17 years old, OK? They're all young. The whole thing is crazy. But they come up with many, many skits, and you pick the ones you think you like...
Right. Is this going to be funny? Is it worth staying up late?
I think some of it is going to be really great.
Right, yeh?
I think so.
Yeh? And you're not allowed to ad lib. You got to stay on script there.
They don't want you to (stray) because there's the cameras...
Yeh, they don't want you wandering around.
They don't want a lot of nonsense, yes.
OK, so you're happy about this, this "Saturday Night Live" thing?
Well, it's work. I'm leaving here, I'm going over there for some more time. It's work.
Yeh, rehearsal.
A little rehearsal. But, you know, it should be a great evening.
All right. We will see. Thank you for coming in.
Thank you very much.
We really appreciate you taking the time.
A great honor.
This hour in Closeup, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is in the studio for the first time in a while, to talk about the race for the white house, from the Iran nuclear deal to Republican debates. No shortage of topics to talk about. In a moment, one former Secretary of State campaigning for another former Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright in the presidential race and the crisis in Syria. Morning everyone, thanks for joining us I'm Josh McElveen, we heard it time and time, Donald Trump, he's gonna fade out after a while, eventually drop out. His support will erode, but it's November and that hasn't happened here in New Hampshire, in fact he stayed on top of the polls in the Granite state. But what are his specific ideas when it comes to the most pressing issues? He's our guest this morning, good to see you sir
Hi Josh
How do you negotiate with China? I mean you say you don't like --
They have all the cards
The question is, was Donald Trump surprised by that? Did he know it was Larry David or did he think it was a member of the audience shouting at him? We have Donald Trump on the phone right now to ask him. Are you there?
Hi, tucker, how are you?
How you doing?
Hello, everybody.
Yeah. Well the clips we've seen we think are hilarious and I love it, they brought Darrell Hammond back and it shows just the scope of how long Donald Trump has been around. But the reviews online have been mixed. Some people think that you weren't as funny as they expected and they like you better when you're out on the campaign trail doing your own thing. What do you say to that?
Well I think I'm honored by that. I like that better. If they would say they like me better in person than on some scripted show I think that's great. The reviews have been really good, I've been hearing good things. I mean, look, it's all in fun. And we had a terrific time. You know, the whole thing with the Hispanics is totally overblown. Very, very few people showed up last night. And they were gone before the show even started. You know why? You know what happened? They went home to watch the show. So that's what happened. I mean they were all gone before the show started which was nice, actually.
So the week's news towards the end of the day was dominated by Ben Carson and his biography and a couple different news organizations tracking down people who knew him in his youth and you had this kind of weird scenario, where Ben Carson trying to convince the media that he did, in fact, stab someone and did in fact go after his mother with a hammer. No other candidates in the race criticized him except you. Why are you the only one criticizing Ben Carson?
It's not criticizing. Look he's got to do his thing. I'm just saying, it's the first time in the history, in fact sort of -- they wanted to do a skit on it and I said let's not do that. It's not appropriate. But this is the first time in history where you want to prove that you hit your mother with a hammer, you want to prove that you hit a friend in the face with a lock, you want to prove that you tried to stab somebody to death in order to have credibility. This is in history, this is the first time, and, you know, it's a whole weird deal going on here. I don't know. I mean look, I hope everything is going to be OK for Ben. I've had a good relationship with Ben. I hope it works out. I hope this isn't going to be disqualifying, maybe it will, maybe it won't. Maybe the way it goes, who knows what's going to happen.
That's pretty big though, Donald Trump telling Lorain Michaels which skits to do and not to do. I saw you on Bill O'Reilly and you said you trumped them by saying some of them were too risqu when they were showing you the scripts for some of them --
They wanted to do something on this whole situation about Ben where, you know, when you're wanting to hit your mother with a hammer and all of this and you want to prove that it took place in order to keep credibility, and I said just leave it alone. You know what's going to happen. I would get blamed for it. Nobody else is gonna get blamed for it. Believe me. I will be the one to take the heat. I said let's just relax and go about our lives.
Mr. Trump, let's get to some of the big issues. Obviously there is a big Fox Business Network debate Tuesday with "The Wall Street Journal". You'll be there. That will be unscripted unlike last night as you say. We asked our viewers for questions. One from Joan in South Carolina. I would like to know how Mr. Trump feels about the rejected pipeline by the president? As you answer that can you be specific what you would do now that he's rejected the pipeline to actually create jobs.
Great question. I would absolutely approve it, but I would go back and renegotiate the deal as I would with virtually every deal made in the last many many years even beyond Obama. I would renegotiate the deal with the people wanting to put the pipeline in, I want a piece of the profits coming to the United States. We're making it feasible, we're making it practical, we're using imminent domain, which by the way you have you to use when you're doing a job like this or when you're doing a road or a highway or anything like this so we're giving them certain powers that they could never get without us. I would absolutely say, as a business guy, this is what I do, this is what I do really well, I would say, I want it, I like the jobs, environmentally it's better than having trucks running down our roads and spewing out fumes, it's better, but I would -- just don't forget, we're really pumping out fuel and energy from Canada, and I think that's great but I would want like 25% of the profits for the United States.
Yeah.
Nobody has asked for that and I'm sure it's the first time you've heard it and I'll tell you what's going to happen, everybody will hear this show because so many people listen, especially, you know, I mean they listen, and people are going to say, oh, gee, that's a good idea. The candidates will now take that idea and they will bring it forward as their idea. But the difference is, they won't be able to implement it. I will.
Here's the question from Daphne. If you're not elected president, with your negotiating skills, don't you agree you would be a great Secretary of State. Would you like to be the person running America's diplomacy.
I think I would, actually, be a good Secretary of State because I get along -- I have many, many deals all over the world. 17, 18 different countries, get along with prime ministers, get along with everybody.
Better than John Kerry?
In fact, I get along with Democrats and people say oh, you shouldn't get along, we have to go back to getting along, so executive orders aren't signed for everything. I don't know. Just wouldn't be me. I think it probably will -- I will go into the sunset and I will build my buildings and I will go to Scotland, turnberry and I'll go to Doral in Miami, and I'll go all over the place and keep doing what I've been doing for the last long period, which I love doing. The only reason I'm running is because I will make America great again and I don't see anybody else that can do that.
So you're saying, in your book, which I read last night, on the airplane, you said that we should destroy the oil production in parts of Syria and Iraq.
And grab it back -- by the way, we'll grab it back and we'll take it back. You have no idea how fast Exxon and these companies can bring it right back to health. But I mean hit it hard, Tucker. Hit it really hard. Take away the oil. They're making millions and millions of dollars a week and that's fueling all of this stuff that they're doing on the internet. You know they have better internet access than we do. They make us look like babies. They're recruiting people from our country and the worst is going to be when they recruit people from our country to stay in our country and do damage in our country. We have to take away their source of wealth fast and people are now using that expression and saying what I'm saying. Of course they don't mention my name, but that's OK. But people are now saying I was right.
All right. Donald Trump, we want to get your thoughts on something Hillary Clinton said in Orangeburg, South Carolina, yesterday. She wants to ease federal regulations on marijuana so that more research can be done, she says, on medical marijuana, as her reasoning behind it. What is Donald Trump's position on marijuana and the legalization?
I think it's a state by state issue, Anna. I think very strongly it's a state by state. It's in Colorado now and they're having certain questions about it. Is it having an impact on people's health, on brain powers, etcetera, so they really are having an issue. But let them look at that issue and others are looking at it as you know it was just rejected in Ohio, which was a ridiculous referendum because it gave one company a monopoly on the whole state which was crazy, but frankly, I think it's a state by state -- as far as medical marijuana, I would say that's something we should really consider strongly because people are sick and it does have a huge impact on a lot of people. And people have said it has a huge impact on the pain and suffering they have to go through.
Right.
So for medical that's one thing, but for the rest that should be state by state.
So -- so you'd step up the camp...
-- before the World Trade Center came down.
So he made -- you're saying he made the overture to you?
Yes, Lee asked me about it a long time ago. That's right.
A lot of talk about addiction on the campaign trail lately, especially up in New Hampshire.
Right.
But, you know, you used to think...
-- and we have to stop the source.
As you point out, you're going to be front and center to the debate Tuesday night. What do you expect?
Well, I think it's going to be more of the same. It's going to be questions. I think they'll be fair questions. It's a good group of people. Neil Cavuto's a great guy and the whole group and Maria's terrific and I think it will be very fair questions, unlike the catastrophe of the last deal.
Donald Trump, thanks for joining us this morning.
Thank you very much.
Yes.
... which is the oil. And I would hit them right now.
What -- when you say hitting ISIS hard, what do you mean specifically? Do you mean...
Well, I hate to say specifically, because, if I win -- you know, I'm leading in the polls. And, if I win, I hate to give all of my information right up front, to be honest with you.
All right.
So many people wanting to come into this country, Jake, and they're waiting in line. They're doing it legally. Very unfair.
So you don't believe him, do you?
Well, if you have pathological disease, that's a problem. I mean he wrote it. I didn't write it. But, you know, he's going to have to explain a lot of things away -- the scholarship situation, the dinner with Westmoreland when Westmoreland wasn't there, the pyramids. You know, a pyramid is a solid structure essentially, other than a little area for the pharaoh. And you don't put grain in a pyramid because it's all solid.
You know, you've done a little --
They have large structural beams in those days.
But let's see it. Show us your work.
And I've done that. As you know I've come out with a tax plan, very detailed. I've come out with a plan for the vets where we're going to make the vets happy and healthy. These are great people. We're going to take care of our vets.
So tariffs.
If somebody else builds it, it's going to cost $20 billion.
So Mexico pays for --
-- and that doesn't include the drugs that pour over into our country. That's exclusive of drugs, and the drugs are probably bigger than the numbers we're talking about.
So you're saying tariffs are going to pay for this.
No, I'm not saying that. No. I think Mexico -- I'll get Mexico to pay for it one way or the other. I guarantee that. And I have great relationships with Mexico -- the Mexican people I have great -- you're seeing in Nevada I won the poll with the Hispanics. But the leaders are taking advantage of our leaders because our leaders are not smart people. They're incompetent frankly.
Donald Trump, I believe we have a face-to-face coming up pretty soon. I know we're close to figuring it out. I look forward to it.
Very good.
Thank you.
Thank you, Chuck. So long.
Let me ask...
All I can say is, I hope it works out for him. I don't know what to think about it.
Let me ask you about the polls on the Republican side. You are in the pole position on the next debate, FOX News.
Right.
That means you're number one in those polls. But -- and you're ahead in a lot of the -- a lot of the states, but Ben Carson is...
All of the states.
So, you want to close the loopholes for tax havens? Is that...
And I want to bring back trillions of dollars that is stuck in other countries that we won't let back in because we don't have intelligent people running our country.
What about other loopholes on the personal side? Mortgage interest stays in there? Charitable giving?
That's right. Mortgage interest deduction would stay, absolutely.
Right.
And that's a pretty important thing, I think.
Donald!
Enrique!
It's the American people, sir.
What?
Let me...
It would have been good, I think, for viewers. I don't think it would have been good for me in terms of running for an election.
You're a racist.
Who is hell is -- oh, yes. I knew this was going to happen. Who is that?
Let me ask you about that...
We'll straighten it out. People -- and by the way, people will come into the country, but we're a country of laws. They'll come in legally.
You -- I read your book, which you just released. And you seemed to soften a hair where you maybe wanted to revise and extend your remarks somewhat when you said the vast majority of undocumented immigrants are honest, decent, hard-working people who came there to improve their lives, their children's lives.
True.
Well, let me ask you about it...
I think I would have done exactly what I'm doing.
Yes.
So I was a little bit surprised.
Let me...
So I don't think it was as much of a hiccup as you said.
How would you...
... gravitated toward that.
For example, I consider myself a Reagan conservative. I'm a registered conservative in New York, which you can do and you can't do in a lot of states. If you had to explain to somebody in just a few words, how do you describe yourself politically?
Well, I'm a conservative person. I would say that Republican Reagan conservative maybe would be another way of doing it. I was a big fan of Ronald Reagan. I thought a lot of him. And I would have to add the word Republican because I am. I'm a Republican. But I'm a Republican conservative. And we have to throw Reagan in there because, you know, I just -- I believed in him.
All right, Mr. Trump, thank you for your time. As always, we appreciate it.
Thank you very much.
All right, that was a great line. Joining us now from the Spin Room in Milwaukee is 2016 Republican Presidential front runner, Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, were you happy with the debate tonight? I thought it was extremely substantive.
I thought it was great. I thought the anchors really were -- the moderators were really elegant -- all three the way they presented themselves, the way they presented the questions. I thought it was a very elegant evening and very substantive, as you would say, yes.
You know -- there were differences on economic plans and immigration we just played. It was interesting to listen to Kasich and Jeb Bush going up kind of against you and Ted Cruz.
That's true.
And I thought Ted Cruz made a point if these were bankers crossing the border, if these were journalists crossing the border and driving down rates, I think the press might have a different point of view. I thought that was a strong point.
Well, we're on the same side of it. You know if you back to the early 1950s, Dwight Eisenhower, and I made that point during the debate, he took out in terms of illegal immigration, he felt you had to do it. He was a nice man, a high quality man, but he moved out 1.5 million people and brought them back to where they came from. They were here illegally. I think -- it really does have big precedent. We either have a country or we don't, Sean. We have a country, we have to have borders, we have borders, and we have to have laws. We either have a country or we don't. It's that simple.
Mr. Trump, it seems like nobody talks about this aspect of it, too, the economic impact in terms of people that now have to compete for jobs, it drives down wages, but more importantly, how much is this costing our country in terms of our educational system, our criminal justice system, our health care system, we're talking about billions and billions of dollars because people don't respect our laws and sovereignty.
Sean, I've heard the number is $250 billion a year, illegal immigration, and frankly, it's an expensive proposition, moving and everything else, but you are talking about tremendous amounts of money that we spend, not to mention other things, for instance, when you look at the crime and other elements that happen that are also very bad. So we're talking about 250 billion dollars a year, that's a lot of money for a country that owes $19 trillion.
I agree with you repatriating that money, that's going to bring trillions of dollars back, the energy specter if we become energy independent. That's a big component. I would also -- what would your corporate tax rate be if America becomes the corporate tax haven of the world, then all of these multi-national companies will want to headquarter right here.
We're going to have a 15 percent corporate tax rate, and that's getting to be on the low side. Right now, we're the highest taxed anywhere in the world and we're going to be on the low side. There will be a couple of countries lower but not many. So we're taking it from the highest in the world to being on the very low side.
You know we paid for the liberation of all these countries and they don't ever give us a dime. I thought that was a very powerful moment in the debate for you.
They give us nothing. And that's because we have people that don't know what they're doing. Sean, they give us nothing. You are one of the few people willing to say it. But we have people that don't have a clue, and we should have had that. You know I've been saying on your show for three years, you have to lead, keep the oil. We shouldn't have been in there in the first place. They destabilized the whole Middle East. Once you are in, you leave and keep the oil. So now who has the oil? ISIS has it, Iran has it. We don't have it. We have nothing.
You know I was interested in a couple of other things you said tonight. And I agree with this point, too. If Vladimir Putin, now that we in all likelihood, he had a Russian airliner shot out of the sky by ISIS, if he wants to take out ISIS, let him do it.
I've been saying it for two months. If he wants to do it -- so now, he's not in love with ISIS. He doesn't want them coming into Russia, believe me. But now on top of it he had an airplane blown out, he really doesn't like -- if he doesn't like them and wants to go after ISIS, Sean, I think that's just great.
I'm interested, do you agree with the idea of the separate refugee camps maybe within Syria where we provide humanitarian assistance, medical supplies, food and water, rather than people migrating to Europe or coming to the United States and also protected military. Is that something you support?
It's called a safe zone. They take a big piece of land -- a big swatch in Syria and you get all the countries like Germany and others that are ruining themselves, they're ruining Germany. It's hard to believe she's allowing that to happen. You create a big safe zone and take care of the people until they can ultimately go back. That's better. Can you imagine us taking 250,000? President Obama wants to bring 200 to 250,000 people in, and he doesn't even know where they come from. They don't have papers. We don't know who they are. So we can't do that. It would cost millions of dollars.
And James Clapper said ISIS and Al Qaeda will infiltrate the refugee community.
Absolutely. Absolutely, it will happen.
I did like the moment -- tonight, I thought you were very gracious, you said, will you please let Jeb Bush speak?
I meant it. He was cut off. I meant it actually.
I know you did. I'm just -- it was just an interesting side note. Last question, 5600 pages, TPP, nobody read Obamacare, they pass these bills all the time this way. Should there be a limit on the number of page a bill is before we pass these things considering? I think Ted Cruz made the point its more pages than the bible and less meaning than any one page.
Almost 6,000 pages, nobody's read it. We have no idea what we're doing, there are no currency manipulation clauses there. China's going to come in the back door, everyone's laughing at us. I am the one that brought it up tonight, 6,000 pages and nobody has even read it. We truly don't know what we're doing. It should not be passed?
All right, Mr. Trump thanks so much for being with us. Appreciate your time as well.
Thank you, Sean.
Donald.
Hi, everybody.
Let's get this straight. You were there last night and flew straight here. How many hours sleep did you get?
Not too much. About an hour and a half.
About an hour and a half. So you're rested and ready to go.
What I do for you folks.
Oh, OK.
That's all right. That's right.
Let's dive in on the debate last night. How do you think the debate went?
I thought it was great. I thought the moderators were fantastic. You go from that to what we had a few weeks ago which wasn't good talking about football, fantasy football. I thought the three moderators did a fantastic job. Not only really a good job, it was elegant. It was an elegant debate. Now I don't know if that's going to be as big as it would have been, let's say No. 1, we had 24, 25 million people for No. 1 and I would think that over a period of time maybe just naturally it goes down but they were terrific moderators last night.
Who, other than yourself, who do you think had the best performance?
I don't think anybody did poorly really. I really don't.
The quality seems --
Normally I should say they were all terrible, everybody, right? They were horrible.
How did Ben Carson do?
I thought he was good. They didn't ask him that many questions. He didn't have a lot of air time, but I thought he was good. He was right next to me. I thought he was good.
I'm curious. You were very critical of Ben Carson on the campaign trail last week, went after him. But last night seemed to keep the gloves off. Why is that?
I don't want to be critical. I like him to start off with. I do. I like him. I don't want to be critical. Last night they were asking questions. Ben and I have gotten along very well over the period of time. I've actually become friends with a lot of the people that are up there. Some very good people up there actually.
Is Ben Carson qualified to be president of the United States?
Well, I don't want to say, Joe -- That's not for me to say. You know, look --
Would you let him run one of your companies?
I would let him operate on a friend of mine, not necessarily me, but a friend of mine.
But would you let him run one of your companies?
Sure, if you're talking about a company, sure.
You would never let him run one of your companies.
I didn't say -- You are really critical.
Really?
She was fantastic.
OK.
But on one of the --
I thought I was the only one.
She was so positive about my performance last night, so it was great.
But you say that the United States should not be the world's policemen.
No. Joe, we owe $19 trillion.
Does that put you in line where Barack Obama is as far as leading from behind?
No, I think I'm a little bit more on the let's go side than that. But at the same time, I love the fact that Putin is bombing the hell out of somebody and the people that he's bombing right now have to be ISIS to a certain extent. They just probably just blew up his airplane. That was a Russian plane and it went down and I assume it was a bomb. I think they don't want to say it. But it looks like it was a bomb. And having Putin dropping bombs on ISIS is a very positive thing. We don't have to do 100 percent of the bombing.
Singapore.
Anywhere. I can name 20 different places and then you land at LaGuardia and you have potholes in the runway. The place is falling apart.
Listen. When it comes to the infrastructure we have that's falling apart. There's so much that needs to be done here and last night I heard you say you would keep the minimum wage as is, you would not raise it. Explain how that is necessary.
It's a very tough thing.
Because $7.50 an hour, Donald, nobody can live on that and there are people living on that.
Mika, we're becoming a noncompetitive country. That's the problem. We're becoming noncompetitive. I would love to say make it $50 an hour, I think it's great --
I understand you can't do that.
And you know what? It's a tough position politically. The best thing for me to say, I'm running for all of a sudden for the last four months, first time in my life I'm a politician. I can't believe this. I'm a politician. I never respected politicians. Now I'm a politician.
But Donald, do you have people working for you making $7.50 an hour? No.
Yeah, probably, maybe I do somewhere along the line. I got thousands of people. But you know what? We have to become competitive with the world. Our taxes are too high, our wages are too high. Everything is too high. We have to compete with other countries and if we're going to just say hey, I just seen in New York where they made it $15, well you're going to --
Our wages are not -- I mean, you can argue our wages are flat.
Listen to this. What's going to happen is now people are going to start firing people because they're going to -- You know, the old story. It's happened a hundred times. It's always happening. But I'm not even saying from that standpoint, Mika. We have got to do something to compete with the rest of the world. Our country is not competitive anymore. That's why we're losing all of the manufactures. Now, it's currency manipulation and all of those things that I talked about last night. A lot of currency manipulation. They're going it brilliantly in China. China is a tremendous abuser of the United States. I said the other day, in the history of the world there has never been a greater theft than what the United States has, you know, we've been taken care of by China. China has -- it's one of the great bank robberies of all time.
Explain that.
Well China has manipulated their currency, taken our jobs, our base, our manufacturing. They've taken so much out of us. Hundreds of thousands of companies. We have lost hundreds of thousands of companies and millions and millions of jobs.
But isn't that better, though, for the consumers that, yes, maybe China can build something cheaper? But it comes back to us at the end of the day where we --
You know what? It's better for China, not better for us. We're losing our jobs, we're losing everything. We're losing our manufacturing, our base, we're losing everything. Now, we can change it.
So you've ridiculed --
I will take care of that better than anybody.
-- trade deals that the Obama administration has made. Are there any good deals that this administration --
Not too many.
OK. Can you name one?
I can name one. Look at the Iran deal. Maybe the worst deal I've ever seen negotiated of any kind and I'm not talking about between countries. Maybe the worst deal I've seen negotiated. The Iran deal, they get 150 billion, they get everything they wanted. We caved point after point after point -- We don't even get our prisoners back.
But what do you do on day one if you're president of the United States? You've said before Obama has made the deal, Trump has to live with the deal.
The biggest problem with the deal is they're getting now the 150 billion -- I can't get it back. No matter how good I do, the money will be gone. I hate that the money is gone. I've always liked money. I hate that the money is gone. $150 billion will be gone. So hopefully when I get there, oh, I'll do such a good job, Mika. You'll be so proud of me.
Really?
But the money is gone.
OK. So let's talk about money. You have talked about using United States laws to further your business. You've used bankruptcy laws and often to your benefit. What happened to those investors after you filed for bankruptcy? You were --
Wait, wait, wait. Let's go back. Every major person that you've had on this thing in terms of business has done the same things.
So let's -- Also, some major companies, whether it's Delta or other companies that have done the same thing. Let's talk about --
When you take a look at Atlantic City, almost everybody is in bankruptcy in Atlantic City. Caesar's just filed for bankruptcy. Who would think Caesar's? But Caesar's just filed for bankruptcy.
Thousands of jobs.
Yeah, Leon Black, you know smart guy. But Caesar's just filed for bankruptcy. Many, many top business people, and I mean the top. And we do it because it's good.
They did the skit on "Saturday Night Live"
Did you see that? Where the president of Mexico walks in, I have a check --
And how exactly do you do that?
They gave me a $20 billion check even though it's going to cost 7. I said it's too much, Enrique. It's too much. No, no, no.
So how exactly -- We'll get to "SNL" in a little bit -- How exactly do you get Mexico to pay for the wall?
It's so easy. I just told you -- trade imbalance of between 45 and 55 billion dollars. They're also -- you're talking about, you know, they were going to spend $12 billion on the wall. I'm going to spend seven or it's going to be bigger, better and nicer. I know how to build, OK?
But -- OK.
But Mexico has got to pay. When you're losing -- we give billions of dollars to Mexico. Billions. You need the wall. You need it because -- and by the way, walls do work. All you have to do is call up Israel and say how's your wall working? 99 percent.
How do you deport 12 million? How do you deport 12 million illegal immigrants?
You do it. You do it. Because they're here illegally, you do it. Now remember this. In 1952 Dwight Eisenhower, who was a nice man, right, I mean, whether people like him, don't like him, people thought of him as -- remember the expression, "I like Ike " -- like mine's "Make America great again." I still like that one better. We could go "I like Donald " but it doesn't work, right? But "I like Ike." That was his expression. Dwight Eisenhower sent millions of people -- a million and a half at a minimum people out, illegal immigrants. He sent them out. And by the way, brought them out, brought them to the border, let them go, they came back. Let them go again, they came back. Let them go a third time, they came back. The fourth time he moved them all the way south, then they came back again.
So we're going to dig deeper on that after a break. Just to close out, I have a question for you. The new prime minister of Canada has pledged to hire 50 percent women -- 15 men, 15 women in his cabinet. And he was asked why and he said because it's 2015. Will you make a similar pledge? Will you have women in your cabinet?
Well, I think you know a lot about my accompany. And --
I do.
-- I have many, many women in my company.
I know.
Probably more than almost anybody proportionally. It's just about 50 percent, might even be more than 50 percent. So I'm not one that has to make a pledge, and I wouldn't want that, because I will tell you, I want the best person at each position. OK? And I think you'd want to hear that. I want to get the best. Carl Icahn endorse me. I'm going to get Carl involved in China. Carl's a great business man. I'm going to say, Carl, watch our trade deal. It stinks with China. All of a sudden we're going to say, wow, you know, things are getting really good with China. I'm going to get the best people for the job.
OK, our conversation here in Manchester, New Hampshire continues with Donald Trump. And, Donald, to Jeb's point there politically as well in terms of where we are as a country, I mean, you talked about Ike and you talked about the possibility of moving a large number of people. I'd like to dig deeper in the how here. We have racial tensions in this country. We do represent something about ourselves that's different than around the world. Did he have a point there and how exactly would you send these people back home? Physically how?
Everybody has a point. Look, we have to do what we have to do, and Ike did it and other people have done it. And in Mexico, you want to go into Mexico, you're not outta there, you get thrown out. I had friends that were there the other day, they stayed -- they overstayed by a day. They knocked on the door by the police, but you're over by a day. By the way, that's the way a country is suppose to be run. Whether you like it or not.
So people will face ramifications that they don't leave, if they harbor them --
Will people will leave.
How are you going to pay for this?
Very inexpensively.
How do you unify the party though? And get everybody together?
One of the reasons --
How do you unify the party if -- you've said some very tough things about Jeb Bush, about Marco Rubio, about Ben Carson. How do you then --
Did I stick up for Jeb last night? He couldn't talk; they wouldn't let him talk. I said let Jeb talk.
He really appreciated that.
Was that a nice thing?
Yes, he really -- why didn't you --
Somebody said I only said that with Carly. That's false. I said it with Kasich, because -- who's also a nice guy. You know, honestly --
It was about finding his faith.
No, I know. I know. But they're pretty severe. I never went after my mother with a hammer, that I can tell you. And if I did, I was in big trouble. I was in big trouble. hit anyone in the head with a hammer. If I did, I was in big trouble. No, it was the whole thing. Ben understands. He wrote about it. I'm not telling anything new. But I thought it was sort of a strange situation.
Donald, last night you and the others on the stage spoke about issues of global importance about the future of this country and the future of our role in the world. For too many families in this state and in other states, the future is like this afternoon due to the drug crisis in New Hampshire and otherwise heroine, an overflow of heroine.
Heroine in particular.
Drug treatment facilities.
You have to. It's not like would I be willing to?
Mental health.
They have such a problem here. It's incredible. And I don't know what it is. New Hampshire seems to have a bigger problem than other places. But -- because you go to other places, they don't talk about it. Up here, I think it's maybe the No. 1 question I get is the heroine.
I would like to broaden this out a little bit. The three of us -- five of us, actually -- were in Wichita last week and we were sitting down with people -- the Koch brothers network -- about criminal justice reform. And the underlying premise of it was that we need to rethink our concepts of the drug wars, incarceration, we need to rehab people in prison facilities. I'm wondering, you know, you are a tough on crime guy. You have been a tough on crime guy. Notably in the '80s and '90s. Have you had an evolution like a lot of the country has on this? Have you rethought some of you positions on this at all?
No.
No?
I'm tough on crime.
Zero Tolerance.
-- being tough on crime. I really am. I'm tough on crime and we have to stop crime. You look at what's going on in the inner cities right now, it's unbelievable where you go to places like Chicago. And it's all in one little section and it's -- but boy, it's like the wild West.
Donald, today is Veterans Day. And if you live in northern New Hampshire or western Iowa or real rural places, it could take you hours in a car to get to a VA facility to be treated. Would you be in favor of implementing a program beneath the umbrella of the VA where local veterans could go to a doctor or a hospital nearest to where they live, get treated and the federal government would pick up the tab?
Totally. Now I came out with a plan last week --
Yeah, no --
This is true. Should I say?
It was really big.
Should I say?
Please.
She hit one shot, it was over a lake and it has rocks in the lake, it's this beautiful lake, and it was the worst shot that you'll ever see it, right?
Well, if they're lucky --
I would tell them that.
You said it is a beautiful thing to watch the candidates dropping out one by one. With this debates in the books, time to go to more hardball against the other candidates, Ben Carson and the others?
Well, I think that it is going so well, and to be honest with you, I loved the debate last night. We got high marks on the debate, and I was very happy with the way it worked out. Every single poll, and the underlying poll, Drudge and everyone else had me winning the debate last night, but I don't know it is up to them if they want to drop out, they can drop out, but it has nothing to do with me, but I think that you will be seeing people dropping out.
Who is next?
I don't want to predict. I think that I know, but I don't want to predict. I mean a lot of people have to dropout, because they are not resonating, and they are very good people, but if you don't resonate, you have to drop out.
And in the background, it needs to be stronger?
No, you were nice to me this morning and said it was elegant and everything else.
And conciliatory.
Maybe I have to do that. Maybe that is the way I'm supposed to be.
Debates only or on the campaign trail?
No, no, not in the speeches, because people would be disappointed if I was that way. But during a speech, it is different, and during the debate, you have to give other people the chance to talk. In the case of Carly, she was interrupting a lot of people. And by the way, four people came up to me afterwards on the stage, and they say, thank you for what you did with Carly. I think that she is a nice person, no problem with Carly. But if you remember, I did the same thing with Kasich, because he was cutting off Jeb Bush. And I said, "Let Jeb speak."
Now for the top story tonight: joining us from his headquarters here in New York City Donald Trump, author of the big new book "Crippled America: How to make America great again". I think the book is about America. First of all --
It's about America.
-- some clarification, I need some stuff clarified tonight. Do you know Putin personally? Do you know him?
No, I don't. I was on "60 Minutes" with him four weeks ago. I didn't shoot it at the same time. They did him and then they did me.
They did you in different segments. So you never met him?
And it was a very successful show. No, no -- I didn't meet him. No, but they had us on together. I call us stable mates but we never met.
All right. So you would try to win him over and make him your friend. Maybe give him a golf membership --
I'll give it a shot.
-- to Doonbeg in Ireland. He can hit a few balls around, you know, something like that. Now, you remember President Bush, the younger, saying that he looked into Putin's soul and saw a good guy or something like that. You remember that right?
I have heard that, yes.
Ok. And then Putin turns around and he hoses the U.S.A. whenever he gets a chance. I'm not sure this is a friendly guy.
Well, that's because he is given the opportunity.
Well still --
That's because he's given the opportunity. I mean, the people we have that represent us don't know what they are doing. So he has that opportunity, why wouldn't he do it? I would do that too to whoever I'm dealing with.
All right. But all indications are that he is a gangster and the capitalism over there is a fraud --
He's a tough guy. Bill.
Yes. But it's more than that.
He is a tough guy.
Now, he deported, as you rightly pointed out, about a million, maybe a little bit more illegal aliens back in the early 1950s. Do you know what the program was called?
Now they think it's 2.2 million.
All right -- whatever it might have been. Do you know what the program was called?
I do, but I wouldn't use the term. I don't like the term.
-- no, no.
-- good reports, I've heard bad reports.
You know me.
We would do it in a very humane way. And Bill let me tell you, Truman also sent 3.5 million people out. So you have to check on that. But Truman, before Ike, sent 3.5 million people out.
It doesn't matter.
The people are here illegally.
The Supreme Court would absolutely rule they all have to have due process because they are on American soil -- you know that.
Do you remember when you said about the anchor babies that there is nothing you can do about it and I said yes, there is?
Right.
I was right about it.
No, you weren't.
And frankly all we need is a simple -- yes, I was. You don't need a new amendment. All we have to do is go back to Congress and have a rather -- it's been fully vetted now, bill. I was right on the anchor babies.
The courts have ruled twice against the anchor baby stuff. You'd have to get a constitutional amendment passed to overturn that. You might be able to do it. You don't have to but you just --
You don't have to do a constitutional amendment.
All right. This goes around and around.
You need an act of Congress. I'm telling you -- you need an act of Congress. Everybody thought you needed a constitutional amendment.
You could change the law -- absolutely.
You don't need that.
All right. Ok. Who do you think right now at this point in history is your main challenger among the Republican candidates?
I think they are all challengers.
Ok. But I don't think you are the one that's being attacked for a guy who couldn't understand a thing. That's more Carson. Nobody with credibility is saying, look, Trump couldn't handle the work. I didn't hear that but I think Cruz is --
I can handle it -- believe me I can handle it.
And maybe some time Vlad Putin will join you right on the stage and you guys can go bowling. Everybody will be friends. It will be great.
And you will be the first one to cover it. I guarantee you that.
You put it on the table. And now, of course, you were criticized heavily at debate, right, Kasich, Jeb Bush, saying that your proposal --
Well, they are weak people. Excuse me, they are weak people. I watched Jeb today. They are weak people. And Kasich has made a fool of himself in the debate.
The question I'm asking, though, is how do you take 11 million people and make them move?
You do it through a process. You do it in a very humane manner.
But they don't want to leave, you have to hire people to find them and get them --
First of all, they are here illegally. If a person comes across the border and you send them right back, the border patrol sends them right back. There isn't a big court situation to send them back.
But they pay in taxes --
Who pays in taxes? Do you believe --?
They pay Social Security, state and local.
Yes, what percentage of them, ten percent?
It's 24 billion a year --
Excuse me. Excuse me. Do you know how few pay taxes, Erin? Don't be naive. Do you think that an illegal immigrant, getting money is going to be paying taxes?
Joining me right now on the telephone is Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump himself. Donald Trump, good to have you on the program. Welcome back.
Good morning.
You know, I really liked that comment, that striking oil in Ohio in reaction to John Kasich. But let's talk about your immigration plan for a moment, Donald. Is it realistic to just send all those people back? How are you going to do it? Won't that be a disruption?
Everything is a disruption. It is a disruption having a lot of our jobs taken by people. Frankly you know when you have 100 million people in our workforce and many of them can't find work. You know the 5.2 that you report about all the time, that is a fictitious number, you understand that, Maria, I mean I am sure everybody understands that. 5.2. That was devised, that system was devised by politicians, presidential politicians mostly so they look good. And this way you know here we have a thing where I go out to -- every time I go out I have 5, 6, 7,000 people in auditoriums and all and they're not going to be there if it was 5.2 percent, OK? They're there because it's probably 22 or 25 percent unemployment.
Right.
And, you know, we're talking about a lot of things with illegal immigration. No. 1, it is illegal. We don't have borders, we don't have any controls, and I'll tell you what. I get my biggest standing ovations when I go out to different places -- we're going to Texas this week, we're going to -- I mean every arena is sold out with thousands and thousands of people -- when I say I am going to build a wall and I am going to you know create a border. We're going to create an actual border because right now we don't have one. And I get my biggest ovations when I talk about the wall. But a real wall, not the little walls that you see now where they walk across them -- five feet tall and a couple of pieces of wire. They cut them, they drive trucks right through or they build ramps and good right over the walls. It's unbelievable.
I mean, look, you're all about jobs.
And you know, Mexico -- And this is not about Mexico, by the way. This is about many countries. But Mexico is the hardest country just about in the world to become a citizen in. So people go right through Mexico and they come into our country and Mexico helps them. You know trains, everything, you see the trains. It's unbelievable, actually.
And I think that is why you are resonating so much with the American people because you are linking everything back to jobs for Americans. I want to bring up this op-ed in "The Journal " today, Donald, because it is an opinion, and it says --
It's so wrong.
Republican fault line.
Yeah. You were there, you heard what I said.
Thank you.
But we will talk about that in a second. But The Wall Street Journal writes an editorial where I said -- that Donald Trump didn't know that China wasn't in the deal -- Well, I know that China is not in the deal. And if they look at speeches they will see I talk about it all the time, this deal is going to be a great deal for China. It is going to be unbelievable because China is going to come in through the backdoor and that is what I said. They are going to come in later through the backdoor and they will take advantage of what all of these other people were negotiating and The Wall Street Journal does a big editorial that I didn't know about China. You were there, you heard me say it.
Right. They're --
You heard me say it.
They're suggesting that you -- Yeah, well you talking about the TPP deal being a bad deal --
I am suggesting that The Wall Street Journal editorial board doesn't know what they are taking about, that they are third rate, they got the story, which was incorrectly reported, in another publication, that publication has since changed the story because they now say oops they made a mistake. The Wall Street Journal read another publication, they got the story from the other publication, and they did an editorial about it and they didn't call me and -- All they had to do was call me and say, oh, but you said -- I said no, just go back and see the debate. I wouldn't even have to comment on it. There is no clarification because I was totally accurate at the debate. I think you remember when I said China is going to come in through the backdoor; is that right? You know --
Yes, no, I -- I definitely remember you saying that China --
In fact, Rand Paul --
-- is the bad guy here -- is the bad guy here. But we were talking about TPP. So they are suggesting that you didn't realize that China was not even part of the TPP. But the whole criticism here of the TPP is that at some point, if we don't do something with other about Asia-Pacific nations that China is going to do a deal with those Asia-Pacific nations and then America is out of it.
Right. Right.
So that's partly the criticism, that America gets out of this because --
Well, no, my only criticism --
And that is why China is not in it, by the way.
Look -- Right. By the way, and that's another reason that China is not in. I mean you know that and I know that. But why would they write that I thought that China was in the TPP because they don't know what they are talking about. They write so many bad editorials. Whoever the editorial board top person is -- and I think I actually know who the top person is -- they ought to resign because they are incompetent.
You said you are a free trader one hundred percent.
I am a free trader --
And yet you --
No, no but -- Free trade --
But you also did say you --
-- with competent deals.
And you could only be 49 percent. You got to go into joint venture and you can only own 49 percent.
Absolutely. And look at Boeing. Boeing just made a deal to sell 300 airplanes and China is making them build massive plants in China, OK, massive plants. Boeing is going to build a lot of their planes out of China now because China is forcing them to do it. Look, I believe in free trade. But we are being ripped off by all of these countries that are -- have much smarter people than we do in terms of the negotiators. That's why Carl Icahn came out and endorsed me. You saw that. Carl endorsed me. I don't know if Carl endorses anybody. I mean, who does Carl endorse?
You're right. No -- he's spoken very highly of you and your plans --
Well because he knows I'm smart.
Let me switch gears, Donald.
Maria, he knows I'm smart.
And he's a business guy. And -- he is a business guy.
And he knows I understand and he hates to see what is happening, and Carl is very big into corporate inversions where companies are moving out of the United States and also companies can't bring money their money back in.
Well we are about to lose Pfizer.
What?
We're about to lose Pfizer, the tenth largest company in America, Pfizer --
Oh, you're going to lose many companies if --
Right. We'll they've double taxed. I mean -- let me stay on the tax story because you've been very clear --
Well they're double taxed and they're taxed too high.
Right, I know that. Yeah, I mean it's unbelievable how long we have been talking about tax reform -- can't get it done. Real quick, Donald, what is your take on this whole Missouri story protest? It's really taking a troubling turn.
I think it is disgusting. I think the two people that resigned are weak, ineffective people. I think that when they resigned they set something in motion that's going to be a disaster for the next long period of time. They were weak ineffective people. How we hire people like this -- Trump should have been the chancellor of that university. Believe me, there would have been no resignation.
Yeah. Real quick, before you go, I you know got to jump -- Donald, you know the FBI is expanding this investigation of Hillary Clinton emails. I thought one thing was for sure the other night. It seems like the candidates now are turning now to target of Hillary. I mean, we know she is going to be front-runner. Any thoughts on the FBI investigation into her emails?
Well, I have a lot of thoughts. I think she is being protected by the Democrats because many people are in jail right now for doing 5 percent of what she did. She is being protected by the Democrats, by the prosecutors, and possibly by the FBI. And that is just not what I hear about them. I am so disappointed in them. But possibly. And look --
Donald, it was great to --
What she did is a crime. She broke the law one hundred percent. In many different ways, she broke the law. She is being protected one hundred percent by the prosecutors and probably almost definitely by the president. He said don't prosecute her. And that is what happened.
I really enjoyed the debate the other night, Donald, because I think that we got to real substantial issues. I am getting commentary from CEOs everywhere telling me thank you, thank you for soliciting real information. So thank you, thank you for that debate.
Well you -- you and the group, the three of you, were so outstanding and I've told people -- and you know the word I used? It's a strange word to use. I said they were really great. It was elegant. You were elegant. All three -- I mean, you -- it was an elegant -- and especially after the whole thing with the -- the football questions, right, and it was so ridiculous, the previous debate. So -- fantasy football.
Thank you.
But you were elegant and it was a great job by the three of you.
Go figure we have so many things.
You should be very proud of yourselves.
I appreciate you saying that very much, Donald. Have a great day and thanks so much for joining us this morning.
Thanks, Maria. You take care of yourself. Bye.
Let's talk more about the immigration issue and the Republican presidential race with businessman and GOP presidential candidate, Donald Trump, who is also the author of the new book "Crippled America: how to make America great again" coming to us from Trump Tower in New York. Mr. Trump -- thanks for being here.
Hello, Bret.
Let me ask you about something else you said. Back in 2012, you criticized Mitt Romney's proposed self-deportation because you said it was crazy and too mean-spirited. So is self-deportation really crazy and too mean-spirited when compared to deportation?
No. I said it was crazy, because it doesn't work. He was talking about people are just going to walk out of the country. I didn't say that.
But mean-spirited?
I said -- I criticized it because it's something that doesn't work. Yes, it's mean-spirited, it's mean-spirited. This doesn't work at all, Bret. This would never have worked. Look, I want people to go out and to have to come in through the legal process.
One of your opponents, Ted Cruz, said today he now opposes any increases in legal immigration numbers. And that's a reversal of his earlier position. So do you think legal immigration should be restricted further?
I think that legal immigration is a good thing. If they come in legally, they go through a process, and if they come in legally, I think that's a good thing -- Bret.
A piece for the country.
I want a piece of the deal for the -- yes for the country. Not for myself.
Are there other foreign companies operating in the U.S. that you want a piece of their deal?
It's different. They were here a long time ago. These people are starting right now. In fact, it's even worse because Obama turned them down. Now, I would turn them up. I would say absolutely but we want 25 percent of your profits if I'm going to approve the deal.
In the debate you said wages are too high. What do you say to somebody in South Carolina where the median per capita income is only about $24,000 and wages are stagnant and costs are going up?
I didn't say that. Bret, we were talking about the minimum wage.
Mr. Trump -- thanks as always for the time and we'll see you on the trail.
Thank you very much.
Donald, thank you very much for meeting with me.
Thank you.
All right. You are at the top of the national polls right now. You have held that place for months and months now. In the debates on the campaign trail, though, there's been a little bit different of a Donald Trump. Dare I say more conciliatory, nicer.
Isn't that a good thing?
Are we going to see more of this?
Well, I don't know. I mean, I'm the conciliatory person. I'm a nice person. I think I'm a nice person. I would say, they say, when I make a speech, it's different when I debate. I think when I debate, I've gotten very good marks for the debates. As you know, I won every single online poll. There were seven of them and I won all seven by substantial margins. But I think I have to be a little respectful when I debate. I don't think I should be cutting in like some of the people cut in and I constantly cut in. I actually helped Jeb Bush. I was saying let him speak when I looked at Kasich. I said, let him speak. The man couldn't speak. But I think I'm, yes, I think it's just been working out well. I've enjoyed doing the debates. I've had a lot of fun with it and I think we've done it very well in the debate itself.
And what about Dr. Carson? All right? You're on top nationally and in some polls though he's within spitting distance --
Yes.
A margin of error. Some of them he's been ahead. How are you going to separate yourself from him? Does he worry you?
Well, look, you always think about everybody. Somebody said who is your closest competitor? I mean, they are all -- I have to think about, I mean, other than the ones in the absolute bottom tier and then you wonder why certain people hanging around, it sort of hard to believe that they do this. It can't be helpful to them or their families or their brand, frankly. But somebody said, who is your number one? I said, I think you have many of them. You never know what is going to happen with a political campaign. I haven't done it on this side. I've been a politician for four or five months but I haven't done it from the standpoint of running for office. I've never done this before. I've been a businessman. I've created tremendous numbers of tens and thousands of jobs and built a great company but I've never done this. I would say you have three or four or five people I guess that would have a shot.
And in terms of Dr. Carson, you've said some of the questions about his past are fair. There have been a lot of questions about what really happened, what his childhood was like. You know, he's pushed back in the media. He said at the debate the other night, I have a problem with being lied about. Do you believe he's being truthful now that you've heard his answers?
Well, I don't know, I mean, first of all, I like him. I get along with him very well. I just don't know. I don't forget, this is in his book. I'm not bringing up anything that's not in his book.
So, you're not satisfied yet?
Well, I just don't know. But when somebody said that he's pathological, you'll have to ask him that question. Look, I hope it's fine because I think it would be a shame. But think of it, what he's saying is these things happened. It would be nice if he said, no, none of these things did happen. He's saying, these things happened and therefore I have credibility. And what I'm saying is, I would rather have them if they didn't happen. I don't want somebody that hit somebody in the face really hard with a padlock. I don't want somebody that went after his mother with a hammer.
To be president?
I don't want somebody, frankly -- I didn't read his book but, according to the book, he said he's pathological. That's a very serious term.
So I want to ask you about the immigration -- that is going on out there. You obviously put immigration front and center in the GOP conversation.
You wouldn't even be talking about immigration if it wasn't for me.
You have put it on the table and now of course you were criticized heavily at the debate, right? Kasich, Jeb Bush saying that your proposals were --
Well, they are weak people. No, no, excuse me. They're weak people. I watched Jeb today. They are weak people and case I can made a fool out of himself in the debate. I mean, what he said it was ridiculous. Actually, everybody was pretty much uniform in the fact that Kasich did a bad job with the debate.
How though -- on this one point though of deporting 11 million people, even Marco Rubio today said this morning it can't be done.
What do you mean even Marco Rubio? Marco Rubio is in favor of amnesty, he was a member of the gang of eight. He was always in favor of amnesty. He was in favor of people pouring into the country. And then what happened is when people found that out, he sank like a rock in the water.
He says he's springing onto the criminal record, people like that deported.
OK. Now, he's saying things different.
Which is something that you would support.
Erin, Erin. He is much different now than he was in the past. OK? He's much different. Now, as far as criminal, they're going to be out so fit. If I win, you know, we have tremendous problems. I just gave you an article where an illegal alien ran over today from Texas a policeman three times. Just kept running them over. Look, we have problems. You have Kate in San Francisco. You have the veteran soldier that put this wonderful woman who was 66- years-old, the retired vet who was raped, sodomized and killed by an illegal alien or, as they would say, an illegal immigrant. And this happened three weeks ago in California but it's happening all over. It's a big problem. Crime is a big problem. You also have wonderful people here.
But that's my point.
Excuse me. They came in illegally. They are here illegally.
But how would you do the logistics of it? How would you do the logistics? OK?
First of all, it's all a package.
How do you take 11 million people and make them leave?
Fine. Fine. You'll do it. It's all a package. Number one, we're going to build a wall. We're going to have people coming to the country --
Well, that's the people not coming --
I agree.
OK.
But let's go through it. We're going to build a wall. It's going to be a real. It's going to be a wall that is powerful and that people aren't going to be going under or up or around or anything else. It could be a real wall. And we're going to have a door in the wall. People that are coming in the country legally. And we're going to get rid of a lot of people coming in and that all that will come in legally. We're going to get rid of the bad ones because we have some really bad ones in here right now. And you know that gang members in L.A., you look at some of these gangs. They are 100 percent illegal immigrants. They are going to be gone. OK? And they are going to be gone fast and they are not going to be in our prisons for us to take care of them. Our prisons are bursting with illegals right now. Wait a minute. Sure.
What about the law-abiding majority.
Now we have people who came in illegally.
Yes.
And they are called illegal immigrants and they are here illegally. They are going to have to go and they're going to have to come back illegally. And otherwise, we don't have a country and if we don't do that, we don't have a country. They are going to have to go and they are going to have to come in legally, they are going to have to come in through a system. You have right now, Erin, millions of people that want to come in to the country. Millions. They're on a waiting list. They've gone through documentation. They've gone through all sorts of things and they're waiting on a list in some cases for years.
Yes.
And it's very unfair to them. It's very unfair. Now, you can do the work visa thing in terms of the grapes because I have people friends with the grapes and they may need people. We can do lots of different things.
For the agriculture?
But to come here and stay here, you have to come in to the country legally. We either have a country or we don't. If you go to Mexico --
But --
Erin, if you want to be a citizen of Mexico, you -- and let's assume you're a perfect person.
Uh-huh.
You could not become a citizen of Mexico. It's the hardest place just about in the country, in the world to become a citizen. So --
But the point -- the question I'm asking though is, how do you take 11 million people and make them leave?
You do it through a process. You do it in a very humane manner.
But they are not going to want to leave. You're going to have to hire a lot of people to find them and get them over the border, right?
First of all, they are here illegally. If a person comes across the border and you send them right back, the border patrol sends them right back, there's not a big court situation. They send them back. They are here illegally.
Yes. But what about the guy already living in Detroit?
What's the difference between somebody who comes over the border for two days, he gets caught and they bring him back. And somebody that comes over the border, he's here for a year and you bring them back? There's no difference. What I'm saying is --
Logistically there's a difference in terms of finding them and getting them to go.
We have to find them.
Right. I would agree, unemployment underestimates the problem.
You know, Erin, when I go out to make a speech, I was in Springfield, Illinois, the other day. And I had 10,000 people. Broke Elton John's records and he's got organs and he's got all sorts of instruments and great people. He's got a band, OK? I broke his record. If we had a real 5.2 percent, I wouldn't have 10,000 people there. I wouldn't have 20,000 people in Dallas. And I wouldn't have -- and by the way, the people of Dallas, they know more about this and the people of Phoenix, the crowds I'm getting, because we have a problem in this country. You know, my book, which is a book that discusses all of this, and also talks about solutions which is really very important but the book comes out and the book is doing well because people want the answers to that. I don't want to just be a critic. I want somebody to be that --
Which I understand, which is how I feel the question is fair, right? Of how you find them. A lot of these people -- I hear your point on this E-Verify which by the way when Mitt Romney put that out, hurt him with the Hispanics.
I don't care. Look, look, maybe it hurts, maybe it doesn't. All I know is in Nevada, I'm leading with Hispanics. In other polls, I'm leading with Hispanics. You know who I'm leading with? I'm leading with the Hispanics that are here legally. Of course, the way our country is being run, if you're an illegal immigrant now, you're allowed to vote. I mean, the way our country is being run. If you're an illegal immigrant, they have a city, a little city town or something in California where the illegal immigrants want to get on the town council. I mean, can you believe this? They want to be on the town council. So, the world is changing.
So, to get them. There's been -- which you've seen, right? I'm sure you'll say you can do it cheaper but the number is big. To get all these out of the country --
These are people that don't know what they are talking about.
They say $600 billion.
They also say --
That's bigger than the Department of Defense contract.
Excuse me. They also say it's $15 billion to build a wall that I'll do for six. And by the way, my wall will be bigger and better and stronger and more powerful. Let me just explain something. Illegal immigration each year costs us between 200 and $300 billion. I don't know if anybody gives those numbers, probably not. But when you include crimes and other problems, it's more than that. So you're talking about between 200 and 300 billion, the way it is now. All right?
But they pay in taxes, they pay $24 billion in taxes.
Who pays in taxes? Do you really believe they pay in taxes? They pay a very little.
They pay Social Security, state and local.
Yes. What percentage of them? Ten percent?
So on this point about humanity about, are you going to be sending in officers --
We're going to be sending people in a very nice way --
-- a force of people into people's home to get them out?
We're going to be giving notice. We're going to be saying, we have to go back to wherever the country is. I mean, it's going to be countries, all different countries. It's not just one country. Back to the country. We'll take them back to those country. We'll going to do it in a very humane way. But between E-Verify and other modern systems, a lot of that will happen automatically. And don't forget, we're taking tremendous numbers of jobs from people who were born in this country and you understand that because when you look at the roads, you have 100 million people that potentially want to work and they can't find jobs.
They don't want to pick grapes, though.
Maybe not. And you know what, we can solve that with work visas, where they come in and they work legally. They pay taxes and then they go out. I'm all for that. I think that's true. Because I agree with you, they might not want to pick grapes. Not their thing. I mean, you know, they don't want to do that. And that's OK. But we'll have a work visa where they can come in, work and then at the right time they have to go back home.
Marco Rubio, you disagree with him obviously strenuously on immigration but he is Hispanic, he's obviously -- his parents are Cuban. He has an inspirational story.
That's why he wants amnesty.
Would you put him as a VP on your ticket?
It's too early to say. I like him. I mean, he's a nice guy. I was with him. I've gotten to know him. It's one of the funny things because people say I'm a little rough on some of the candidates. I like them all. I like Jeb Bush. I like them all. I mean --
Yes. You kind of understand why it's hard to get that when you call them a loser or something.
But I like a lot of the candidates.
Yes.
And you know, I mean, but I don't want to talk about vice president now because I want to win first. I don't believe in being one of these people that talks about things and nothing ends up happening. No, I want to win first.
A final question. We're here in your campaign headquarters. Lots of pictures of you. But I believe this is where you filmed The Apprentice. Right?
Also The Apprentice. Yes.
So, people might think that it's fancy and it's not. We've got exposed pipes and --
What if this is a great location with nice high ceilings and that when this is over with we'll have a fabulous company in this space and have rented in about 15 minutes but I kept it empty so that I could have this as our campaign. I mean, one thing you'll say, this is the greatest location in the history of campaign headquarters. That's one thing.
Certainly the most expensive real estate. So, coming in here, though, something happened to me that hasn't happened to me before coming here and that was Secret Service checks.
Yes.
So, you have Secret Service protection. You wanted it. Your code name is mogul. You said you wanted it to be humble.
Yes. I liked humble. I liked humble but they picked mogul and somebody picked it out. I didn't know that the press had that. But I think they had mogul but I would have liked humble because I'm a humble person. Actually, in the debate it came up --
See, what I like about you, Donald is, you can now laugh at yourself.
Well, I can laugh at myself now. But what I'm not laughing about is the sad state of affairs of the country. That's why I'm doing this. And I'm glad I'm running. And you talk about so many of the things you've mentioned. One of the things you didn't mention is corporate inversion because we have companies trying to move out. They're moving out --
We have companies trying to use their favorable tax treatment outside of the United States.
Absolutely. They are moving out of our country to other countries because they get more favorable treatment. We're going to lose a lot of companies unless we have somebody very, very smart and understands what is happening. And I will tell you something, most of the people that are on the -- with me, they didn't even know when I first brought up an incorporate inversions and versions. They didn't even know what it meant, they didn't know what I was talking about. You're going to have to have a very, very good person become president because we have a lot of work to do in this country.
All right. Donald Trump, thank you very much. Good to see you.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
You don't shake hands, do you?
Oh yeah, no, I do shake hands. Well, I've been saying, and it's been borne out... if you have a cold, you pass the cold along to other people, or a flu. But no, I shake hands very gladly politically. I don't think you could be a politician if you didn't shake hands. Can you imagine if I refused to shake anybody's hands? ("No," chimes in Ms. Hicks, who will be remaining here for our interview.) No -- bottom line, I shake hands.
But if you go the whole way, you're going to have to touch a lot of dirty hands between now and next November.
I've been doing it. (Ms. Hicks: "He's been doing it. Thirty thousand people at a rally the other week -- he shook a lot of hands.") I've been shaking thousands and thousands of hands on a daily basis, actually.
Does it make you shiver a little bit inside?
No, it's part of what I have to do to make America great again.
Are you having fun?
I'm having a good time. Because of the success of it, perhaps. It makes it a lot easier than some people that are not doing well. But I've really enjoyed it. I really have.
Many years ago you said, "The fun is in the getting, not the having," and I guess some people wonder whether that's your attitude toward the presidency.
No, actually in this case I don't think there's fun involved. It will be constant work to turn the country around because we have 50 million people on welfare, we have tremendous poverty levels at record numbers. We have almost a hundred million people out of work, out of the workforce.
Putting it in the most basic way, there's a lot of people who really like you, but there's a lot of people who are deeply skeptical of your motives. Some people think it's a campaign driven by egotism, aimless ambition, and arrogance.
This doesn't sound like a nice question! Look, I just have one thing in mind, and that's doing a great job for the country. Everybody has their detractors. Some people say arrogance, or whatever they may say. I only have one thing in mind and that's doing a great job for the country.
Whenever you explain why you'd be a very fine president, a lot of what you say seems to boil down to: Look, just shut up and trust me -- I'd be really good at this. I know I would.
Well, I have been issuing a lot of policy over the last two-week period. But there is a certain amount of truth to that. I mean, I've had tremendous success, and I've just done it. And a lot of my supporters agree with that.
You've broken many of the rules of how candidates usually act....
That's true. That, I agree with you. They say there's never been anything like this.
For instance, in recent times you've referred to other people as: a loser, a total loser, a massive loser, grotesque, a moron, an obvious moron, a spoiled brat, a totally incompetent jerk, a stiff, a dummy, a bimbo, a clown, a low-class slob, a perv sleazebag, a major sleaze and buffoon, a spoiled brat without a properly functioning brain, a goofball atheist, a dope, a dummy dope, a dopey clown, a dog, and so on.
Well, other people have said a lot of things about things, too. They've said plenty of bad stuff.
But you've got a vocabulary and an approach that's different.
Probably. Probably that's why people are here, that's why I have this, you know. (He gestures to the stacks of magazines lying between us.) Every magazine cover. And maybe we'll have another. Are we gonna be the cover story, do you know? Or not? We should be, we should be. Based on merit, we should be. But we'll see. Not sure I want it. You're going to ask a positive question before the interview's over, right?
Well, I think the positive comes from the answer. Anyway, will you still talk like that if you're president?
No. Probably not.
Why not?
Depends. It depends. I think probably I'd be much different. I have a great capacity to be what I have to be, and as president you may want a different tone. But that's a highly competitive tone, and many of those expressions -- not all, but many of those expressions -- are highly descriptive. It's hard to find words to compete with them when talking about somebody. But no, I would imagine I would be quite a bit different. I would feel differently about things as a president. Right now, I'm fighting a lot of people. As a president I would be more measured.
But part of your appeal, and part of what you're selling as your appeal, is that you're different. And if people are going to vote for you, surely they want the real Donald Trump to be the president?
Yeah, I would be. I wouldn't change much, but I think I would probably tone down the rhetoric, perhaps. And perhaps not. Depends on who it was that I was speaking about. We have some bad dudes out there.
If anyone attacks you, you bite back pretty hard, don't you?
Yes. Yes.
If you were the same kind of president as you are a candidate, it sometimes feels like the first time some country disrespected you, you'd just want to nuke them.
No, no, no. But some of these countries are really taking advantage of us and I would fight for fairness of our country.
But would you be scared to nuke them if you thought it was justified?
I wouldn't be nuking anybody.
Under any circumstances?
Under... I will have a military that's so strong and powerful, and so respected, we're not gonna have to nuke anybody.
So could we get rid of the weapons?
No, no, we wouldn't get rid of the weapons. Because you have so many people out there. But I would be somebody that would be amazingly calm under pressure.
But if you're not going to use them, what's the point in having them?
The fact that other people have them. And unfortunately gaining more and more.
But ultimately you have to be prepared to press the button or there's no point in having them?
Well, I don't want to talk about that subject because that's not a subject that, you know... (restarts his thought) that has to do with that whole... (restarts his thought again) I just don't want to talk about it. It is highly, highly, highly, highly unlikely that I would ever be using them.
As you know, people ask a lot of questions about your attitude toward women. When you were asked on The View what your message was to women and you said you wanted to cherish them, protect them, take care of them --
And respect them, yes. I do respect them, I have great respect for women. In fact, one of the reasons The Apprentice was such a successful show for so many years, the audience of women was fantastic.
Sure, but that's an entertainment TV show.
No, but it's indicative. I have great respect for women, and I will do more for women than anybody because I get things done and I know how to do things. And I'll also keep this country safe and secure, which a politician probably won't, because they're weak and ineffective. They're weak, ineffective people, politicians.
What do you say to the women who respond: I'm not that bothered about being "cherished" or "protected" or "taken care of," I just want to be treated equally?
I think you're being politically correct when you ask me a question like that. They do want to be taken care of and they do want to be cherished and they do want to be respected, and I think when you ask a question like that you're just trying to be politically correct, that's all. But that's OK.
People expect you to be asked tough questions, and you're certainly up to answering them.
Sure I am, but, I mean, you know, so far, in all fairness, you've only asked me, like, really negative questions. Wow. I'm saying, this article's going to be a disaster. (Ms. Hicks: "I think we deserve the cover just for tolerating these questions.") It's all right. Whatever.
A similar issue that people are giving you a hard time about is race.
I don't think so. Race? Nobody's giving me a hard time. I just won... I just had the highest percentage ever in a Republican primary -- 25 percent of the African-Americans supported me. (3) So I don't think you're right.
But certainly a lot of people have written, and some people suspect, that even if you're not racist yourself, you're consciously pandering to racist sentiments in parts of the electorate.
I've never heard that. Yeah, well, I've never heard that. No, I mean I am the least racist person that you have ever met.
Obviously there's a big movement, the Black Lives Matter movement...
I don't know -- is it a big movement? I don't know if it's big or if it's small.
What do you make of it?
I don't make anything of it. I saw them steal the microphone from Bernie Sanders and he just yielded, which surprised me. But no, I don't know anything about... You know, when you say it's a big movement, I don't think it's a big movement. You think it's a big movement?
It's very hard to quantify. It's certainly a loud movement. And I think it's an interesting and important idea.
You think it is, actually? Black lives matter? But do you think white lives matter?
Well, the more common response is for people to say "all lives matter," though I understand why some people consider that kind of tone-deaf.
To me, all lives matter. All lives matter.
But can you see how people who are fighting to point out a particular injustice --
(interrupts) No. No, I can't. I can't understand that term, no. I think that term is hurting them, not helping them.
As you know, there's a lot of chatter that if the going gets tough and you go down in the polls, people think you'll just quit.
There is? I haven't...
You tweeted about it yesterday.
Yeah, I mean sure, but when you say a lot of chatter, I don't think there's a lot of chatter. Let's put it this way: I'm in this to win this. I'm not in to play games, I'm not in to come in second and have everybody say how brilliant I was, and how it was the Summer of Trump -- and even now the Autumn of Trump, because I'm doing very well still. The summer ended a while ago.
I was listening to your call-in to Fox and Friends Weekend yesterday morning, talking about the sketch about you that opened the new season of Saturday Night Live. And you said that the only thing you took issue with was the wig, right?
Oh, terrible. It is my hair, by the way, as you know. As you can probably tell. Yeah, I thought the wig was terrible. I thought everything was fine, but I thought the wig was terrible. It was just so cheap-looking to me. I'd like them to get a much better-looking head of hair on the guy.
I guess people have been fascinated by your hair for many, many, many years. Do you understand why that is?
If you look at the way I combed it up there (he gestures toward his photo gallery), I mean, it's similar, right? You know, all these years. I'm a very consistent person. Amazingly consistent person. You know, it is mine. You can follow my record pictorially -- look, see those magazines. It's all the same haircut, right? You know, it's sort of funny. But I've been combing it this way for a long time, I figure I better not stop.
Why do you favor such an unusual style?
I don't think it's that unusual. (Ms. Hicks: "No.") I don't know. To me, it's not that unusual. It's not unusual because it's the way I've been combing it for a long time, since I'm in school.
It is unusual the way it goes forward and backward.
No, it's not really forward and it's not really... You know, if you look you know it's not actually a comb-over.
I guess people are interested in it now because they think it's a sign of a sort of vanity.
Vanity? Sure. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. I don't know, I don't think of it. (Ms. Hicks: "Everybody combs their hair, right?")
A lot of it is because -- and I don't believe this to be the case but -- people don't think there's really hair there.
Well, I mean, can you see it? I mean, I actually have a hairline. (He lifts up the front mass so that I can see a distinct, very regular line of hairs stretching upward from the front of his scalp; I gesture that he doesn't need to do this.) I actually think only the haters -- they know it's real but they say it's not. There are haters that say "it's not his" because they're haters -- it's what they do.
You've explained how you used to praise people who are now political enemies, or people you're competing with, like Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush, (6) by...
I was a businessman, and I had to get along with everybody. Now I'm a politician, I guess. But when I'm a businessman I get along with everybody. Boy, this is gonna be a bad article. (to Ms. Hicks) You think it's gonna be fine? I don't think it's gonna be fine.
OK, so -- so, let me stop you right there. First of all, on the oil, I agree with you completely. We have been saying around this set it has made no sense for the past year why we haven't blown up the pipelines. They make...
And Joe, have I been -- have I been saying that for a long time?
I've been saying that for a long time as well.
There's one difference. I also said I'd keep the oil.
Yeah, well...
I said I'd attack it, but I'd keep it. These people who are going to attack it, they won't keep it. We never keep anything.
Mr. Trump, good morning. When we talk about obliterating ISIS, destroying ISIS, are you prepared to tell the American people that we will deploy large numbers of regular Army forces, regular military forces back to the Middle East to accomplish that goal?
No, I'm not. I would put some there, but I'm not. We have to -- we have to engage the Kurds, who of all of the folks that are out there fighting, the Kurds seem to be the ones that are fighting. And by the way, Steve, thank you for saying such nice things to me over the last number of months. You were there a long time before most, so I appreciate it. I assume that's Steve that's asking the question, right?
No, wait a minute. I want to drill down on this a little bit.
Hey, Joe, Steve was there a long -- Steve was there long before a lot of other people, I will tell you.
All right. Let's -- OK. Let's get back to...
He won't let me give you a compliment, Steve.
OK, the compliment -- here, let's let the compliment sink in. OK. Now let me follow up on the question.
Go ahead.
So, would you at least be willing to send 10,000 U.S. troops over there?
Yes, I would, but Joe, I'd engage other countries...
... and the hatred that can breed?
There as already hatred. The hatred is incredible. It's embedded.
So then it's OK to engage on that?
It's embedded. The hatred is beyond belief. The hatred is greater than anybody understands. And it already there. It not like, what, do you think they think we're great people? It's already there. It's a very, very sad situation. And I know so many people, Muslims who are such unbelievably great people and they're being so badly tarnished by what's happening. It's a shame. You can't lose track of these..
You would agree, Donald...
What Joe?
You would agree Donald, that this is just a small percentage of these radical Muslims, are a small percentage of the entire Muslim population.
Yes, but it's a tremendous amount of horror and damage and vitriol. I mean, you look at what's happening. This is something that has to be stopped and we have to be very strong, we have to be vigilant and we have to be intelligent. We need to bring back our intelligence agencies and bring them to a much higher level. I mean, they're using the Internet, Joe, better than we are.
Thank you, Donald, for calling in.
Thank you very much.
Yes, but not all from Syria. That 255,000 number's over three years, not all necessarily from Syria, but we don't know where they're coming from. And...
We have no idea where they're coming from!
Yes, well, it's funny...
There certainly seems to be.
Well, then my question...
We have a backward banking system...
Well said. All right, Mr. Trump, thank you so much for your time. We appreciate it.
Thank you very much, Sean.
Yes, it's pretty unbelievable. That should be a very thorough investigation. Especially as a former prosecutor when I look and compare the facts and circumstances and you see what happened to General Petraeus.
Right.
So you'd bring back waterboarding?
We have to -- I would bring it back, yes. I would bring it back. I think waterboarding is peanuts compared to what they'd do to us, what they're doing to us, what they did to James Foley when they chopped off his head. That's a whole different level and I would absolutely bring back interrogation and strong interrogation.
But what would be your criteria --
We're dealing with --
-- for closing a mosque?
We're dealing with very -- George, we're dealing with very, very strong people. And you need strength and you need stamina.
I get that, but --
Hillary does not have that.
But why should someone on the watch list --
-- out of hundreds of people had guns --
-- be able to have a gun?
-- no, no. You -- if people are on a watch list or people are sick, you have already -- this is already covered in the legislation that we already have, George. It's already fully covered.
Well, but under current law --
But we have --
-- people on the watch list --
-- if we have an enemy of state --
But yesterday...
I'll tell you who would have been hurt, the bad guys would...
But yes or no?
-- because they were the only ones that had the guns.
Mr. Trump, yes or no, should someone on the terror watch list be allowed to buy a gun?
If somebody is on a watch list and an enemy of state and we know it's an enemy of state, I would keep them away, absolutely.
You saw that...
It was on television. I saw it.
-- with your own eyes.
George, it did happen.
You know that's...
That's the real number he wants. I've even heard 250,000 people. We have a president that doesn't know what he's doing. We have a president, George, who is totally incompetent.
But you're open...
-- in Alabama...
Mr. Trump, thanks for your time this morning.
Thank you very much.
All right. But they will be if they get papers to come here. ICE Home Security will know who they are, will know where they go. So, what you want is a reality already, is it not?
No. What I want is I do not want them to come here --
All right. OK.
We should not be taking anybody. We should do --
OK.
-- well, we should not do it, because we have no idea -- ICE, do you believe in ICE. Look what happened to Kate. You know Kate very well. What happened in -- Probably, better than most -- what happened in San Francisco --
I do not have any confidence they can vet them.
-- and so many others.
I do not have any confidence they can vet them.
Yes. They have no -- they will not vet them properly.
But, if it were me, and I were running as a republican, instead of saying, "I do not want them," I would say, "I will take some women and Children, and they have to be properly vetted by the FBI, not Homeland Security, because we do not trust them. But I will take some women and children, who are languishing in these camps." That puts a humane face on it, and does not put us in danger, would not that be smartest strategy?
Well, I will tell you. You mean children like we took in Boston, the two brothers that did so much damage during the Boston Marathon. They were very young when they came here and you see what happened to them. I would not say they would nice -- they were radicalized.
No, but this is homegrown -- all the terrorism that took place in Charleston was homegrown. You are never going to have a guarantee. You just want to put a face on the Republican Party that you are not just mean guys and that is what the Democrats are trying to do to you.
Hey, Bill. I would do something much different, much different. I would do a free zone, safe zone in Syria. I would get other people in other countries to support us --
All right. We have the same vision about --
We just do not know enough about it.
We have the same vision about safe zones inside Syria, but I am working through NATO. You have not mentioned NATO. Why not?
I think NATO would be fine. I think it is great. I think it is certainly makes it a little bit easier. If you declare war, you go through NATO, but I would add a lot of countries, frankly to the NATO group that we already have, so I think it is fine.
Yes. If you could persuade -- to pick up the tab here and there, that would be a good thing, and you think you could do that?
Well, it would be nice. I mean they do have plenty of money, OK?
All right.
It would be nice if they contribute it. And, by the way, so should many other countries contribute; but that way, they are in their country. You know, I read a case where some people are sent to Minnesota. It was 10 degrees below zero. They go from Syria to Minnesota. Not exactly so great. They probably want to be there. You do a safe zone --
Well, it does not matter what they want.
You do a free zone.
If you have a safe zone in your own country, they stay there. It does not matter what they want. OK. Are you aware --
It is a much better idea and certainly better for us.
Are you aware that the liberal media and the Democratic Party in general, trying to paint you as a racist? Are you aware of that?
I think so. But, I think people know better than that.
OK. All right.
I am probably the least racist person on earth.
Well, I have known you a long time.
I think people know better than that.
And, I never saw any racism from you. However, when you tweet out a thing, and this bothered me, I got to tell you. You tweeted out that whites killed by blacks, these are statistics you picked up somewhere at a rate of 81 percent. And, that is totally wrong, whites killed by blacks is 15 percent. You tweeted it was 81 percent. Now --
Bill, I did not tweet. I re-tweeted somebody that was supposedly an expert and was also a radio show.
Yes. But, you do not want to be -- why do you want to be in that zone?
Hey, Bill. Bill, am I going to check every statistic? I get millions and millions of people.
You got to. You are a presidential contender, you got to check it.
I have millions of people. You know what? Fine. But, this came out of radio shows and everything else.
Oh, come on! Radio shows?
All of it was a re-tweet. It did not say -- excuse me, all it was is a re-tweet. It was not from me. And, it did. It came out of radio show --
It would have been better.
-- because you see all the names.
Look, you know I am looking out for you, right? You know that? I am looking out for you. I look out for every honest politician. I do not care what party they are in. Do not do this. Do not put your name on stuff like this, because it makes the other side -- It gives them stuff to tell the ill informed voter that you are a racist. I mean, you just handed them a platter.
Well, this was a re-tweet. Bill, I am sure you are looking out for me.
All right.
Everybody is, right?
Yes.
This was a re-tweet.
All right, whatever it is --
And, it came from sources that are very credible --
I told you, you should not tweet ever.
What can I tell you.
You should not be tweeting. Do not tweet. Give it up for lent.
All right. Sure.
Lent is coming soon.
OK.
Give it up. All right, final question.
You know what, I like it -- Can I tell you what? I like it because I can get, also, my point of view out there. And, my point of view is very important to a lot of people that are looking at me.
All right.
And, as far as what they have done in terms of me, you just had poll --
Got it.
-- wait a minute. You just had a poll and going even against Hillary, I win easily. I think you can see that, it was in a FOX poll that just came out.
Well, your favorite guy, Karl Rove has that poll two segments away or even -- I do not know -- yes, it is two segments away and we have all the numbers. Final question.
Well, let me just say something. Wait a minute. Let me just say something. Karl Rove spent over $400 million trying to win races for the republicans. $400 million, he did not win a race.
Why do not you try to win him over --
Karl Rove should not even be on your program.
Why do not you win him over?
I do not want to win him. He fought for so many people and lost every single one.
All right.
I do not have to win him over.
All right.
I do not want to win him over, not after what he says about me. It is totally biased. He should not be on your show, frankly.
But, we have the poll numbers and they cannot be biased because they are straight numbers. I want to talk to you about NATO --
But, who is leading in the polls?
-- But we are going to do that --
Bill, who is leading --
You are.
Bill, who is leading in the poll?
You are. You.
All right. Good.
You are leading in the poll.
Good.
All right. You also have a book out.
Explain that to Karl Rove.
Crippled America, right? It is doing pretty well, the book?
All right.
Anything else you want me to do?
And, it is doing well, "Crippled America".
Anything else you want me to do?
No, nothing else. Just be fair. Just be fair.
Always fair.
All I ask is fairness. Level playing field. All I asked 0-
I am Mr. Fairness. You are looking at him right here.
Yes. OK. OK.
All right. We always appreciate you coming on, Donald.
Thank you very much.
... at the same time also wrote about rumors of rooftop celebrations. The Washington Post -- I looked, I don't see one example where they made a correction in 15 years or 14 years. The Star-Ledger...
They did no correction, absolutely.
Yes.
And I am right. I mean, I'm 100 percent right. You had the -- -- you -- look, I'm only saying it because we have to be vigilant. I'm not saying it for any reason. I don't want to stir anything up. But you have some people living here, where we have some very, very serious problems. We have to be very careful. We have to be very vigilant.
They're the richest terrorist organization...
Oh, making a fortune.
I don't think the country can afford to lose again. I'm going to play you...
We cannot afford it.
All right, Mr. Trump, always a pleasure. Thanks for being with us.
Thank you very much.
I'm joined on the phone by the Republican presidential frontrunner right now, Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS.
Good morning.
In Jersey City? You saw --
In the area. I also heard Paterson -- excuse me.
This didn't happen in New Jersey. There were plenty of reports and you're --
Chuck, it did happen in New Jersey. I have hundreds of people that agree with me.
Just because somebody repeats something doesn't make it true. And I guess that's actually --
Hundreds. I don't mean I had two calls, Chuck. Even yesterday I was in Sarasota, Florida and people were saying they lived in Jersey --
People were saying. Mr. Trump, if I say well, people have said Mr. Trump is not worth $10 billion you would say that was crazy. You wouldn't make a business deal --
But that's based on --
Based on re-tweets and hearsay.
This is much different.
Let me ask you about your reaction to what happened in Colorado.
OK. Well, I think it's terrible. I mean, terrible. It's more of the same and I think it's a terrible thing. And he's a maniac. He's a maniac.
A spokesperson for Planned Parenthood says -- is concerned the heated rhetoric around the Planned Parenthood debate could have had an adverse affect basically on this mentally disturbed individual. You think the rhetoric got out of hand on Planned Parenthood?
No, I think he's a sick person and I think he was a -- probably a person ready to go. We don't even know the purpose -- I mean he hasn't come out to the best of my knowledge with a statement as to why it happened to be at that location.
Well, we have reporting --
He lived in a different area.
So that means you're not surprised that someone might take an extreme reaction to this?
Well, this was an extremist and this was a man who obviously -- and they said prior to this that he was mentally disturbed so he's a mentally disturbed person -- there's no question about that.
But it does sound like you understand why people might react this way?
Well, there's tremendous -- there's tremendous dislike, I can say that. Because I go to rallies and I have by far -- and you will admit that, I think, but I have by far the biggest crowds, nobody even close and that includes Bernie Sanders. By the way, whose crowds are going down, down, down, like a rock ever since he gave Hillary a free pass on the emails? But I see a lot of anxiety and I see a lot of dislike for Planned Parenthood. There's no question about that.
Is there a way you could lose this nomination and feel as if you were treated fairly by the Republican Party?
Yes, there is. And there's also a way I could lose the nomination and feel that I was treated unfairly by the Republican Party.
And right now you feel the Republican Party is doing what?
Right now I have no opinion. I just know that I'm winning by a lot. I really have no opinion. But I feel that I'm winning by a lot.
All right. Well, we are long overdue for a face to face. I think we're putting it in the works hopefully before Christmas. Mr. Trump -- thanks for coming on.
I look forward to it. Thank you very much -- Chuck.
Joining us now, Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump. Donald, how are you this morning?
Good morning. But you have to get the facts correct also because in Sarasota you said 5,000 people, and you can check this very carefully because it was announced by the government -- it was 12,000 people, not 5,000 people.
Did you really have 12,000 people?
I had 12,000 people, it was announced by the convention center and by government, not by me, and it was 12,000. So we have to get our facts straight, Mika.
Yeah, we can't afford to have you ask a question at this point, Mika. Donald, let me ask you first, Senator John McCain, we just had him on earlier, yesterday he was asked about some of your rhetoric and things you've said about Muslim-Americans, including the question of some celebrating in Jersey City, and he said this has the effect of turning Muslims all over the world against the United States of America, which is 99.44 percent people who practice an honorable religion. Other people have said that as well. Does John McCain have a point?
I don't think he has a point because I would say we are not exactly loved by many Muslims and whether it's 10 percent, like you said on the show this morning, or whether it's a much larger percent, you saw the soccer game the other day where they were giving a minute of silence. I assume you saw that where the stadium burst out talking about and shouting out things that even the soccer players were very embarrassed, nobody knew what to do. They were doing Muslim chants and that was a week ago or less than a week ago, that was right after the strategy in Paris. They were honoring with a minute of silence and it was not a pretty picture. So I think John McCain is incorrect. I think we have to be strong. I think we have to be vigilant. I have many Muslim friends. They're wonderful people. But we nevertheless, we have to be extremely vigilant and extremely strong and we have to understand what the problem is. I don't think John McCain probably does understand the problem.
Yeah -- we're talking about a match though, you're talking about a soccer match in Turkey. There are well over a billion Muslims. We don't paint an entire religion based on the chance of a few people in a soccer --
Not a few people. A lot of people at that soccer game were going wild with their chanting. Everybody was very embarrassed. We're not talking about a few people.
I mean we know the facts. You said people went wild after 9/11, Muslims went wild all over the world after 9/11 --
Well, think did.
Well you can look at -- Whether it's even Iran or you look at just about every Muslim government in the world other than the Palestinians, they were holding candlelight vigils and holding prayer services for us.
Sure. I'm not saying everybody, but there's a large percentage of people that, as you said, went wild and were celebrating all over the world. I think people have to recognize it., Joe. And if you don't recognize it then we're never going to solve the problem. But there were a large number of people who celebrated the downing of the World Trade Center.
Why is that important?
This is something I said and it keeps getting brought up. I mean I'm not bringing this up, you're bringing this up. But it keeps getting brought up. You can go back just last week in the soccer game during the one minute of silence in honor of the people that were absolutely slaughtered, disgustingly slaughtered in that horrible thing that took place in Paris. You see what happened during that one minute of silence.
Why --
It was not a pretty situation.
Well, no, but it's come up in your speeches and I guess I would start by asking it this way. How would you characterize most Muslim-Americans? How would you characterize them?
They're terrific people. I know many, Mika. I know many. They're terrific people, Mika. I have many, many friends that -- but within the Muslim-American community and within the Muslim community, we have some very radical people who want to do great harm to you and to Joe and everybody on your panel and to me and to this country and to the world. Now, we can say that doesn't exist and everybody will be very happy until it's a problem, but it does exist. They are wonderful people. I know so many of them. And by the way, the ones I know all agree with me. They say there is a radical group of people that is doing great harm and doing great harm to them because they get tainted by what's going on.
Is it a -- do you believe it is a small, small percentage?
You mentioned before it could be 10 percent. That's a lot, Joe, if it's 10 percent. Hey Joe, 10 percent, you know, you were sort of saying it's only 7 percent. But maybe 10 percent. Well 10 percent, or 7 percent, or 2 percent is a lot when you're talking about the kind of destruction they want to do.
Donald let me just ask you this question in a way that we like to ask it -- that we have our pollsters ask this question -- and I'll ask it to you as a voter, as a potential -- as a presidential candidate. Do you think that Islam is an inherently peaceful religion that's been, by some small percentage as you just said, whatever the percentage is, perverted by some, or do you think that Islam is an inherently violent religion?
Well all I can say, John, there's something going on. You know, there's something definitely going on. I don't know that that question can be answered. It could be answered two ways. I could be answered both ways. But there's something going on there. There's something that there's a lot of hatred coming out of, at least a big part of it. You see the hatred. I mean we see it every day. You see it whether it's in Paris or whether it's the World Trade Center or whether it's even one minute of silence at a soccer game out of respect for the people that died and there was no respect by a pretty good group of people in that stadium. That was a week ago. Less than a week ago. There's something nasty coming out of there. You can answer it anyway you want. But at least we have to know the problem.
Yes. I'm worried about the ramifications of the conversation if it gets too ugly. And it has gotten ugly.
I don't worry about it. And I don't worry about help, Joe. I'll be honest. I'm not looking to do this for help. Whether I win or lose, I'm not doing this for that. I'm doing it because somebody has to bring it to the floor and nobody does it and we have a leader whose incompetent and he doesn't do it and he doesn't want to do it and he refuses to use the name and it's almost like, what do you have to do, what has to be done to have him finally utter the words that he should be uttering to talk about what the real problem is? He won't do it.
Robert Costa with The Washington Post  is with us and has a question. Robert.
Hi, Robert.
Donald, let's get to some other topics here really quickly. A couple of people that have moved up in the polls and now vying for second place. Cruz and Rubio. Do you think Ted Cruz is qualified to be president of the United States? Would he be a good president?
Yes, I do think he's qualified. I do think he would be qualified to be. Absolutely.
What about Marco Rubio?
I think so. Yeah, he's young, he's very young. He's got a bad voting record in Florida, but -- and he's got a weak record on borders. If you look at border security, if you look at illegal immigration, very weak on that and strong on amnesty, which bothers me about him. But he's a nice guy, I've gotten to know him during the campaign. I like him. I think he would have a shot.
So you're critical and we're showing a poll right now that as you -- a Quinnipiac poll -- first place Cruz, second, Carson, third, Rubio, fourth. Let me ask you about --
I think I'm in first place every single state and every single national poll.
Yes, it is time for you to --
That's right. As Joe would joyfully say -- and jokingly say -- Uh oh, Trump just picked up ten points. Time for him to drop out.
It's time to quit. So we -- So you've talked about Marco Rubio supporting amnesty, you don't say bad things about Ted Cruz, but a lot of people in the intel community very concerned that Ted Cruz is closer to Rand Paul than, say, a traditional Republican on issues of intel, whether it's NSA data collection. Do you think Ted Cruz is too weak on national security?
Well I'm going to watch -- and I've been watching this little debate between Rubio and Cruz and I loved it because I haven't been so involved. It's the one thing I haven't been involved. Can you believe it? I'd love to watch it again. And they seem to be attacking themselves very strongly because somebody wants to be standing to challenge me. Carson has now faded badly --
What about, though, on the issue that I brought up, though? Do you think the NSA should have the ability to collect all of the data that it was able to before? Do you --
Well I err on the side of the security, Joe. You know, it's a very interesting issue. But I happen to be -- and I've been there from the beginning. I've been there from before the Paris attack. You know, after every attack everybody says exactly this, but I err on the side of the security. I err on the side of security. You know, every time I pick up a phone I assume people are listening to my conversations. I don't like it but I have to make that assumption. I would really much err on the side of security. As a lot of people would agree with me on that.
Donald, just to go back to the beginning of this interview and button this up, do you think there's any chance that video you think you saw in Jersey City was the video of people in the West Bank Palestinians celebrating on September 11?
No, I don't. And yet to being it up again, Willie. It's so wonderful that you brought it up again. This is why you can't get away from these subjects instead of talking about things that are --
All right. Donald Trump, we'll leave it there. Thank you very much for being on the show this morning.
Thank you very much, Mika.
I begin this hour with the best interview in America, Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, welcome back to the Hugh Hewitt Show.
Well, thank you very much, Hugh.
I am a season ticket holder to the Browns, and I want to begin on football, because I could use some of that winning so much that we're sick of winning. Did you watch that game last night?
I didn't watch it. I heard about it. But you know, the Browns, I don't know, tell me about it. What was the final outcome of that game, Hugh?
We lost on the kick six. They blocked our winning field goal, they ran it back, and we lost on the last play.
So sad, such a great history in the past. Of course, you could say that there's been a movement of a franchise and then a new franchise, right?
That's correct.
So it's a great football area, and they'll be fine. They'll be fine.
OK, if you drop out, I'm just saying, Jimmy Haslam could use some help. I was on CNN this morning, Donald Trump, and I said your campaign could be a Harvard Business School case study in marketing a brand. Yesterday, you were at Trump Tower with all of the African-American pastors. Have you raised rents there given how much publicity Trump Tower has gotten in the last six months?
You know, it's funny, I just had a call from a major reporter, not as big as you, of course, nobody's as big as you, but I just took a call from a very big reporter asking me the very, a business reporter, saying you know, you're leading in every poll, Mr. Trump, could I ask you a question? Has this had a positive impact on your properties? And I said you know, I haven't really thought about it, but the answer is yes. Doral in Miami is doing phenomenally. My projects all over the place, somehow it has. I mean, it's been, it's been good. I didn't do this for that reason, Hugh, but it's had a very positive impact on my other things.
I think it's arguably true that the Trump Tower, which already was famous, may be the most famous property in the world now. Do you think I'm right?
Well, it's getting right up there. It's certainly not far behind, that I can tell you. There are a couple of pretty good ones, but it's right up there, Hugh.
Have you raised rents in it since this started?
No, I think I'll try and keep people happy by keeping it. They were pretty high. Honestly, they're pretty high to start off with.
And that, could you unpredictably exit this race and just say you've accomplished your goals? Or are you in it to win it?
No, I would never, I'm not leaving this race. You know, it's such a great, because I use the word unpredictable. And our country has to be more unpredictable. And sometimes, even when you will ask me a question in terms of military or military strategy, I don't like to tell people, because you know, I'm being the leader, and you know, having a real shot at it, and a real shot at winning. You have to be unpredictable to the enemy like when President Obama sent 50 people over two weeks ago. Number one, who's bragging about 50 people? But the enemy now is looking for those 50 people. Why would he announce that he's doing 50 people and sending them over to Syria, Iraq, wherever they may end up? Everybody's looking for them, and there's something really good. We need unpredictability. You know, George Patton and General Douglas MacArthur, great generals, they didn't talk about what they did. They did it, and then they talked afterward. And so there is something awfully good about unpredictability from the standpoint of our country. But we are totally predictable. We announce when we're leaving, we announce who we're sending and how many, we announce all sorts of things, when we're attacking. It's hard to believe how incompetent our leaders are, and leader in particular.
Sometimes allies need predictability, though. Japan needs to know if they're attacked, we will rally to them. Taiwan needs to know that. I'm sure...
Well, that's OK. That's a different thing. I agree with that.
Right.
That's different.
If Russia shoots down one of our F-18s off of a carrier, or one of our A-10s out of Turkey, what must the President do? I mean, what must he do if Russia does that with the missiles they've just deployed?
Well you know, the way we're going about our foreign policy right now, and the dislike, obviously dislike that Putin and Obama have, although it seems to be perhaps a little bit warmer than it was. But I would certainly look at different options, but I wouldn't want to tell you what those options are. It would really depend on a lot of circumstances. You know, you can't phrase a question like that. You really have to talk about very specific circumstances. But let's hope it doesn't happen, because that's not something we want, and believe me, it's not something that Russia's going to want.
But it's spiraling, don't you think?
Well, it could be.
When Turkey shoots down...
I mean, you could have, with our very stupid leaders, you could end up in World War III over Syria.
Yes, you could. And so if it goes that way, what do you want the people of the American electorate to know about how a President Trump would react to that kind of an incident?
I would be strong, I would be forceful, I would be respected, and maybe so much so that it wouldn't happen, because that's what you really want. You don't want things like that to happen.
All right, fair enough. Are you sticking with your Jersey City estimate?
Oh, yeah, sure. I will tell you that an article came out recently that was, meaning we found it recently. I think it was on September 13th of obviously that very terrible year, and it was a story in the Post. I put it on Twitter, @RealDonaldTrump. And I have another one, @RealDonaldTrump, where Curtis Sliwa, you know, the Guardian Angels...
Yes.
He was doing a show of some kind, either a television or a radio show, and he talked about what was happening over in New Jersey. And yeah, people know, and I have been called by hundreds of people, Hugh. I have been called by literally hundreds of people, and also, you know, the Twitter, which is so big, between Facebook and Twitter, I have ten million people. And it's been, in fact, I should have said I'm doing the show. You would have gotten ratings that would have been five times greater, OK?
You can do it. You can still tell them.
I should do that. I should have said I'm doing the show at a certain time. That would have been a good thing. Next time, Hugh, just remind me. I'll do that.
All right.
But you know, it's sort of an amazing thing. But Curtis Sliwa was talking about it two or three days after the event. So I'm right, and you know, many people, I was in Sarasota, Florida. We had, you probably heard, we had 12,000 people. Four of those people in just walking through said Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, we lived in, you know, and I walked through, and I signed, and I do a lot of things where we have a lot of fun together. And considering we're talking about very negative subjects, which is, you understand that, but four people said to me I used to live in New Jersey. You're absolutely right. That happened. And you know, it's become such a big deal. People are talking about it. And all I'm saying is we have to surveil. We have to be very careful. There are a lot of bad things happening, and we have to be very careful.
Mayor Giuliani was on CNN before I was this morning, and he said there were demonstrations of celebration. They were isolated. One happened in a candy store, but that hundreds and hundreds did not demonstrate. I personally believe that you are remembering the Gaza celebration, which was vast, and conflating events, but that you genuinely do remember it. And I don't doubt your sincerity one moment. I don't...
Well, you know, look...
I don't know that, but, go ahead.
I have a great memory, and there were people that were tailgating, as they said. You know, the Washington Post wrote about tailgating, and he said, you know, tailgating means a lot of people. And they would also talk about on rooves, that they were celebrating on rooves. They were celebrating in the street. So I mean, regardless of how many people, I can't tell you how many people, but it was done. And then if you look worldwide, Hugh, it was definitely done, because...
Oh, sure.
... because as you know...
Oh, Gaza...
... that was well-reported.
Gaza.
That was well-reported, and you look well, I mean, look, a week ago, when they had the soccer game, and the two teams were stopped for a moment of silence, and many, many, many people were shouting things that you're not supposed to be shouting. This was a minute of silence for the people slain in Paris, so horribly.
Yeah, that happened in Turkey. I saw that, too.
And you know...
Let me ask you about...
That was a pretty bad thing that happened. In fact, all of the players, they didn't know what to do.
Yeah, let me switch subjects on you to the President today. Before he left France, he warned about climate change. He said that the seas, I think he said, I think this is a direct quote, I could be wrong, and I think it's a direct quote, that they were rapidly rising.
Yeah.
Do you believe that sea levels are increasing dramatically, Donald Trump?
No, no I don't. I don't believe that, and I don't think...
Do you think his claim will be fact-checked...
I think there are changes, because the changes, and you can have changes up, changes down. You're going to have warmer, you're going to have cooler. It's called weather. It's called other things. But no, I don't believe that. I think that, you know, they may be going up a little bit, and they'll at some point be going down a little bit. And the end result is when he talks about climate change as being the single greatest problem confronting our country and the world, this man is really out of it.
Do you think his claim about rising sea levels will be fact-checked to anything like the degree your claim about New Jersey was fact-checked?
No, they won't fact-check him. You know, the thing about what he says about climate change, nobody, I watched two people last night on Hannity, I mean, on your friend, Sean Hannity's, show.
Yup.
And you had one that was pro-climate change, or whatever you want to call it. You know, they come up with so many different names, Hugh, between they start with global warming, that wasn't working so well, then they go climate change. Now, they have extreme weather, which I see quite a bit. You know, they want to make it, because a lot of these terms that they come up with don't work so well. So they had one as saying a lot of things are happening, and they have another one saying no. And the one who said no, the one that believes as you do and as I do, absolutely beat the hell out of the other guy. And it was really actually very interesting to watch. But if you were watching as an impartial observer, you would not be a big fan of climate change after watched this...
We did. We did talk about that once.
OK.
And you were way ahead of the time.
And you know, a lot of people are saying well, Trump mentioned that in his book before the World Trade Center came down, two years before the World Trade Center came down. I said you've got to get him, and he was a guy that was just a nasty guy talking big stuff. And I said you'd better get him, you'd better watch out for him. I didn't like him, and you know, it was mentioned. I talked about terrorism before terrorism was terrorism.
But I'd like to know your generals.
And that got some current from some people.
I'd love, you know, like Ben Carson has General Dees, and other people have different generals advising them. Have you got any two-stars, three-stars, four-stars that are going to sign up with Trump?
The answer is yes. Oh, yes, I do. Yes, I do.
And when do we get them, because I want to talk to them.
I would say within the next three to four weeks.
Terrific.
And I'm working with them, and I'm, you know, I feel I have a very good grasp. One of them said wow, you really understand foreign policy, and you really understand military policy. A general told me that. He was shocked, actually, if you want to know the truth, because he assumes that I'm, you know, really great at real estate, and really good at deals, but I really do have an understanding of that, and I know what to do. And I see what's happening, and I listen to some of our so-called experts on television, and it makes you nauseous to listen to them, because they don't know what they're talking about. So you know, I think it actually could end up, you know, every poll shows that I'm the best on leadership, I'm the best on the economy, I'm the best on the borders, and you know, and the best on terrorism. Some people have me as the best on the military. I think the military is going to be a very strong point if I win. I think the military is going to be a strong point, Hugh.
You make the media uncomfortable. I was on the set with Chuck Todd when he said Mr. Trump, you're running for president, your words matter. And you make the media uncomfortable, because you are so blunt and straightforward, and you say controversial things. Is that a help in a general election like it is in a primary election?
Well, it's certainly a help in the primary. I guess some polls are coming out today. We'll have to see. But I'll bet you they're pretty good. And I think it certainly is a help, and Chuck is a nice guy, but boy, he was really trying, I said Chuck, cool it, just relax, take it nice and easy, take a deep breath, because he was really trying to go at me, and I said what are you doing? What's the purpose of this? But you know, I think being a straight talker today, with all of the crooked talk, with all of the dumb talk, with all of the people that are incompetent talking, I think it helps, Hugh. I think it's a positive.
All right, now let me ask you about the big debate between Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. I had Senator Cruz on yesterday, Senator Rubio the week before, and I'm sure they'll all be back before Las Vegas, on metadata collection. Ted Cruz is glad that the NSA got out of it. Marco Rubio wants it back. What's Donald Trump think?
Well, I tend to err on the side of security, I must tell you. And I've been there for longer than you would think. But you know, when you have people that are beheading, if you're a Christian, or, and frankly, for lots of other reasons, when you have the world looking at us and would like to destroy us as quickly as possible, I err on the side of security. And so you know, that's the way it is. That's the way I've been, and some people like that, frankly, and some people don't like that. But I think, and I'm not just saying that since Paris, I'm saying for quite some time. I assume when I pick up my telephone, people are listening to my conversations anyway, if you want to know the truth. It's pretty sad commentary, but I err on the side of security.
All right, so you would be in favor of restoring the Patriot Act?
I think that would be fine. As far as I'm concerned, that would be fine.
All right, now a couple of economic issues. If there is tax reform, will Donald Trump argue to save the home mortgage interest deduction...
Yes.
... the charitable interest deduction...
Yes.
... and the state income tax deduction?
Well, the home interest, let's go one at a time. Yes, because I know, nobody knows housing like I do. Nobody knows jobs like I do. And nobody knows the economy like I do. If you take the interest deduction away, you're going to destroy the housing industry.
Amen. God, thank you. Would you call some Republicans and tell them that?
Well, they don't get it. Look, these are people that never produced a job, most of them, I guess. You know, I'm not talking about all of them, but you know, most of them. And you know, I was going over it. I've produced tens of thousands of jobs. I have thousands of employees. But I've produced over my life tens of thousands of jobs. Nobody knows more about that than me. You get rid of the interest deduction, interest mortgage deduction, you will see a housing industry that crashes. And it's, in a sense, our biggest industry. You understand.
Yes.
You add it all up together...
Four jobs for every one created, yeah.
It's our biggest industry.
How about the charitable deduction?
I would say that I would leave the charitable deduction. People do use it. They do give to charity. Some abuse the deduction. I'm sure we can do certain work on it. But the charitable deduction would be fine, as far as I'm concerned, to leave.
And the state income tax deduction, because I live in California, and I think the state will collapse if that goes away.
Yeah, no, I think you're going to have to leave it. You're going to have to leave it. Otherwise, you're going to see some states... now the problem with that is, you know, you have some states that have really been well-behaved, and they do it right. And those people are actually, you know, not benefiting by this, whereas you have other states that are over-levered, over-borrowed, and they're taking maximum advantage of the federal government, which in a way is unfair. You know, you have other states that don't even have the problem because they have so little debt out there. So those people or those states are being punished by, but in the meantime, I think you have to leave it. You're changing the ballgame so rapidly that I could see leaving it, and I would be fine with it.
Last question on taxes, last question for today, and I'll see you in Las Vegas.
OK.
The Forbes 400 has you listed at 121. I went through and added up the top 50 today, you know, beginning with Gates and then Warren Buffett and the Koch Brothers and Larry Ellison. The top 50 have $1.1 trillion dollars in wealth. Shouldn't we have a wealth tax in this country, Donald Trump, to redistribute? That's a lot of money in the hands of 50 people.
No, I don't think so. These are job producers, and I don't think so. And I'm not saying that because I'm on the list. I'm just saying I don't think so at all. I think that when you do that, you really, you know, there was a time years ago when I wanted to pay off the deficit, and I said I would be OK if they took a certain percentage of what I had, and which was much smaller than what I have right now, but took a certain percentage and let's pay off the deficit. But now, our deficit is so humongous, nothing's going to matter. I mean, the only thing that's going to pay off our deficit is having a raging, great economy, which under my tax plan, and by the way, the great Larry Kudlow agrees with me, he loves my plan, you know that, and he's a friend of yours and he's a terrific guy.
Yup.
But under my tax plan, I think we're going to have a really dynamic economy. That's what we have to do.
But the income inequality, the wealth inequality, not income inequality, when you're got people with $50 billion dollars, and you've got people with $50 dollars, it does produce incredible disturbance. I think actually that's what's behind Black Lives Matter, is that there's income inequality. It's behind Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. Doesn't a wealth tax at least take some of the sting out of that?
Well, but then you do take away the incentive to go out and become great, and you take away a lot of incentive from a lot of people. So it's a double, you know, it's very much of a double-edged sword. Where you can solve the problem and really solve your problems is make the economy great, and make the economy strong.
More on that in Las Vegas. Donald Trump, always a pleasure to talk to you, thank you for spending time with me today. Feel free to tweet out they can listen to it this afternoon.
I will. Next time, I have to do it before I speak to you, though. That's the only problem. You know, doesn't help right now, right?
Oh, it does. They can listen to the podcast anytime.
OK, well, I'll do something.
Thank you. Talk to you soon.
Thank you very much, Hugh, great honor, thank you.
I've got so many questions, but you are vindicated. This has got to be the 50th time in the last six months on the radical Muslims celebrating not just in New Jersey, but New York, Palestine, all over. What do you have to say? They're still attacking you, though. We've got Dan Rather on video. We've got New York Post. We've got Washington Post. I mean, what's going on here?
Well, I took a lot of heat. I was very strong on it and I held my line, and then all of a sudden hundreds of people were calling up my office. I was, the other day, in Sarasota, Florida and people are in line and we had 12,000 people, which is fantastic. Many of the people from New Jersey, four or five people said, "Mr. Trump, I saw it myself. I was there. They talked about Patterson," but they said, "I saw it myself, Mr. Trump. I was there." So many people have called in, and on Twitter @realdonaldtrump they're all tweeting. I knew it happened and I held my line, and people wanted me to apologize, and we can't do that. People like you and I can't do that so easily. Now, we can do it if we're wrong, Alex. You apologize. I'd apologize if I was wrong, but they were celebrating, and they were celebrating the fall of the World Trade Center. I think that's disgraceful.
Mr. Trump, I hate to interrupt you. You are the leading presidential front-runner with the Republicans, gaining as huge lead as you don't back down, but I've got to just back you up again-
Go ahead.
... because the more I research what you've actually said and done, it's amazing. You were the only leading American figure who openly said, "Do not go to war in Iraq." They had almost, what, 90% votes in Congress for it, bipartisan. You said, "Don't do it. Iran will take over." I mean, look, you can say that today and everybody can say that, but you said that in 2001, 2002, 2003, when it was very unpopular, because you'd done your research and had good advisors. How did you know that when almost no one else did?
Well, first of all, I'm the most militaristic person there is. If I win, I'm gonna make our military so strong, so powerful that nobody's gonna mess with us. We're gonna take care of our vets and all of that. I have to tell you, you have to know if you're gonna go to war, you have to do it properly, and you have to know what to do. I viewed it as this. Iran and Iraq were the same in terms of strength, and they're constantly fighting. That's all they do is they fight. Right? They go to war all the time. They'd move 10 feet left, 10 feet right, 10 feet left, then they'd rest, and then they're started again four years... This has been gone on forever.
No. The French and the Germans are getting the oil, and the Iranians are getting the oil.
You know who the number-one customer for the oil is? Guess what? China.
That's right.
I mean how smart is China? They outsmart us on every level militarily. They outsmart us on trade. We have a $450 billion trade deficit with China.
Let me ask you this. You're a top business guy on your own from nothing. How did China get 97% of rare earth minerals in the world? How is the United States or nobody else even trying to get rare earth minerals when it's what goes in the smartphones, the computers? Trillions is made a year. How did we just give them the global market in that? That's crazy.
Well, what a lot of people don't know... Afghanistan. Now Afghanistan's a place we can go in because you have Pakistan and you have nuclear weapons and a lot of things going on there, but we go into Afghanistan, we're fighting tremendous mountains and ridges. We're fighting on one side, and you know who's got their excavators on the other side?
China.
China, taking out all the minerals. Nobody knew this, Afghanistan is rich with minerals, not oil, but minerals. They have-
You definitely have shown your knowledge of geopolitical systems. Hillary and others have been demonizing you for saying radical Muslims celebrated on 9/11, but she got caught a few years ago claiming that she got shot at in Bosnia in the air, on the ground, they have video of it all. None of it happened. She admits she lied. If you did that, you'd be done, but you wouldn't do something like that. You don't steal glory from our veterans, but they demonize you for made-up scandals every day trying to see what'll stick. Then you got Hillary involved in Benghazi. You've got them involved in everything. People love you for tough talk. Is it not time for impeachment hearings against Obama? I mean, what do we do politically to really try to prosecute Hillary Clinton?
Well, you remember this. The best thing that we have going with Obama is he's got a year left, OK, because by the time you do the hearings and everything, I don't-
Listen, I get it. I mean you are a true maverick. I understand. You've made tens of billions of dollars. You've hired tens of thousands of people. I mean I would imagine that as you've gotten older... Correct me if I'm wrong, because I know you talked about wanting to serve America decades ago. Really, all it comes down to is wanting to have a free country for your children and grandchildren, and that's where I want to come to this point next. Because I know you're smart, sir, and I know that you also, though... You don't dumb your message down, but you keep it at a mid-level so the general public and the establishment as well can get it, but let's get down to brass tacks.
OK.
I routinely talk to the top generals, Special Forces, Pentagon currently, out of the Pentagon, CIA, as I know you do. We'll just leave it at that. There are a lot of people in this government and also retired who don't want to destroy the country. They really know that we've reached the crossroads where the country's done as a third-world nation within a few more years. Forget Donald Trump in four years if this happens. We're done. I mean we're talking about resurrecting the dead here. We could turn it around right now as you've said properly. You're dead on, sir. You're right. We could turn it around. All the actuaries, all the numbers show it, but it's gotta happen in the next few years or we're done.
Right, right.
There are globalists that want to have a world government, a system run by select crony capitalists using socialism at the grass roots to make people dependent. I've talked to not just high-level folks that have been in government that are on your team, but separately high-level people in government currently that say there's an internal war going on and that you're a manifestation of that. I don't want to get anything inside baseball with you, but I already know the inside baseball. I know now from top people that you actually are for real, and you understand you're in danger, and you understand what you're doing is epic. It's George Washington level, and you understand that office. I want to tell you right now, can you speak about the war for the soul of this country that's happening right now and really tell people what's happening and commit to people that you won't Ross Perot under death threats and step down when you're in the lead two months from the election?
OK. Let me just tell you, Alex. As you know, I'm leading in every poll nationally in every poll state. I'm leading in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, the SCC, Texas. I'm leading in Texas, which I love. I love Texas. We were there. Mark Cuban called up. He said, "Do you wanna use the arena?" I used it. We filled it up in three or four days, 20,000 people. In Mobile, Alabama we had 35,000 people. We had 20,000 in Oklahoma. I'm so into this. I'm not into it for... I could do other things that I would enjoy doing, to be honest with you. It's not-
No. You're doing a dangerous mission. We understand that.
It's not an easy thing, but they key is make America great again. We can make America great again, but if you have to suffer through four more or eight more years of what's gone on in the past and what's... We're being eating away. It's eating away at our country. In my opinion, we can make America greater than ever before, but we have to get going. It has to happen. We have to get going. When you look at the vision, I said Iraq. You agreed with me on Iraq. I said, "Hit the oil." I said a lot of things that turned out to be true, 100% true. I'm given credit by some people. Some people refuse to acknowledge it. They refuse to say that-
What I'm asking is, though, can you speak to the crossroads we're at right now, though, because you've talked about it. Are we at a crossroads to decide whether this country's done or whether we go to the next level?
Well, I think this. Sadly, I think that if we don't get it right this time... I think this is gonna be the most important election our country's ever had. I mean, you'd have to say George Washington is right there, the couple of pretty important elections, right? In the modern era, this is the most important election our country's ever had. If we don't get it right, if we put another one of these people in like Hillary... I mean, she's so corrupt. She is so corrupt, and she shouldn't even be allowed to run. Frankly, her greatest legacy... She was a horrible Secretary of State. If she runs, I think her greatest legacy will be that she got out of the email scandal. That's what I think. It'll be one of the greatest jobs I've ever seen of getting out of a scandal, because General Patraeus and many others, I mean their lives have been destroyed for doing 5% of what she did.
That's right.
She shouldn't be allowed to run. The recent Fox poll that just came down two days ago has me beating her head-to-head, which is very interesting and very good, and beating her soundly head-to-head. We have to get it right. Our country can be absolutely... We can turn it around, but I would agree with you. If we don't get it right this time, I'm not sure if you go another four or eight years with the insanity and the stupidity of these leaders... I'm not sure you're gonna be able to turn it around anymore. I think it could be over.
Sure. You're not a loser. You don't get in mindless fights. You move forward with your agenda. Now you see America in trouble and you're, "Hey, that's all sideline now." Donald Trump's not working for Donald Trump. He wants to work for America.
Yeah. As a businessman, you couldn't have even functioned if you don't get along with these people.
No. I know.
Example, in New York City, it's 95% Democrat. I mean, if I didn't get along with the Democrats, I wouldn't have one building. I-
Mine, too.
I helped him. By the way, he was a Democrat. A lot of people don't know.
He was.
Somewhat of a liberal Democrat, Alex, as you know. He became a somewhat conservative... I wouldn't say the most conservative, but a somewhat conservative Republican.
He wanted to make America great.
He really did. He wanted to make... He had actually, "Let's make America great." That was his. Mine is, "Make America great again." There's a little bit of a difference, but-
My son finally sold me on being a bigger supporter of yours. I mean, I liked you, love Americana, you're pure Americana. My 13-year-old son's really smart, does a lot of research. He watches all the debates, and he just really loves you. He is on cloud nine that you're here, Rex Jones, and it was his question, "Which president was your favorite?" All-time, who's your favorite?
Well all-time, I'd say Ronald Reagan shorter term. I would say... Well, you look at Lincoln and you look at Washington. You have to go with... They are the classics, right Alex? You think in terms of the great classics, you have to go with the Lincolns and the Washingtons. One started-
That's my final question. What type of an elite wants a Cloward and Piven, bankrupt the country so socialists can run it, and we all get handouts? What type of an elite is that? I mean, you've been around these people. Are they mentally ill, Donald Trump?
Well, we have to make our country rich again. The other day I said to a woman to a... She come up to me, "Mr. Trump," at a big rally where we had 14,000 people. At the end, she just sees me and I'm signing autographs and stuff, and she said, "Mr. Trump, I'm voting for you 100%, but are you... This whole concept of making it rich, it sounds so crass." I said, "You know what? It might sound crass, but if we don't make our nation rich again, if we don't take back our jobs from all these other countries that are ripping us, and if we don't take back our money, and if we don't balance up our budget, at least get it damn close and soon, we're not gonna have a nation anymore."
That's how they deceive.
I said, "I want $5 million that will go to the Wounded Warriors," and they would play it. They even took the tape. The tape is worse than the pen. They can cut it, so they said, "Give me $5 million," and then they cut it. Nobody knows... What am I doing? I'm asking for money to be on a debate. It's ridiculous. No, I wanted $5 million to go to the Wounded Warriors in particular. Let's see what happens. I don't know. The one problem, Alex, if I didn't go to the debate, then you know what would happen. They'd say, "He's chicken." I mean, I think I won every debate. Every-
But it's true. I saw one channel made like $40 million of you being on there. They should give all of it to the vets.
Well, they should give a lot more than five, I'll tell you right now. The problem is if I say I won't do it, then the people that I'm debating, who frankly have been very easy, if you want to know the truth-
We can.
It's doing great business. I hope your audience goes out and buys it as Christmas gifts and everything else. I just want to finish by saying your reputation's amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope, and I think we'll be speaking a lot. You'll be looking at me in a year, in a year or two years. Let's give me a little bit of a time to run things, but a year into office you'll be saying, "Wow, I remember that interview. He said he was gonna do it, and he did a great job." You'll be very proud of our country.
Well, I'm impressed. I mean, you're saying you're fully committed. There's no future if we don't take this country back. Donald Trump, I hope you can help uncripple America. Thank you so much, sir. You will be attacked for coming on, and we know you know that. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
That's pretty chilling.
I say take them out.
Scary.
... and you see...
You said America is in decline...
You see the stupidity...
It's a lot of money.
So they're making a fortune. They should make a contribution to the wounded warriors, in my opinion. But I don't want to be accused ever, ever of being a chicken, right?
All right, Mr. Trump, good to see you, as always. Thank you for being with us. Trying times.
Thank you.
And we got to turn the country around. There's no doubt about it. Thank you for being here.
You're right. Thank you very much, Sean.
All right. If you were president, would you invest a lot of money in alternative energy to get away from fossil fuels and would you limit the amount of coal emissions and other industries into the air?
I want to get away from the Middle East. I want to get away from the monopoly that they once had and they still have to a certain extent. I want to be able to be self-sufficient to the country. Now due to the new techniques, things that we didn't even know about three or four years ago. It turns out we have virtually unlimited supply of fuel right under our feet due to fracking and many other techniques that frankly are very new. And we are able to take care of ourselves. I know a lot about wind. Wind is destroying a lot of problems, number one it's killing the birds. The birds and the eagles and you see what's happening in California with, you know, if you shoot an eagle, a bald eagle in California, they want to put you in jail. And, yet the windmills are killing them by hundreds.
So, you're not a -- of what's happening.
No. I'm not -- I'm not -- I think it's fine in certain locations. I think it's fine. The problem with the wind is it needs tremendous subsidy. Wind needs tremendous subsidy. So, I think wind is fine.
Would you invest government money in alternative fuels? Would you do that? Or would you just let it go?
I would spend money on certain things. Now, it always sounds better than it is. You know, you have 36 year pay back. I always want to go solar. I love the idea of solar and then I do a test and you get your money back in 36 years. The problem is, the panels destroy themselves after 10 years. So, it's just, you know, you have got to make it economically viable, Bill. Right now it's no economically viable.
And if it were, then somebody would be marketing it. That's for sure. Now this morning on "FOX AND FRIENDS" --
-- if you could to do.
OK.
It has to be viable. Yes.
So what does that mean? Are you going to have assassins roaming around shooting the families of the terrorists?
When the World Trade Center came down, the people that knocked it down, the terrorists that knocked it down, put their families on airplanes and sent them back home. Mostly to Saudi Arabia, believe it or not.
That was the Bin Laden Bush thing. Yes.
They put them. The Bin Laden disaster.
But would have you killed Bin Laden's family?
I would have done a very great destruction -- look, supposedly, they don't care about their own lives. I disagree with that they want to live, too.
All right. But you have to define to me, take out their families. What does that mean?
Bill, Bill. Do you think the wives and the families knew exactly what was going to happen with September 11th? I do and I know they did. Well, I do, I think they did.
So, when you say take out though. What does take out mean?
You have to do what Israel was doing for a period of time. Take out means that you have to wipe out their homes where they came from. You have to absolutely wipe them out. It's the only way you are going to stop terrorism. You have all these cells.
Would you kill the family members of terrorists? Would you have killed the Bin Laden family?
I don't want to be so bold. I want to tell you they would suffer. They know what was going on. If you look at what happened with these terrorists, they put their wives on the planes. Those wives knew exactly what was happening. The children, everybody knew. But they put their wives and families on those planes. They went home. They knew what was going to happen. They sat back and watched daddy on television.
Bin Laden had a lot of wives. And he had some relatives here. He is over in Afghanistan hatching a plot. I don't know if you can -- you know, I don't know. You can't really take them out.
We have to be, Bill, hey, Bill, we have to be much tougher than we are.
All right.
We're just not doing it right. We have to be much more vigilant and we have to be much tougher.
Do you remember what country that was?
Excuse me?
Do you remember what country that was?
It was a different country.
It was Turkey.
I'm just saying.
OK.
Yes. It was Turkey, I'm just saying. There is great hatred out there.
Nobody is disputing that.
And people are not acknowledging it.
Where you get in trouble, with all due respect, of course, is what you give a speech and you say things like I saw thousands and there weren't thousands.
But you don't know that there weren't, Bill. Bill, you don't know --
I was reporting. And believe me if there were thousands that would have been reported.
This article says they were swarming. Bill, this article says they were swarming all over the place.
All right.
So, I don't know what that means but it means a lot of people.
There were some people, not thousands. What I want to get at is this. You are giving a speech.
You don't know that Bill. Bill, you don't know that. Bill, you don't know that.
I'm pretty confident.
All right, you are pretty sure. You are pretty sure. You don't know that. This says swarming all over New Jersey.
You are not always right. So, you know, take it to the bank.
OK.
Why?
It's more exciting. You know, the other thing about it?
But you get into trouble.
I can talk about current events. I can talk about things that took place two hours ago. I can talk about a soccer game if it was played and people were screaming horrible things and it took place an hour before I go up.
OK.
And frankly, it's much more exciting to speak for the people for everybody even for me. But now --
I understand --
-- to do that, you need extraordinary memory and you need lots of ability to be able to speak in front of 20,000 people without a speech.
You have that.
I think it's much better.
But here's what happens, sometimes when you are up there, you get overly excited. And you're speaking extemporaneously. And then you say things as anybody would because a crowd is cheering and everything is going wild that you don't know to be true but you believe to be true. But you don't know it. So that's the risk as a president, all right? When you're out there is a man who wants the most powerful position in the world, you have got to be kind of be careful in those speeches because that's what gets you in trouble. Do you get my point?
I would love to read speeches off of a teleprompter. It is so easy to do. I would even love to read speeches -- but you know what? You don't get the same excitement. You don't get the same feeling and I haven't made very many mistakes that I can tell you. You know, when I talked about when I announced and when I talked about illegal immigration, all of a sudden everyone, I mean, the world went crazy and thought it was terrible. Four weeks later, I was number one in the polls because everyone realized I was right. In fact there was about one week later. But I was number one in the polls. And now I'm number one in every single poll. A big one, I hate to hear this. But a big one is coming out CNN tomorrow. I don't how it's going to be.
All right.
But I look forward to that one! But we are number one in every poll, including the FOX poll, very important.
All right. But I'm saying that --
-- and we beat Hillary. By the way, Bill, and we beat Hillary head to head.
All right. And I'm sure she is thrilled to that.
She is thrilled.
With the responsibility, OK, with the responsibility that you are seeking comes personal responsibility and when you say something, you have to be pretty damn well sure that attacker is not hyperbole. That's the point I'm trying to make and I'm sure you understand.
I have had very few complaints, Bill. I've had very few complains. And we get the biggest crowds by many, many times and we get far bigger crowds than anybody else.
That's because you're so charismatic.
We have a great -- you know what? We have a great time with a tough subject because there is not a lot of good news happening with the United States. You understand that better than anybody.
All right.
So we have a great time, as good as time as we can, with subject matter that's not so pleasant.
There are links between ISIS and this terror attack in San Bernardino, but there were no red flags. So, how do you stop this from happening again?
Well, I think there are red flags. And a lot of people knew what was going on in that house or that apartment. And people were not wanting to call because they thought it would be inappropriate to call.
Should there be profiling?
Well, I think there can be profiling.
There are three million Muslims in America.
Right.
But his sister said she didn't know what was going on. She was crestfallen for the victims here.
I probably don't believe the sister.
You don't believe the sister.
No.
So, you would go after her?
I would go after a lot of people, and I would find out whether or not they knew. I would be able to find out, because I don't believe the sister.
Should the good guys get guns?
The good -- well, I mean, the good guys...
In terms of stopping them, at the moment, if you're on the no-fly list, you can buy a firearm. Does that need to be fixed?
Well, I would certainly take a very look at it. I would. I'm very strongly into the whole thing with Second Amendment. But if you can't fly, and if you have got some really bad -- I would certainly look at that very hard.
Would you also look into -- the shooters in this case amassed a great amount of ammunition.
Right.
Yes.
We have to be looking at a lot of different things. But we can't do anything to hurt the Second Amendment. People need their weapons to protect themselves. And you see that now more than ever before.
Women in the military.
Right.
What is short term?
It could be very quickly if our country could get its act together. We don't know what's happening. We have a president that doesn't have a clue. We don't know what's happening. We need toughness and smartness and we have to do it quickly.
There are many, even in your own party, who think that ISIS is going to like your rhetoric. That your words are putting us in greater danger.
I'm the worst thing that's ever happened to ISIS. The people in my party fully understand that. They're running against me, for the most part they have no poll numbers. I'm leading by a lot. They get it. They're trying to get publicity for themselves. You know, when I came out against illegal immigration, everybody thought the same thing. Two weeks later, everybody was on my side, including the members of my own party.
Are you a bigot?
Not at all. Probably the least of anybody you've ever met.
Because?
Because I'm not. I'm a person who has common sense. I'm a smart person. I know how to run things. I know how to make America great again. This is about making America great again.
Right.
But look at Paris beyond that. Paris is no longer the beautiful, gorgeous city with all -- Paris has a tremendous -- lot of problems. They have areas in Paris that have been radicalized where the police refuse to go in and look at it.
We are well aware. But Mr. Trump, here's the point.
Wait a minute, Chris. You're well aware. You say that so routinely. You're well aware.
They have heightened awareness. They do not have fear and they're not acting out of it, that's why they're letting in refugees --
Come on. They don't have fear? Of course they have fear.
It's how you behave in that environment.
I have people that have friends living in Paris. They want to leave, they're petrified.
But what are they doing? Are they banning all Muslims?
Well, let's see, maybe they're going to have to. Maybe they're going to have to do something.
That's not even on table.
Look -- I'm talking about a temporary situation until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on, Chris. We have to figure it out.
The timing is irrelevant.
Listen, we had the World Trade Center No. 1, we had World Trade Center No. 2, we had many other things happen. Then the other day we had the California attack where these two animals, they're total animals, they became radicalized and they wanted to do far more damage than that. What's even more disturbing in terms of looking into the future, is other people knew what they were doing. There were pipe bombs laying all over the floor. They had other people that knew what was going on, Chris, and nobody reported it. They used the excuse they didn't want to be racial profilers. They wanted to be politically correct. By the way, the people that said that, I think in their own way, they're guilty. The mother knew, the parents knew. Everybody knew. Now even his father is under watch. They just found out.
You use politically correct. This isn't about being politically correct.
Chris, we can be nice -- We can be politically correct, but we have a problem in this country --
This isn't about being politically correct.
-- and we should solve I because you could have many more World Trade Centers if you don't solve it. Many, many more and probably beyond the World Trade Center.
I don't see the point of scaring people with the possible when the reality is we haven't had another World Trade Center. You and I both lived through it. We both lost people there. We know what the real deal is. We know who celebrated and we didn't. We know what's scaring people and what the reality is. We haven't had those kind of attacks. The security network has held up. One of the reasons is our unity as a people. I don't understand how you can see banning an entire religion as a way of saying anything other than we are what ISIS says we are. We want a war against Islam. That's who America is. And as you know, or you should know, that is not who America is, Mr. Trump.
Chris, we are at war with radical Islamic terrorism.
Look -- Everybody knows who we're at war with.
They are looking to do great damage. You look at what's going on in the Middle East, they are chopping off heads, they are looking to come over to other places, too. And they want the jihad. It's very simple. They want the jihad.
I know, you're going to disparage whoever criticizes you and I'm waiting for that as well. But here's the point --
They polled from the center for security policy, released data showing 25 percent of those polls agree. Now these are Muslims living in the United States.
Yeah.
25 percent of the Muslims living in the United States agreed that violence against Americans here in the United States is justified as part of the global jihad.
Donald, we wouldn't even put that poll on the air. It's a hack organization with a guy who was dismissed from the conservative circles for conspiracy theories. You know that. It's as bad as those cop stats --
No, it's not. And you know why? Take a look at the Pew poll. Take a look at the Pew poll. The Pew poll was the same thing, highly respected, and the Pew poll had terrible numbers, too. But listen to this, go a step further.
Please.
51 percent of those polled agreed that Muslims in America should have a choice of being governed under the Sharia. Now, if you're talking about horrible stuff here, Chris. Now we can close the eyes, we can put the blinders on, but I don't choose to do that. Now, is it temporary? Yes. It's until the country's representatives can figure out what is going on. Our country's representatives cannot figure it out. Now, the problem I have with that is, they couldn't even build a website for Obamacare after spending $5 billion. So how do they figure anything out? They can't figure anything out.
That's not fair. That's not fair.
Well, it's true.
Our security network is the best in the world. If you ask people who are in the business of keeping us safe, they say the idea of banning Muslims does nothing to help and everything to hurt. They're the experts. That's what they say. They think this idea is stupid.
Until -- well, when you say that -- so I spoke before an audience last night of a massive audience last night. Your people were there. Thousands of people inside, thousands of people outside. They couldn't even get in. And got standing ovations as soon as this was mentioned. Standing ovations.
Of course you did, Mr. Trump. These are your people.
Well, I mean, I have standing ovations from very smart people. These are intelligent people, these are great citizens. These are people that are concerned about our country. Until our country's representatives can figure it out. Now --
Chris Christie, Jeb Bush --
When they figure it out. But they've got to figure it out.
The heads of the party in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, they all say this is wrong.
Because you guys have a tendency to call these guys -- they're not masterminds, they're not even smart people. You have --
I didn't call them masterminds, by the way.
-- and you're building them up and then you wonder why kids want to go into ISIS. The fact is until our people can do something about these horrible people that want to do damage to our country, real damage to our country, then I think it stays in place. But it's temporary until we can figure that out.
But you have just about all of your rivals except Rand Paul, and even that's qualified, they all reject this notion. Your party leaders reject this notion.
I don't care about them. Look, look, look --
Who do you care about?
I've been a politician for six months.
Do you have to impress anybody but yourself with these ideas?
I'm doing what's right. I don't care. I mean maybe --
How do you know what's right to exempt an entire class of people, a religion?
I only know this --
How is that right? How can it be right?
We have people out there -- Excuse me, Chris, can I talk for two seconds?
Please, go ahead. But I want you to tell me why it's right in America.
Can I talk for two seconds, Chris?
OK. Here's my question to you. I heard Jeffrey Lord. We're always happy to have him on the show. He makes your case well, no question about that.
He makes his own case well, in all fairness. It wasn't my case.
Well -- fine. And he certainly owns it.
To be honest with you, what Franklin Delano Roosevelt did was worse.
Here is the distinction. One, the United States was at war and he was targeting sovereigns he was at against. The second thing is it was wrong then, it was wrong with the Japanese, and it is wrong now.
Excuse me, you don't think we're at war?
We are at war, but not with all of Islam.
We don't have a president that knows what it is --
When you say -- You're making it worse.
We don't have a president that can use the term. Chris --
That's fine criticism.
We are at war.
You can criticize him. The reason that he won't say Islamic terrorism --
Of course I'll criticize him, he's an incompetent president. Chris --
The reason he says it --
We are at war. Get it through your head.
All right. Yeah, I understand what you're saying, believe me, I live it. We go to these places and cover these things. We understand the threat very well and you know that because you get a lot of your information from us, as you tell us. So -- I get it.
Why do we insist on destroying our country? Why do we -- Why are we allowing Syrians --
What destroys America?
Who we don't even know where they are, we don't know where they're coming from. There's no documentation, there's no paperwork. Why do we insist on destroying our country?
Make the system better. But what tears at America's fabric more than rejecting an entire faith in the land of religious freedom?
Chris, let me ask you this. You have a large portion of people from Syria that are Christian. Why aren't we allowing the Christians in? We only allow the Muslims in.
That's not true.
Why aren't we allowing the Christians?
That's just not true. Does it matter to you that it's not true?
It is largely true because the percentage is massively in favor of the Muslims.
You have a massive Muslim population.
Excuse me, Chris, the ones that are in the bigger danger are the Christians. They're the ones having their heads chopped off.
Christians are in trouble? They are being allowed into the refugee program?
We are not allowing the Christians into anywhere near the extent that we should be.
Yeah, you know why? Because people like you say Syrian refugees shouldn't come into the country. How can you say let the Syrian Christians in, but you don't want to let Syrian refugees in?
No, we should not let them in because we don't know who they are, we don't know where they are, we don't know if they're ISIS, we don't know if they're a Trojan horse.
So you care about the Syrian Christians, but not enough to let them in.
Let me ask you this. If we're letting in, why aren't we letting the Christians in? Why are we letting the Muslims?
You tell me. You're saying no. You're the one saying on. You tell me. Why aren't we letting them in?
Well, I guess Obama set a policy or something.
No, he didn't set a policy. He is letting them in.
There must have been a policy set by somebody in the administration.
No -- that's just not true. It's just not true.
If you happen to be a Christian in Syria, it's almost impossible to come into this country. If you're a Muslim, you can get in. You explain, why is that, Chris?
That is a mythology. They're going, they're doing operations by the hundreds. They're getting a handle on the situation. But most importantly, they're staying together. I think that your poll data actually reflects a responsibility on you, Mr. Trump, because people are listening to you and America is great because it is united. Our diversity is our greatest string.
But you know what? They're listening to me because I have commonsense. That's why. Because most of these politicians were not born with business ability --
This doesn't sound like commonsense to a lot of people.
-- and that's why I'm doing well. I have commonsense. I know what has to be done. We don't want have a situation like Paris and we don't want to have another World Trade Center which, by the way, they tried to knock down twice. The first time they were unsuccessful. We don't want that, Chris. We need intelligence in this country. We need a certain toughness in this country or we'll end up like a lot of other places and we're not going to have a country left.
The fear is real, there's no question about it. Mr. Trump, thank you for coming on NEW DAY, as always, to make the case. We know that you're fighting with your throat so thank you for making the effort. Appreciate it.
Thank you very much.
The best to you.
Thank you.
Joining us now, Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump. Donald, good morning.
Good morning.
Donald?
Yes.
I mean, almost every high ranking member of the Republican Party and candidates, they're all condemning your plan and your comments. Do you see what's happening?
Well, they've been condemning practically everything I say and then they come to my side. They were condemning the wall, they were condemning illegal immigration, they were condemning all of the things I've been espousing. And now most of them are on my side. And the ones that aren't on my side are down to about 0 in the polls and they're not going to go anywhere.
But do you -- but Donald -- Donald.
I see a couple of people that have said they would come out. But you know, many of the people -- and not everybody has condemned it, if you really look. I don't want to get into names but not everybody has condemned.
I understand you're not afraid of controversy. But what about the Muslim community --
Mika, this has nothing to do about controversy --
Donald, what about --
When I announced illegal immigration, I took more heat than I'm taking right now.
I understand that. I understand that.
And everybody now agrees with me in one form or another.
All right, Donald.
One other thing --
You know, hold on, Donald. You got let us ask questions. You can't just talk. No, you got to let us actually ask questions. You're just talking.
I'm not just talking.
Donald, Donald, Donald, you're not going to keep talking. We will go to break if you keep talking. We're going to ask you questions.
Go to break, then, Joe. All I'm doing is giving you the facts, and you don't want to hear the facts.
I agree with that, Donald.
Right.
Donald, it's Willie.
Hi Willie.
Where is that, Donald?
Paris. Look at Paris.
Where in Paris?
Take a look at the radicalized areas, the Muslims areas in Paris. Joe, the police won't go there.
What, where? Where, though? Where are you hearing that?
Oh, it's all over. I mean, it's all over the place. I know Paris. I mean, it's all over the place. You take a trip to Paris sometime, Joe, and enjoy yourself.
Well, you know, I hardly ever get out of the Scanve County in Florida. But when I do, I'll look at Paris. I might go to Staten Island instead.
I'll go to Staten Island.
Do you know what parts of Paris specifically? Since you visited there?
I can get you the information. Joe, it's well known, well documented. I will get you the information.
Do you -- this is Nicolle.
Hi, Nicolle.
Hi.
I hope your father still likes me.
So Donald, I agree with you on that, too. But let me ask you this. A week or so ago, you said that you've got Muslim-American friends, that Muslims are good people. Do you still believe that, this week, that most Muslims are good, wonderful people?
Oh yes, I do. And I do have friends and, by the way, my friends agree with me. My friends say that when they become radicalized, they become different people.
Right, but --
Hey Joe --
You know, you and I both know if we're going to win the war against ISIS and if we're going to stop terror in America, we have to make sure the Muslim-American community is on our side. It's like community policing. You've seen -- my gosh, you were tough on crime in New York City in the 1980s. You took out full-page ads and then you had Giuliani, Bloomberg, and others coming together and they did community policing. So if you see something, you report something.
I've always been tough on crime.
Don't we reach out to them?
I want them to be on our side, Joe. I hope they are on our side. Many people knew what was going on in that thug's apartment. Many people. You had -- I watched the sister being interviewed. I think she's lying.
Is that the Frank Gaffney poll?
What?
Is that the Frank Gaffney poll?
That's the Gaffney poll and they have a Pew Research poll.
Mr. Trump, Dick Cheney is not running for president and I don't think he's considered a guy who's political correct. He described what you're proposing as standing -- goes against everything we stand for and believe in. What do you think he means for that and do you have any sympathy for that point of view?
Well, I mean, I have sympathy for everything. I mean, I understand all points of view. I'm just saying that I know how to get things done and we're not getting it done. If we continue to go in the path that we're doing, we're losing to ISIS in the war because we have a president that doesn't know how to fight the war. We have a president that doesn't even know what to call the terrorists.
So you agree this goes against --
Hey Joe, nobody knew this guy was radicalized. His wife probably radicalized him.
You agree this goes against American values?
Well, no, because FDR did it, if you look at it. I mean, they said the same thing when I said we have to do strong borders. I did, then they looked back in 1954, Dwight Eisenhower, I like Ike, his thing was I like Ike, everybody liked Ike. He did it. So you know --
Did the Japanese internment camps go against American values?
We have to be smart, Mark, and we have to be vigilant. And if we're not going to be smart and vigilant, and honestly we also have to be tough.
Did the internment -- did the interment --
And if we're not going to be those three things, we're not going to have a country left.-
Did the internment of the Japanese violate American values?
We're not talking about internment; this is a whole different thing.
I understand, but I'm just asking you to weigh in on that.
No, no, this is a whole different thing. You're asking me a different question. Don't ask me that question.
I'm asking you that question. Did the Japanese internment camps violate --
OK, now let me ask you this --
Did the Japanese internment camps violate your sense of American values?
Mark, what about Franklin Roosevelt's presidential proclamations 2525, 2526, and 2527? Take a look at it, Mark.
Just ask you one more -- did the Jap -- did the internment of Japanese-Americans violate your sense of American values? Yes or no?
I don't want to respond to it. You know why? That's not what we're doing.
I understand.
You're asking me a different question. That's not what we're doing.
But for some people the same values are at stake.
But that's an entirely -- Mark. That's -- it's wonderful that you ask me that. That's an entirely different question. It has no relationship to what I'm talking about.
Donald, your campaign has changed.
Gene, I hope you still write well about me.
Donald, you can't generalize from this one incident and say that Muslims aren't helping law enforcement officers across America, because they are.
I don't think they are much, Joe. They are to a very little extent, but not nearly to the extent that -- I mean, look, not nearly to the extent that they should be.
Donald, I want to go back to your -- what you call temporary shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. I get the concept but I want to know how does it work practically. How does it work at the border? Let's say a man and his family want to travel --
We just shut -- Willie, Willie.
Donald, I understand that and you've made that point. But I just want to know how it works. Religion doesn't appear on a passport. Would there be questioning at the border in Europe before they got to the United States? Would it happen here in America? How would this work?
It could happen at the site, it could happen here, it could happen at many different forums, Willie. That would have to be worked out, and I don't think it would be for an extended period of time. We have to get our hands around this situation.
And if they said yes, they would not be allowed in the country?
That's correct.
Mr. Trump, I gather you're supposed to attend a Republican National Committee fund-raiser tomorrow and now you're not. Are you not going? And if not, why not?
I don't know. I honestly don't know anything about it. I'm funding my own campaign, so I don't need money to put it mildly. So I don't know anything about a fund-raiser tomorrow. I mean, Mark, I'm funding my own campaign.
I just want to say, this is a fund-raiser for the Republican Party. It was announced that you were attending.
I don't know if I'm going or not. I have no idea. I didn't know it was on my schedule, frankly. All I know is I'm funding my own campaign. I'm not getting money from the special interests, from the lobbyists, and from the donors. Like every other candidate.
You were ahead in that CNN poll and many other polls.
No, no, no, not ahead, Mark. How much ahead was I, Mark?
Way ahead. Mr. Trump, you are way ahead in the polls. You could become the Republican nominee, you could become our future president. How do you think your first meetings with leaders of, say, the United States Arab Emirates, where they're a superb ally, they're flying missions over ISIS, they have women in their army. How do you think those meetings would go after you had proposed -- and it sounds like you have ideas for implementing a policy like this?
I think I'll get along great with them. I've always been a unifier. I've even gotten along with Joe and Mika for years. If you could do that, you could do anything.
This is true.
And frankly, I think --
But really, you don't think you'd create any --
By the way, Nicolle, you know who is not a unifier is President Obama. He's a disaster. He's the most -- the greatest divider I've ever seen.
I don't disagree with you -- But you don't see any --
I am a unifier.
So you'd waive the ban for the leaders of Middle Eastern countries to let them in?
Of course I would. Yes, of course.
So from 1945 to 1991, Donald, we were engaged in a cold war where the actual -- the balance of the -- the human race hung in the balance. We feared nuclear war. We still let Russians come to America, though, despite the fact that the danger was actually greater. If you looked at the cold war and mutually assured destruction. If we had banned Russians from emigrating to this country, coming to this country, we wouldn't have Google. We wouldn't --
Well, no, I'm not looking at that, Joe. Joe, take a look back at Roosevelt and take a look about the alien Germans. They called them alien Germans, alien Italians, alien Japanese. Because we were at war, Joe -- we're at war right now, whether you like it or not, we are at war with radical Islam right now.
But the difference between you and me though is I want to --
The president doesn't agree with you.
-- get as many Muslims on our side as possible and it seems to me that your approach divides Muslim-Americans and don't make them feel like they have a stake in the American dream. I believe -- and you look, there are six to -- I think Muslim-Americans have buying power of about $100 billion in this country. There are great entrepreneurs that are Muslim-Americans, law-abiding Muslim-Americans, they actually employ tens of thousands of Americans. I want them on our side. I want Muslims across the world on our side.
Joe, so do I. But you said it will divide. They are already divided, Joe.
They, you say they.
The Muslim-Americans.
Who? Five percent, 10 percent.
Joe, Joe --
If we have 90 percent, don't we want -- I mean, you -- you're great at making deals. You understand, you make deals by drawing people in and getting as many people on your side. It seems to me the last thing you want to do is divide the very people that we need to focus on --
Joe, by doing this, you ultimately will draw them in.
-- to be on our side. If Muslims are on our side in America and across the world, we win this war against ISIS.
Joe -- We're not winning anything right now. That I can tell you.
No, we're not.
Do you think we're winning against ISIS?
I just said no, we're not. I'm talking about how we win the war ultimately.
OK. Joe, we will win by being firm, by being tough, by being smart, and we will draw them in. Right now we're not drawing them in. Right now -- things are going on right now that you don't know about, that I don't know about, that nobody -- right now there are things going on that you have so-called people that you think are on our side and they're not reporting it, they're not talking about it, and in some cases they're involved with it. I mean, look, I'll give you an example. Some of our so-called allies that we work with and we protect and we protect them militarily, they're sending massive amounts of money to ISIS and to Al-Qaeda and to others, OK?
Who are you talking about there?
You know who it is. Why do I have to bring it up for? You know who it is.
Well, because you're running for president.
Other countries. Hey Joe -- Joe, other countries are giving massive amounts of money. People from other countries are giving massive amounts of money.
Right, so who -- Are you saying the Saudis are doing this?
Of course they're doing it. Everybody knows that.
OK. Any other countries?
There are but I'm not going to say it because I have a lot of relationships with people, but they are. And you know that and everybody knows that and nobody says it. Nobody talks about it.
Well, but you're not even saying the countries that are doing it right now. Why aren't you willing to name those -- You say you have a lot of relationships there.
Hey, Joe, all you have to do is check your records and our government knows the countries and one of them happens to be Saudi Arabia and our government knows that and why aren't we doing anything about it? Why aren't we being firm as to why are we allowing that to happen?
So why don't you think we are doing anything about it?
Because I think we have an incompetent president.
So let me ask you this. It looks right now like the rest of the Republican candidates are divided against you. If you get to the convention, and let's say there's --
Joe, that's been from the beginning.
All right. So let's say there's a broker convention and you go in with the most delegates. If they don't will you the domination, will you break away from the Republican Party and run as an independent?
I can't tell you that, Joe. I signed a pledge for fairness and I assume they're going to live up to that. I think that I'm going to win the nomination in terms of popular support. You know, I'm very popular. And you know, the poll that came out yesterday in Iowa, the poll that came out two days ago, it sort of indicates that very strongly. Way ahead in every category. Every state and their --
So let's turn page from politics really quickly. I want to talk policy. Right now Ted Cruz is taking two different tacks on the fight against ISIS. One seems to be that he wants to carpet bomb them until the sand glows. But he's reluctant to say that he wants to send ground troops in. After San Bernardino, do you believe that the United States needs to send more ground troops in as part of an international force to take ISIS' land away from them?
OK, here's what I'd do. I'd knockout the capital and I'd knock it out big and strong. I'd take over the oil and I'd keep the oil.
All right. So you need ground troops to do that.
I've been saying that for three years.
Right. But you need ground troops to do that?
Yes, you'll need some ground troops. Yeah. You'll need ground troops.
What do you think? 10,000, 20,000? Do you have a number?
Listen, Joe, I'm not giving them back the oil. I'm keeping the oil. There's a big difference.
OK. I understand. So I think we have Ted Cruz coming on later this week. I'm going to be asking him specifics on how we defeat ISIS because we're not winning, I agree with you right now, and we have to defeat ISIS --
The only way you're going to beat ISIS, Joe, is to take their financing away, to take their money away. And the way you're going to do that is by banking and by knocking out their oil.
So -- I want to get specific with you like I will with Ted Cruz and everybody else because I think people need to start giving us specifics on how we get there.
Well, I've been specific.
So 10,000 troops --
Joe, Joe --
I'm talking specifically about ground troops --
Joe, I've been more specific than any other candidate.
All right, Don. So I'm trying to drill down a little bit because we're not going to win by carpet bombing, as some candidates say. So would you support taking it, say, ten thousand ground troops as part of an international force?
I want to knock out their capital and I want to knock out the oil and I want to take over the oil and I want to ring it so that the oil is safe and we're going to take the oil and we're going to give some of the profits of the oil to our wounded warriors and to our veterans and to the families of the people whose family and whose sons and daughters died in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Syria.
Agreed. That sounds great. So how many troops? 10,000 maybe? Would you support 10,000 ground troops?
I would. Yes, I would.
All right. And who -- do you -- would you be comfortable, just again, we need to figure out how to do this moving forward. Would you be comfortable with those troops with, say, Russia and when you brought up the Saudis as part of a bigger international force in Syria and Iraq?
Yes, I would.
OK.
I would. I think it's wonderful if Russia wants to drop bombs on ISIS. Anybody who wants to drop bombs on ISIS, I'm all for them.
All right. So let's go to domestic politics. Ted Cruz is ahead in one poll in Iowa. You're ahead in all the others. Is Ted Cruz right now your main competitor for the Republican nomination?
I don't think so. He might be, but I really don't think so.
Ben Carson down 19 points in the latest Monmouth poll. I said that seemed to me that -- the headline -- is Ben Carson finished as a prospective Republican nominee?
Well, I think he's a very nice man. I like him very much. Yes, I think he's finished as a nominee.
All right. Who is your greatest competition right now?
Well, I don't want to say, but I don't think -- You know, look, I don't know if I have anybody. I'm so far ahead. I mean I watch you too. I don't think really I have anybody. I'm leading in every poll. I'm doing great in South Carolina -- You ought to see the crowd last night in South Carolina.
We saw it.
Largest crowd in the history of that ship.
What is -- Final thoughts. What's your final -- here's your opportunity as the guy who right now is the highest ranking Republican, certainly -- obviously grabbing most headlines and have the highest polls -- what's your message to Muslim-Americans right now as we conclude this interview?
We love you, we want to work with you, we want you to turn in the bad ones, we want you to practice vigilance. We know that you know a lot in many cases. We want you to turn in the bad ones. We all want to get along. We want to get back to a normal, peaceful life.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Right.
The people that you interview on the street -- you know, they had one network yesterday that went out looking for people, and they wanted to find people. They couldn't find anybody against me!
Yes, but you didn't answer my question, what would you do to Muslims overseas vis-a-vis coming to the U.S.A.?
I would -- I would -- number one, I'd try and get to the bottom of what's going on --
All right, but that's really, you know --
-- as to what's happening --
-- that would be --
-- with the Muslim population.
-- I assume --
-- but it would be -- it would be something that has to be done.
All right. I assume that if you were president, the goal is to defeat the jihad, is that correct? That's the goal?
Yes. Correct.
All right.
Correct.
Now, would you cede, as I said last night, that you need Arab-Muslim nations to help the United States defeat the jihad? Would you cede that?
No, I don't. But I do think they would be --
You don't?
-- very helpful and -- no. But I do think it would be very, very helpful.
All right, well, how does it help, then, if you say to the King of Jordan, you and all your people can't come here for a while, until I sort it out? Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Egypt, their government is cooperating against ISIS with us. Turkey, their government is letting us land planes there. How is that helpful to ban people from all of those countries from coming here? It doesn't seem to be helpful --
Bill, what --
-- to defeating the jihad.
-- when you say -- when you say their governments are letting us, we are paying a very big price to have governments let us do anything.
-- come here --
-- excuse me.
-- nations. You can't insult them like that.
I disagree.
You can't.
Bill, I disagree. People have to be vetted. They have to be perfectly --
You can vet them, but you can't insult --
-- vetted. We have to know who's coming in --
-- the whole religion.
We're not insulting. This is about security, it's not about religion. This is about security. We cannot allow people to come into this country that have horrible things in their minds.
All right, everybody agrees with that.
There's something going on.
-- something for you --
Bill?
Go ahead.
I thought through everything --
Go ahead.
-- believe me.
All right. OK.
I thought through everything. Look at what's happening. I thought through everything. And, again, I've had calls from friends of mine who happen to be Muslim --
All right.
-- saying you're the only one with the courage. Bill, they said you're the only one with the courage to say it. They all know what I'm saying is true.
We want to win the war against ISIS and the jihad.
Correct.
You've got to enlist --
That is correct.
Let's keep it here.
-- I said don't do it.
All right. So you reject that Cheney and the speaker and all of that criticism by saying --
Well --
-- this is bad --
-- just so you understand.
All right --
The establishment is very upset.
They don't like you, OK. Well, I -- I know how that is.
No, I would say probably not.
The establishment doesn't like me, either.
And you know how it is.
OK, and that's why --
And I want to make America great again.
OK, we're back to the first --
All of these things are going to happen.
-- announcement now.
Don't smile, it's going to happen.
OK, but --
I'm winning in South Carolina.
If you don't --
I'm winning in New Hampshire big.
If you don't.
OK, I'll -- if I'm treated fairly, I would never do it. If I'm not treated fairly, I might very well do it.
All right -- if you do it --
My deal was --
-- it's President Clinton.
-- my deal was I have to be treated fairly.
All right.
Well, who knows? But my deal was I have to be treated fairly. If the Republicans treat me fairly, the so-called establishment, of which I was a member about seven months ago, you understand that, right? Once I decided to run, I was no longer a member of the establishment.
How are you?
I'm very good. Thank you.
You're always doing something. You're always leading the conversation, don't you think?
Well, it seems to be, it seems to be.
Let's talk about the polls because you love the polls, right?
I love them.
We released three national polls last week, the three polls last week. The national poll, Iowa, and New Hampshire -- you are ahead by far...
Right.
But you know a lot of people are unhappy with you. You're getting -- you're getting a lot of criticism, you're even getting criticism from your own party, from Reince Preibus, from...
I'm getting criticism from people that are running against me that have no poll numbers. I mean, they're doing very poorly. I see Jeb Bush and this one and that one, and they're criticizing me, although Jeb Bush actually said some very good things about me the other day. Did you hear?
Fiance visa.
She had a fiance visa.
We'll talk more in-depth about that, but let's -- I want to stick with the -- your critics in the party, because they believe, and I don't know if you do, this may be, they say it may be good for your brand but it's bad for the republican brand. Are you concerned about that? What do you think of that?
Well, they don't believe anything. They believe what's good for them. They don't believe -- they don't care about, they don't care about anything else.
Do you think it's damaging for the Republican Party?
No, I think it's actually going to be an asset ultimately. Just like illegal immigration was an asset, I think it's going to be an asset ultimately.
OK. I just want this plain-spoken for the viewer.
Go ahead.
What do you mean when you say, if they break this pledge, then you'll break the pledge? What do you mean by that?
Well, if they don't treat me with a certain amount of decorum and respect. If they don't treat me as the frontrunner, by far the frontrunner. If the playing field is not level, then certainly all options are open. But that's nothing I want to do.
How will you know that? What determines that?
Well, I think I'll know that over a period of a number of months. We'll go through the primaries, we'll see what happens and I'll make a determination. But I would imagine they would treat me properly because I'm leading by a lot.
So, the pledge is you keep your word if they keep their word.
Hey, Don, I want to run as a republican.
OK.
I'm a republican, I'm a conservative. I've had just tremendous bonding. But you saw the poll that came out in U.S.A. Today that 68 percent of the people would follow me and it's a much higher number if you say sort of follow me.
OK.
But just so you understand, that's nothing I want to do. I want to do it just the way I'm doing it. I want to win Iowa, I want to win New Hampshire, I want to win South Carolina, I want to win the SEC, I want to win Nevada, I want to win the whole group. And potentially I have the capability, and I think I have the numbers to run the table. You know what running the table is.
Yes. I know -- I know what you mean by running the table.
I mean, let's see.
Let's just say you had to run as an independent. Do you think you could win?
I think it would be much tougher to win as an independent. I think I could win, but I think it would be much tougher to win as an independent. I'd rather not do that.
Maybe Rubio, maybe Ted Cruz is...
I don't think it would matter.
It was a 30's, a double digit lead over the next person.
Right. They don't even say that anymore because I seem to go up all the time. I think I'll go up again. But just so you understand, when you're at 35 or 42 and you have 15 people, that's a tremendous number.
We are just getting started. Much more ahead of my one-on-one with Donald Trump. A lot of people are leveling a very serious charge at him, so I asked him about it. Are you racist?
I am the least racist person that you have ever met. I am the least racist person.
So, then how would you -- but how would stop that, then, because you're talking about immigration?
Well, she came in, she came in and probably radicalized him. She came in. She went to a school. People that knew her said she was very radical, and she came in, OK? It's a problem. It's a problem.
OK.
There will certainly be exceptions made.
Yes.
We have to find out why.
What were you expecting?
He didn't say anything.
What would you have said?
Well, I would have expected a little more vim and vigor, and we're going -- I mean, it was -- it was like -- it was like just another day at the office.
But don't you think the president is damned if he does, damned if he doesn't?
No. No.
Yes.
And one of the things, frankly, I don't like talking about it. Because if I win, I have a good chance. If I win, I want to be unpredictable. I don't want the enemy to know. I have been saying hit the oil for three years, including on your program if you look back. They said, no, no, no. Now everybody agrees with me, hit the oil.
The thing that you tweeted out about crime. They thought that was an insult to African-Americans.
That was a re-tweet sent to me and it was just a re-tweet.
You don't have to relocate it.
All right.
But you talked about it was a re-tweet. Let's say why would they send it out.
I didn't make that up. It was a re-tweet.
Here's my question. I asked you last time. I said and people -- some people were shocked. If you were racist. You knew why I was asking you that. Are you racist?
I am the least racist person that you have ever met. I am the least racist person.
Are you bigoted in any way?
I don't think so. No, I don't think so.
Islamophobic?
I'm a person -- no. I'm a person who happens to be very smart, and I happen to have a certain street sense, and I know where things are going. I said, take out Osama Bin Laden in a book written in the year 2000 called "The America We Deserve." I said, you better be careful, because I saw this guy Osama Bin Laden probably on television. I said, take him out. He knocked down the World Trade Center.
OK. So, here's what my Muslim friends say. You say you have lots of Muslim friends and they agree with you on this.
I have Muslim partners.
OK.
I do deals with them.
And we have said that that wasn't right.
I don't care if you said it wasn't right. He did it.
OK. You said you don't want -- you want to talk straight. But sometimes the language, do you think sometimes the language and the tone might incite some sort -- incite hysteria or some sort of Islamophobia and that the person who are the leader of the country should calm people rather than incite them?
Well, what about our president? Our president is the greatest divider I've ever seen.
But I mean...
Our country -- excuse me. Our country has never been more divided than what Barack Obama has done. Whether it's white on black, whether it's -- our country has never been more divided. If you talk about...
How so, what do you mean? What do you mean?
Well, just take a look. Take a look at what's going on. Our country has never been this way. Look at the riots that we have, the horrible things taking place in Ferguson, St. Louis, Baltimore, all over the country.
And that's the president's fault, do you think?
Well, I would have thought that he would have been a great healer. I would have thought that he was -- and I've said this that he was going to be a great cheerleader.
But aren't you saying what I'm saying?
I didn't think he would be -- by the way, excuse me. I didn't think he would be a great president, but I thought he was going to be a great cheerleader. He's been a horrible cheerleader.
But aren't you're saying -- you're saying that the president supposed to be the healer? That's what I'm saying to you. That's what exactly what I'm saying to you.
Remember this, if I win, you -- you would have me in two years or three years, you will say, I cannot believe it. You were a healer. You were somebody that brought people together. People don't think of me that way, but I think it's one of my biggest strengths.
So, Mr. Trump, when you come up with these policies, I thought last one and others, who is -- who is advising you on television?
I have many people. I have many people.
Yes. But when you went to -- you went to Wharton, correct?
I went to the Wharton of Finance.
So, Wharton School of Finance in Philadelphia.
Right.
Meaning people close to these people.
I'm talking about people that live next to them. They saw the bombs, they showed the pipe bombs sitting all over the floor. They had many of them all over the floor. Why didn't they call the police?
No parameters, no restrictions.
They're always going to be able to get a gun.
Mr. Trump, you know, when you say that, you know, I will give you that the people who, law-abiding citizens, people who use guns properly, mostly they're not committing the gun crimes. But when people hear what you're saying, they hear wild, Wild West. Everyone has a gun.
No, it's not Wild West. No, Wild West is when people can come in and do the kind of damage to people that are totally unprotected. To me that's the danger. When they can have guns and other people can't, that's the danger.
OK. You said that you would consider a database for Muslims, registering Muslims, that you would survey a mosque, on and on and on. You've talked about it in this interview.
OK.
Where else would you go in regards to Muslim-Americans?
I would look at where they are and where the problem is. And by the way, if it's not Muslims, if it's another group, I would look at them, too. I'm about safety. I want safety for this country. I want safety for our citizens. They deserve it. They deserve it. And they're not getting it.
What about the refugees? You're against getting bringing them in, right?
Absolutely I'm against it, because we have no idea where they came from. It could be the ultimate Trojan horse. Don, we have no idea where they came from. And I've watched experts and I have spoken to experts in law enforcement, there is absolutely no way, if some guy is standing there and he doesn't have papers and you don't know him, there is no way you can ever find out where he's from, where's his papers. There's no way.
You have -- you have big business interests in the Middle East.
Yes.
Yes.
And when that problem is solved, it's going to be a much happier world.
So Time magazine, Angela Merkel now is the person of the year. Everyone thought it would be you. I'm sure you probably thought it should be you.
I did.
I would have to ask you, I would be reticent if I didn't ask you this. You say you're going to meet with Benjamin Netanyahu when you visit him them?
I didn't say that, no. I have respected him. I actually did a commercial for him for his campaign. He has been a dual commercial. I like him a lot. I'm going to Israel. I'm not saying who I'm meeting with.
Would you meet with him?
I would, but I'm not saying -- I'm not -- I'm just going to Israel some time before the end of the year, I'm going to Israel, but I'm not saying who I'm meeting with.
What's your reason for going?
I have a very close tie to Israel. I've always had. I've received many awards right out in that street called Fifth Avenue. I was grand marshal of the Israeli Day parade, when it was a very, very dangerous thing to do. That was during the period of conflict. And the Jewish people have always been great to me.
Thank you, Mr. Trump.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it. I really do. Thank you.
Thank you.
Mr. Trump, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.
Thank you.
Top Republicans met in Washington this week and discussed the possibility of a brokered convention to block you from being the GOP nominee. Your reaction to the idea that members of the establishment, some members are talking about trying to stop you?
Well, I think they're making a big mistake, number one. I think I'm going to be the one that beats Hillary. You know, the FOX poll, your own poll came out and said I beat Hillary rather easily. I think they are rather kidding themselves. I'm leading in virtually every state. I'm leading in Iowa, a "Des Moines Register " does a poll, and I'm sure that will be negative when they announce their poll.
But when you say they're kidding themselves, meaning what?
They're kidding themselves, I'm going to win. I think I'm going to win. You know, I'm not one of these other guys that goes down. I don't go down. I go up. My whole life has been about winning. I'm going to win.
You say that you make break your pledge and run as an independent if the party doesn't treat you fairly. When you hear about leaders talking about a brokered convention, when you hear about the New York GOP, some people saying let's throw him out, do you have a warning for GOP leaders?
Look, I understand what they're going through. I wasn't supposed to be here. I was a member of the establishment seven months ago. I gave $350,000 to the Republican Governors Association. I'm not supposed to be doing this. You see I'm supposed to be on the other side writing checks and having people do whatever I want, puppets, like puppets.
Some of the things as you said haven't made people happy. You say the Muslim ban is about security, not about religion, but you would block all foreign Muslims. That's 1.5 -- let me just finish.
Go ahead.
I think here's the point, Mr. Trump -- I think people would understand it if you were basing it on countries, saying don't let people in from Syria or Libya, war areas, but --
Well, I've done that also.
But there are 200 million Muslims in Indonesia. There's --
I've done that also.
This week, you've been called a bigot, a fascist, a demagogue. I looked up the word demagogue in the dictionary and it says someone, a public official who seeks support based on appealing to people's fear and prejudice.
Not me.
You say this is temporary unless we figure out, in your words, quote, "what the hell is going on."
It's temporary. Chris, they've got to help us.
I understand. But you call on our leaders in Washington losers.
I didn't say losers. I said they're stupid, OK?
OK, but my point is --
Losers is not a strong enough term.
Why not?
Because I don't think he has the right temperament. I don't think he's got the right judgment.
Most of the so-called experts are now saying maybe Trump wins the nomination, but he's still going to get swamped in the general election by Hillary Clinton. And they point to this, among women, 27 percent have a favorable view of you, 62 percent unfavorable. Among blacks --
Here's your problem. Here's your problem --
Can I just read --
No, no, I think this. You're quoting one poll, because there are other polls where I'm very favorable with women.
What do you mean she's killed hundreds of thousands?
She was Secretary of State. Obama was president. The team -- two real geniuses --
Finally, let's talk money. Should congressional Republicans put policy riders in a bill to keep the government funded? And if so, what issues are worth risking a government shutdown.
If you had leadership you wouldn't have to talk about a government shutdown. And one of the things I'm so disappointed with the Republicans is that we have a budget and then they go to sleep for two years. They don't do anything. And they start talking about it just before the budget comes up. It doesn't work that way.
Finally --
It's called the art of the deal, in all fairness. I mean, nobody in our government understands the art of the deal.
Finally, the Federal Reserve meets this week. Should they raise interest rates and what do you think of Fed Chairman Janet Yellen?
Well, she's always been known as very low interest, and as a developer, I like low interest rates. As somebody that loves our country, you're going to have to start raising them. She should start raising them a little bit at least.
Mr. Trump --
Thank you.
-- thank you.
Thank you very much.
But this is your campaign headquarters?
It is. And we have other space, but this is it. Now, this is our central headquarters.
I've got to ask a question. Headquarters are usually bustling with hundreds of people. You've got a few of them.
Well, I have people -- no, this is our central headquarters. We have a number of people in offices. There's Corey, our man.
Right.
And I said no, and they're going to sign or they signed Arnold Schwarzenegger.
In 2004, yes.
Yes, in 2003 and 2004. But I was against...
Yes.
My tone is very strong. I said, isn't that a good thing?
Your Muslim friends are happy -- are happy?
Radicalized -- I have many friends, and at the highest level. And they -- I have partners that are Muslim. I have unbelievable relationships.
Well, I don't think anyone doubts that radical Islam is a big problem. But I think the question is, is your proposed solution a good thing or not? Let me just...
Well, you know -- in my solution, you know it's a temporary -- it's a temporary solution.
But that was about a group of...
Because they didn't want to be accused of racial profiling.
But they didn't see bombs, is the point. It was because they saw a lot of young Muslim men.
They saw something. They didn't want to call because they thought -- they didn't want to be accused of racial profiling. It sounds like a lawyer gave them that idea.
So, there...
Now, we can be politically correct, and I could say, oh, well, no, there's no problem, and we will go on forever. Why are people...
Look, I'm not -- I'm agreeing with you there's a problem. I'm agreeing.
Jake, why are people blowing airplanes out of the air?
... since the Taliban fell.
Good.
Who?
Who told you that? I mean, you just tell me about one is a pilot, one is -- who told they do more than you do...
But you would ban them from coming into this country.
Look, look, I don't know anything about the women you just mentioned.
OK.
OK?
Who are you getting support from?
Let me just tell you -- well, take a look. Read the newspapers. Read international newspapers.
I did. But I saw Netanyahu put out a statement distancing himself from you. David Cameron did.
Well, when you -- no, not distancing himself. I had a meeting with Netanyahu, who I could be at the meeting right now.
You know why he won't, though, right? It's the same reason Bush was reluctant to.
I don't believe that...
Because they...
I don't believe that -- he's not doing it. And Hillary Clinton won't do it either.
Right.
Although I am saying you have to surveil. There has to be surveillance.
You said you were all about security.
And we should -- listen, when my friends call me up, and they call me up very strongly and they say, it's something -- and these are Muslims. And they say, it's something, Donald, that has to be talked about.
Tough in a bad way or in a good way, or...
Well, I think they were very, very tough to a certain community. There's no question about it.
To the African-American community.
I thought it was very tough to the African-American community, actually.
Yes.
... because I actually saw it in print. And I'm going -- I read a lot of stuff. And I'm going, whoa.
So Mr. Trump, you came in as the front runner. You were treated that way. People had a lot of targeted questions for you, both from the panel and the other candidates. How did you think it went?
I thought it was great. I really enjoyed it. I thought CNN was a little unfair. But that's OK. I thought really we had a great debate. I think it was one of my better ones. We have done very well in the debates. I wouldn't be on the position I am in. And I really enjoyed this one in particular. I had a good time.
What made this one special for you?
Well, I think I'm getting a little more used to it. You know, I have never debated before. I have been producing jobs all my life. I have been building buildings and doing lots of other things and creating businesses. And now, I'm all of a sudden in the world of debating. And I really enjoyed doing it. I have really had a great time and look forward to the next one. But I thought this was an elegant group of people. I though the last one was very elegant also. It is an interesting word to use, but this is elegant and that was very elegant.
Who was second best?
Well, I don't want to say who did well, who didn't. I mean, you people make that judgment. But I just felt that we had a very good night. And everybody is telling me based on all of the polling that is going on right now that we had a very good night.
You were unusually quick to not have any static with Ted Cruz when you were given the opening by one of the questioners. Why?
Well, I just think he didn't say anything that I particularly disagreed with. And I thought he was nice as to his statement that took place behind closed doors. I though he was very respectful and nice. And I have respect for that. So, you know, I get along with Ted very well, actually.
He did not say what he had said to the group of fundraisers. Is that what you mean by nice about him?
I just think he was very nice and very respectful and I have a lot of respect for Ted.
The burden of being a front runner. As you say, you set the agenda on some big issues. Certainly, you brought immigration into the foreign way it hadn't been before. You could argue, you did that about how to deal with radical Islamism. You are going to be taken the heat when you set the agenda. Aren't you?
Well, I don't think there is ever a burden to be front runner. I would like to have that burden for the rest of my life. I like to be front runner. And frankly, to me it's a great honor. It is not a burden. It is great honor. Having that center podium is a great honor to me.
No matter what?
No, no matter what.
Not no matter what?
No matter what. Look. It's like a Boxer. The only way to win a home decision is you have to knock them out. If I get the votes, nobody can do anything. If I get the delegates, nobody is going to do anything. And I'm leading in a lot of states. You probably just see PPP just came out with I'm leading in Iowa now and I'm leading in a lot of states. And you know, it's on my shoulders. I hope I get the votes. I will be trying very hard and I will make our country great again.
What if you have some delegates not enough. It goes to convention and you feel they box you out?
I want to really just do it the old fashioned way. We are going to run as a Republican. I'm going to try and win as a Republican. I hope I am going to be treated fairly. FOX, as you know, just came out with the poll and I beat Hillary Clinton head. There are couple of other, once I have said that. And I haven't even really gone after her yet. You know, I have been focused here, 15 people here, and I have been focused here as you may have noticed. I haven't really focused on Hillary. When I do, I think she's going to fall because when she does as poor job as she -- if he is allowed to run. I mean, I don't even know that she is going to be allowed to run.
Mr. Trump, thank you very much for speaking to us. Congratulations on tonight.
Thank you.
Senator Cruz didn't follow through with any attacks on you tonight, and you seemed to back off some of your earlier criticism. Are you --
No, I get along great with him. I mean, he's been backing me all along, he's been really the one person that backed me with virtually everything, and we have a very good relationship. And I was very happy to see that he backed off his statement that he made, you know, in the closed doors. I respect him for it. I have a lot of respect for him, he's a good guy.
You did call him a maniac. You're not going to do that again?
Yes, but you know what? Time goes by.
More than that.
-- I mean I don't blame him. Bill, I don't blame him. He's got to do something because obviously, if he's got 2 in the poll or 3 in the poll, he's got to be doing something.
OK, but do you feel --
So I don't really blame him.
Yes, but they all feel that way.
So I attacked back. I don't -- no, they don't, actually. He was really the only one of any consequence that went after me and a couple of little shots. But his whole thing was about going after me. And they wrote it out, just like his pollster said. He repeated whatever his pollster told him to do. And I thought it was inappropriate.
I was surprised they didn't come after you with the Muslim stuff more. They made -- some of the candidates made passing --
It was barely mentioned.
-- passing references.
-- Bill, it was barely mentioned.
Right.
Yes. It was barely mentioned.
All right --
So let's see what happens. But nevertheless, Bill, it's a subject that should be discussed and it has been discussed. And now people are saying, you know what -- and I'm talking about Muslims are calling me that are friends of mine. I have a lot of friends that are Muslims. And they're saying, really, this is a subject that should be discussed.
All right.
I have no respect for him.
You should watch. He's a very --
I think he's a very biased -- Bill -- Bill.
You should watch the debate I had with him about you last night.
I did.
OK.
And I appreciate my defense. I have no --
No, no, no. I was defending your campaign.
-- respect for Charles Krauthammer.
-- not your policy.
He is a totally biased terrible guy.
He doesn't want -- he doesn't think you have the policy chops. And other people feel the same way. You don't have the policy chops. So when you say --
I think I do. I think I know more about policy than just about anybody, Bill --
Of course. And -- and millions of people --
-- if you want to know the truth.
I would.
You wouldn't even be talking about it.
All right. So you're telling me you don't do this to whip up the base --
And -- and by the way, Bill --
-- and whip up your crowd?
I don't. I don't. And -- but I do what's right. I do what's right. We're going to make America great again. I say what's right. I say what's on my mind. And that's what's happening. And that's why I have 42 and guys like Bush have 2 or nothing.
But that's based on emotion. Surely you know that it's based on emotion.
Because I say what -- I say what's right.
But you're not going to assassinate them. You might arrest them, but you're not going to assassinate them, are you?
I don't know what I'd do. I don't know what I'd do. But I'll tell you what --
You don't know what you'd do? Come on.
-- they care more about their families -- Bill, they care more about their families than they care about themselves.
You would arrest her?
-- or he does the -- I would do pretty severe stuff as far as I'm concerned.
Do you think CNN dislikes you, the news organization itself?
Well, honestly, I think I get better press from CNN than I do Fox, Bill, if you want to know the truth.
Well, that's because we're the toughest network. I mean --
No. I don't know why. I don't know why.
Well, because that's --
I don't know why.
-- our job is to be tough.
But I think I get covered better --
You want power.
-- I think I get covered better --
But you want power and it's our job to vet you in the best way we can. But look, you're --
I don't mind.
-- you are -- you are too thin-skinned.
I don't mind bad things about me if it's true. I can handle that but when people say untrue things, I don't like it.
But you want to be president. Tweet about Putin. Tweet about ISIS. I mean --
Well, I do that, too.
-- it looks petty.
I do that, too.
It looks petty.
I do that, too, Bill.
Don't you think it looks petty?
No, I mean I do that, too. I do a lot of different things. But when people --
You don't think you are too thin-skinned. You might have to overlook some of this stuff if you become president, you know.
I don't think I'm thin-skinned. No. I like to have the truth told about me.
All right. All right.
The poll just came out and we're doing great in Iowa, too. I think -- I hope I'm going to win Iowa.
OK -- we're glad you like them. I'm sure they're really happy you like them, too.
But I don't want to say who it is. You know what, if I thought that I really had major competition, I wouldn't be telling you about it, Bill. I'm not like President Obama, where he tells everybody everything, including the enemy and then the enemy knows exactly how to beat us. That's what happens.
All right.
I'm not going to tell you.
Look, I probably won't talk to you again before Christmas. I want you and your family to have a good one. You know, no coal in the stocking this year, Donald. Come on now.
No.
-- present.
Bill, you hear the expression, Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
And Happy Holidays. But Merry Christmas -- we'll bring back the words "Merry Christmas" again, Bill. Thank you.
No matter what?
No. No matter what. Look...
Good evening. I'm back in Las Vegas here. And I got sitting with being me front-runner for the Republican presidential nominee. He is about 40 percent right now, if you average it out. Maybe 42 by his count. Jeb Bush who was supposed to be number one is at three. What happened?
I don't know. He is a nice man. I mean, I got to like him a lot. Although, he was a little aggressive tonight. He tried to -- you know, I think I would probably be doing the same thing if I were him. But you know what? He's a good man. And I understand what he is doing.
You are acting like a winner tonight. You said tonight that you would run as a Republican. No third party option. What changed your mind? Because you have talked about that. You said if they don't treat you fairly in the Republican Party, you were going to pull.
I mean, basically if you look what's happened, I'm number one by a lot, I think by 27 points. And since what am I going to do? Leave and run as an independent? You know, it doesn't. And over the last four or five month, I have got into a lot of great Republicans. And I think they are all going to come together. They are going to coalesce and we are going to do very well. I have had some terrific poll against Hillary. You know, FOX came out last week where we beat her by five points. And I think we're going to --
But those polls are crazy. One of the poll shows like Carson beating her. Do you believe that?
Well, you never know. I mean, you will never know. He's a quality guy. I mean, we were talking to him before. He is a very high quality guy.
Let me try a reciprocal question. As a good Republican now, would you endorse and support whoever wins on your party's side?
Yes, I would.
With enthusiasm?
With enthusiasm. I mean, I've gotten to know most of them pretty well. I like a lot of them. I can't say I love everybody, but I like a lot of them. And I respect quite a few of them.
Four guys tonight, Carson, you, Cruz and Paul. You had a pretty good fight going with the neo-con crowd led by Cruz.
What did we get out of it?
I'm sorry, Cruz is on your side. Rubio is the other side. It was a good fight.
We spent $4 trillion. We have a country that's falling apart, our infrastructure, our roads, our highways, our schools, our hospitals, our airports are falling apart. I go all over the world. I go to some of these countries where they have airports the likes of which we never see.
I've got another question for you.
Go ahead.
What has Cruz ever built?
Well, I don't want to get into because he has been so nice to me.
He's not going to stay nice to you.
No. At some point, he has to.
He was hedging towards you tonight. He was moving towards you.
He was. He was very nice. I mean, I think he was very nice, very respectful. I respect him. But you gave me a great ad. I'm doing the ad. I'm doing the ad.
Is that a good thing?
No, it is great. I said, you know, what, I came out -- at first, I listened I said wait a minute, that's a great idea. I'm doing an ad like that.
OK. I ask you last question before you leave. You can leave, but I would like you to stay. Is Donald Trump honest when he says that Barack Obama isn't a legitimate president?
So I knew you were going to ask me that question.
It's a good question.
I didn't say you couldn't. I knew --
You can't stop me.
Because you know, I should really -- no, I can't. I should not tell you this, but I do watch you a lot. So I knew you were going to ask that question.
Because he is president of the United States.
I don't answer that anymore.
You answer the questions you like.
by the way, this guy is a total professional. I have to tell you. Here is I said. I don't answer, because if I do answer, that's all people want to talk about.
If you take the oval office, the president leaving the office is illegitimate?
But I don't answer that question, because once I answer the question, they don't want to talk about the economy.
No, it's over. You know, we, Catholics believe in confession. You say you were wrong and you move on. You really believe this guy isn't a legitimate president?
I don't want to answer the question. I don't want to answer the question. Did you have a good time? Was it a good interview?
What this? Well, I watched you for a longer time, but thank you, Mr. Trump.
We will do it again. I would love to.
Mr. Trump, I do think that is a blemish. I think it is your original --.
No, I know how you feel.
I think because I am American. I think our president should be respectful. And I think he is a little ethnic aspect to and I don't like it. He's African-American and we're saying he's not a real president? I don't like that. It is not a good thing about you. I'm allowed to say you're a mixed bag. Thank you. We'll have you for an hour.
Thank you. Take care of yourself.
We will have for an hour.
We'll do it.
We'll go to Wharton.
We will do it the same.
We will pay for the whole thing.
The cathedral, right?
That's right. Thank you, Mr. Trump.
You take care of yourself.
What would you do differently? How would you stop this process that has so many people frustrated?
Well, it's not only that process. It's every year. We're at $19 trillion. We're going to be up to $21 trillion in terms of debt. It's not -- I mean, the whole thing is just a total mess. And then you read the line items and the different items that you just read to me -- and these are things -- I mean, sanctuary cities? People are going crazy over the sanctuary city concept. It's just horrible.
Well...
Look at all the deaths that are being caused. It's horrible!
Listen, I'll add...
It's so sad. I mean, honestly, look...
You know, I have the list...
It's pretty sad.
Well, let me ask you that...
... because there's division in the party.
Let's say you get the nomination. There are a lot of smart people on that stage. A lot of people have some pretty strong records, maybe even people that are out of the race, like Bobby Jindal or Scott Walker.
Right.
Let me ask you this last question. What -- look, this process -- and I've interviewed all the candidates on a regular basis. What drives you to do this? Who are you thinking about? Who do you want to help the most in this process? In other words, who are the...
Well, you know...
Yes.
... because I don't feel safe and you don't feel safe and nobody feels safe. So we're going to make America great again. We're going to make America safe again. We're going to really do a great job. If I get elected, you're going to see things happen that you wouldn't have believed possible. We're going to win again, Sean.
This country is in decline, and it's sad to see. The American dream that I've had, that you've had, I want that for everybody, and it sounds like you do, too. Mr. Trump...
We can turn it around, Sean. Sean, we can turn it around. I'll tell you what. If we're going to go another four years like this, or eight years, with a Hillary...
God forbid.
... who's horrible, who's terrible? But I'm telling you, Sean, we can turn it around pretty quickly.
All right, Mr. Trump. Merry Christmas if I don't see you before then, and we'll see you in the new year. Thank you, sir.
Merry Christmas. Thank you.
Joining us now, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Donald, good morning.
Good morning.
How's it going?
It's going well.
Yeah? Do you like Vladimir Putin's comments about you?
Sure. When people call you brilliant it's always good, especially when the person heads up Russia.
Well, I mean, also it's a person that kills journalists, political opponents, and invades countries. Obviously, that would be a concern, would it not?
He's return running his country and at least he's a leader. You know, unlike we have in this country.
But again, he kills journalists that don't agree with him.
I think our country does plenty of killing also, Joe. You know. There's a lot of stupidity going on in the world right now, Joe. A lot of killing going on and a lot of stupidity and that's the way it is. But you didn't ask me the question. You asked me a different question. So that's fine.
I'm confused. So you obviously condemn Vladimir Putin killing journalists and political opponents, right?
Oh sure, absolutely.
All right. So how would America's relationship with Russia change if you were president?
Well, I think it would be good. I've always felt fine about Putin. I think that he is a strong leader. He's a powerful leader. He's represented his country, that's the way the country is being represented. He's actually got popularity within his country. They respect him as a leader. Certainly over the last couple of years they've respected him as their leader. I think he's up in the 80s which is, you know, you see where Obama's in the 30s and low 40s, and he's up in the 80s. So I guess, and I don't know who does the polls, maybe he does the polls, but I think they're done by American companies, actually, so.
So what would you do as president, as commander in chief, to drive Vladimir Putin's forces out of the Crimea and out of Ukraine and make sure that he doesn't move further west and move those troops towards Kiev?
Sure. But you know, I've -- you know, pretty strong views on the Ukraine. I have many, many friends from the Ukraine and they're fantastic people. But when I look at the Ukraine and I see Germany doing nothing and I see so many other countries over there not really engaged and we're totally engaged and I ask myself, you know, here's this big monstrous country, Germany, and they hardly speak up, they accept his oil and gas and lots of other things and here we are fighting like hell and we owe 19 trillion in debt and we have nothing but problems in this country and we're sitting on a big fat beautiful bubble that's ready to explode, financial bubble I'm talking about. And we're always at the forefront of leading the charge. I think that other countries have to get involved with that, Joe. You have the Ukraine and it affects other countries a hell of a lot more than it affects us.
Right. But if there's strong American leadership, other countries will follow. It seems to me that --
No, I think that's fine but --
I think a lot of Americans would agree with you, but wouldn't some Obama critics say that sounds a lot like leading from behind?
Oh, I don't think it's leading from behind. I think I want to see our country get rebuilt again. Our country is falling apart, frankly. Our infrastructure is a disaster. Our bridges are falling down. 61 percent of our bridges are in danger. Our whole country is a mess and, you know, you're asking me a question. There's lots of things we can do. But one of things I want to do is make America great again.
So you're talking about limiting America's reach -- I got to say, in much the same way that George W. Bush in 2000 before 9/11 talked about how we needed to have a more humbled foreign policy. If that's the case, do you also think that we've spent too much on defense spending and that sequestration is actually a good idea and we should use that money that we're not spending on the Pentagon to rebuild our infrastructure?
I think we have to really rebuild our military. That doesn't mean we have to use it. I think we've used our military far too much on certain things and certainly we haven't used it very well. But I think we have to rebuild our military, frankly. I think our military is in shambles. I looked at General Odierno saying we're the least prepared that we've ever been as a country and probably today we have to be the most prepare. You know, the world hates us. They truly hate us. So I'm very, very pro and very strong on the military. But I'm also strong on rebuilding our infrastructure in our country and rebuilding our schools and taking care of our education systems and --
So how do we pay for that?
We've spent $5 trillion in the Middle East. If you add it all up. Five trillion dollars. Probably close to 3 trillion in Iraq. We have nothing -- who is going to get Iraq and they should be thanking us every day because nobody has done to a country what Iran has done to us. Between this nuclear and now -- which is one of the worst negotiations I've ever seen of any kind -- But bigger than that, the only deal that they're going to make that's even better is we have hand and gift wrapped Iraq and we're hanging it to Iran. I've been saying this for years. Iran is taking over Iraq. I mean, how simple can anything be? Iran -- we have totally decapitated Iraq. They used to be of equal status militarily and now we have gift wrapped it and we have given Iraq to Iraq with, by the way, the second largest oil reserves in the world. So Iran made one deal better than the nuclear deal by a factor of hundreds we have given them Iraq.
So Donald, I want to ask you about a topic that's really been in the headlines now for weeks and that's your temporary ban on Muslims coming into this country. Polls are showing that you're really striking a cord whether or not you agree with it or not. I'm asking you if you could right now speak to the Muslim-American population and tell them what you would do or say as president to make sure they feel that they are as much a part of this country as everyone else is.
Sure. I have many friends who are Muslim. They are great people. They're tremendous people. But there's something going on, I mean, whether you like it or not and I've seen various polls where 25 percent of the people would support and really, I mean, you look at some of the numbers, 25 percent of the people would support very, very substantial violence from within. That's not acceptable. Then somebody said, oh, it's not really 25 percent, it's only 10 percent or it's only 7 percent. Well one percent is not -- because the kind of violence we're talking about is extraordinary violence.
-- about what would make them feel welcome in this country?
-- And that includes within the mosques because --
Hey, Donald. It's John Heilemann here.
Hi, John, how are you?
Nobody attacked. Jeb was the only one that attacked you. Why do you think Marco and everybody else stayed away from you?
I don't know. I mean, I don't know. I think they did a very smart thing, but I don't know. And you know, it's just -- I assumed that I was going to be attacked by almost everybody.
Donald, if you were in second or third or fourth place and 20 points behind, it's confounding to me, as a political analyst, that would be like kneeling if you're down 30 points at half time and just trying to run up the clock. Why aren't they attacking you when they're down 20 points?
Well I think because most of them have numerous other people to go through before they get to me, to be honest. I mean, you know, you look at him. Like I think Jeb -- Jeb copied his pollster and he memorized a couple of lines given to him by his pollster. His pollster handed him a couple of lines. But I think Jeb makes a mistake because, you know, first of all, his poll numbers haven't gone up at all since the debate. Now maybe I haven't seen all the polls. But I think Jeb makes a mistake because he's got a lot of people to go through before he gets to me. So I think that's true with most of them. So I think I probably would agree that you have to go after the couple of people that are right in front of you, frankly.
Mr. Trump, Harold Ford. Good morning.
Hi, Harold.
Four years ago Mitt Romney said that Russia was our biggest strategic enemy. Several years before President Obama said he would reach out to adversaries by phone. He received criticism from Democrats and Republicans for saying that. Now you have Putin saying that -- he would have this great relationship. Could you understand why some would wonder, for years Russia has been our biggest adversary, perhaps greatest frustration with U.N. Security Council dealing with Iran and Syria, obviously the actions of Crimea. I just want to hear better clarification of the point. It would seem to be troubling to have Putin praise you as he has, and I understand your comments --
It's not troubling at all.
And say something nice about a Muslim-American today.
I will. I will. Believe that. Thank you very much.
You...
-- took place. I didn't say that about Mexicans.
You certainly...
I have great relationships with the Hispanics. And I didn't say what he said. You know, they -- they make up things in the world of politics. They're all talk and no action. They're politicians.
Well, you -- you've never come up with a video of those thousands of people cheering in New Jersey on 9/11.
Oh, there were plenty of people cheering, believe me. And I've come up with plenty. And The Washington Post  wrote a story that they tried to retract and there were many other stories written. And a lot of people -- thousands of people have been calling and writing and emailing, many people saw it. And it was in New Jersey and it was also all over the world, George. So there's an obvious problem, because all over the world -- and you're not even disputing that -- but people were celebrating all over the world. And I think it's disgusting.
-- right now.
There were articles...
No, but there was -- let's -- let's...
-- celebrating, George.
Well, they should turn them. I agree with you on that. One final question about Vladimir --
Well they should turn them in, but they're not going to turn them in with attitudes like your attitude, people won't turn them in. People are just going to go along the way. We have to solve a very serious problem and if you don't want to talk about it or if you think it's politically incorrect, that's your problem, not mine.
One final question about Vladimir Putin. When you were pressed about his killing of journalists, you said, "I think our country does plenty of killing too." What were you thinking about there? What killing sanctioned by the U.S. government is like killing journalists?
Well, I think, number one, I think Hillary, when she was Secretary of State, made some horrible, horrible decision and thousands and thousands and even hundreds of thousands of people have been killed. I mean you look at what went on in Libya, you look at so many bad decisions that she made. She's incompetent as far as I'm concerned. You look at her reign, she's incompetent.
That's not killing by the United States government, though, is it? That's not the same as ordering a killing.
As far as the reporters are concerned -- as far as the reporters are concerned, obviously I don't want that to happen. I think it's terrible -- horrible. But, in all fairness to Putin, you're saying he killed people. I haven't' seen that. I don't know that he has. Have you been able to prove that? Do you know the names of the reporters that he's killed? Because I've been -- you know, you've been hearing this, but I haven't seen the name. Now, I think it would be despicable if that took place, but I haven't' seen any evidence that he killed anybody in terms of reporters.
Here's what -- here's what Mitt Romney tweeted about that. He said, there's an important distinction here. Thug Putin kills journalists and opponents. Our presidents kill terrorists and enemy combatants.
Does he know for a fact that he kills the reporters? I don't know -- I don't think anybody knows that. It's possible that he does. But I don't think it's been proven. Has anybody proven that he's killed reporters? And I'm not trying to stick up for anybody --
But what killing has the United States government done?
George, excuse me. Let me finish. If he has killed reporters, I think that's terrible. But this isn't like somebody that's stood with a gun and he's, you know, taken the blame or he's admitted that he's killed. He's always denied it. He's never -- it's never been proven that he's killed anybody. So, you know, you're supposed to be innocent until proven guilty, at least in our country. He has not been proven that he's killed reporters.
I'm still waiting for the evidence that we've been directly involved in killing people as well. You made your points about Iraq. But I do want to move on --
Well, take a look at -- take a look at -- excuse me, take a look at the rampage all over the place. And you know what we've gotten for Iraq? We've spent $2 trillion, OK? We've -- thousands, hundreds of thousands of people killed. We've lost thousands and thousands of our great young people, soldiers. So, $2 trillion, deaths, wounded warriors, we have nothing and Iran is now taking over Iraq with the second largest oil reserves in the world. And I said, don't go in. But I said, when you go out, take the oil. And I've been saying that for four years to you and others and we were so incompetent, we didn't even get the oil. You know who got a lot of the oil? ISIS got a lot of the oil. That's who got the oil. And now Iran is taking the rest of it. They're going to get the lions share because we don't know what we're doing. We're run by people that don't have a clue.
We've empowered Iran more than Russia has?
George, we just made one of the worst deals I have ever seen in dealmaking. I'm not talking between nations. We don't even get our prisoners back. And now after the deal is made, they want to start talking as a new deal to get our prisoners back. And they want a lot for the prisoners, for the four prisoners. And by the way they say we're not going to give you four, we're only going to give you three.
Well, I'm joined now on the phone by Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS, sir.
Good morning, Chuck.
Now, I know what you're about to say, no fact checker has been able to back up her claim on that.
That's exactly correct. I was going to say that. Exactly correct.
Wait, let me stop...
She doesn't have...
-- you there.
-- she couldn't even get back -- George, she couldn't even get back on the stage. Nobody knows what happened to her. It's like she went home and went to sleep.
Why do you keep going on this?
She couldn't even get back on the stage last night.
Why?
I'll tell you why.
Why?
Because we need a president with great strength and great stamina. And Hillary doesn't have that. We cannot have another bad president like we have right now. We need a president with tremendous intelligence, smarts, cunning, strength and stamina.
There's a lot of things I've heard about...
And Hillary doesn't have that.
-- Hillary Clinton, the idea, though, she did travel more than any secretary of State. It's a grueling job. This is somebody that has been on a -- on the national stage for 25 years.
But she's sitting in an airplane, Chuck.
Where?
Of course.
Why are you so comfortable praising Vladimir Putin?
I'm not. I didn't praise him. He praised me. He called me brilliant. He said very nice things about me. I mean I -- I accepted...
You -- well, you called him a strong leader.
I mean I think he's -- I'm sure he's 100...
Right. But right now, Vladimir Putin is the best ally Iran has around the world and the best ally that Assad has...
No, no...
Yes?
-- we also handed them Iraq on a silver platter. We gave them Iraq with the second largest oil reserves in the world. They're taking over Iraq as you speak to me this morning.
Yes.
So we gave them one of the best deals ever made and by the way, they're taking that money now...
Right.
-- and they're giving it to Russia...
Do you...
-- and others, where they're buying armaments with...
Do you -- do you stand...
-- which nobody ever reports.
-- do you stick by the idea that the Middle East would be more stable today with Saddam Hussein and Gadhafi in power?
One hundred percent. A hundred percent. There's not even -- is -- is there even a doubt in your mind? And you wouldn't have the migration. And you wouldn't have people coming over to this country that we have no idea who they are. And if I win, they're going to have to go back because we have no idea who they are.
And if you become president --
One hundred percent.
Do you let Assad --
And you know what we would have done with --
Do you let Assad stay?
You know what we --
Do you let Assad stay?
You know what, well, you can't fight Assad and ISIS at the same time. You have to fight ISIS first. And I don't say Assad is good, but I think what this --
That's exactly what Bernie Sanders believes, by the way. You and Bernie Sanders are in line on this.
Well, that's OK. Then I agree with him on that. I'm -- I'm -- it's OK to agree with -- he's a guy -- I don't agree with him on much, but if he says that, I'm OK with it. Let me just tell you, you can't fight them both at the same time. And I say Assad's a bad guy. But we don't know who the rebels are that are fighting. Every time we get involved with rebels, take a look at Libya, take a look --
Right.
All these rebels, look what they did to our ambassador and those young -- young men, those wonderful young men. Every time we get involved -- in Benghazi, I'm talking about. Every time we get involved with rebels --
Right.
The rebels, they call them the freedom rebels, always nice names, it ends up being far worse than the people that were there in the first place. So Assad is not a good guy.
Yes.
But the people that we're backing, a lot of people think they're ISIS. That we're actually backing ISIS. So what are we doing? We have to get rid of ISIS first. Assad we can think about later on.
Yes. I mean --
He's got 2 percent in the polls. I have 41 percent in the latest poll. He has 2 percent. He's going to be off the stage soon.
OK.
He's an embarrassment to the Bush family. And, in fact, he doesn't even want to use the Bush name, which is interesting. Jeb is an embarrassment to himself and to his family.
Why --
And the Republican Party --
Yes.
Has -- has essentially -- they're not even listening to Jeb.
Why --
Jeb is saying that. By the way, Jeb --
Yes.
Jeb is only saying that to try and get a little mojo going.
OK.
But in the meantime, I went up 11 points in the new Fox poll.
Right.
I went up 11 points --
Yes.
After the debate and he went down two.
Yes.
And in South Carolina, I'm through the roof there. I mean I'm way ahead in those two states. And Ted and I are pretty even, although the last three polls --
Yes.
Have me up in Iowa, as you know.
Is it pretty fair to say that if you're not the nominee, you'd prefer Ted Cruz?
No, I don't want to say anything about that. But Ted has been very nice to me, very respectful. Very -- almost in every single instance he backs my ideas and, you know, probably more so. And Ben Carson has been very nice also. I mean I've had people -- look, I get along with a lot of the --
Right.
Believe it or not, I get along with a lot of the people on that stage, but Ted has been very nice to me, yes.
I look forward to a face to face before -- right after the first of the year.
You, too. Merry Christmas, happy New Year to everybody --
You got it. Stay safe.
And it's been an -- It's been an interesting time. Thank you very much.
Jeb Bush went after you in that Las Vegas debate, and he now has an ad. He seems to think he can revive his campaign by attacking you, your response.
I thought he was very weak in the debate. He had a couple sound bites giving to him by his people, I guess his pollsters. He hit me a couple times and I hit back harder. Look, he's a low-energy person, he's a weak person, and honestly that's not what we need. We need somebody who's strong who can get things done. He's a weak person. You can't have that.
You choose your insults very carefully. Again and again, you say Hillary Clinton doesn't have the strength and stamina to be President. You're 69, she's 68...
I am not talking about age.
Are you suggesting she's frail?
I am suggesting that she does not have the strength or the stamina.
What does that mean?
She sees you guys for about ten minutes, she sees you for a little while, it's all rehearsed and staged. They'll pick a couple people out of the audience. She'll still a little unstable and she goes around for five or six days and you don't see her.
Are you suggesting health issues.
No, no, I am saying she's not strong enough to be President. We need a President that can go 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. She can't do it. Look, Hillary Clinton goes away three, four, five days. You have a very good guy, Mr. Henry, right? Good man.
Vladimir Putin bear hugged you, practically endorsed you, said you're an outstanding -- talented and welcoming your call for tighter and deeper relations with Russia. Could Putin's praise signal to voters that you are not taking a tough enough towards Russia?
It could and you know, the smart people would say that's a great thing. What do we need problems for? Obama and Putin don't get along. What do we need problems for, Howie? He even called me brilliant. Isn't that nice?
You said that was an honor.
I think it's an honor. Hey, I complement people sometimes, maybe sometimes you don't mean it, but I think he meant it. I tell you what. What's the purpose? I do feel that Russia, instead of being this group that we don't talk to, we're always -- I think they can be used for the good. We want to knock out ISIS. They want to knock out ISIS as much as us. They're knocking out airplanes that are Russian-owned airplanes.
Let's talk about some of the journalists not in the opinion business, Tom Brokaw, a dangerous proposal that overrides history, the law, and the foundation of America itself.
Do you want me to comment on Tom Brokaw? I am not a fan of Tom Brokaw. Never was a fan. When I did the Apprentice he came over with me, and said thank you, Mr. Trump because I had the big show on NBC and it was good for him with his newscast, and now all of a sudden the first chance he gets, he attacks me. But he came over -- thanks me so much, thank you for doing such a great job because it was so successful. Tom Brokaw -- and I understand somebody has to bring up when there's a problem. There's a problem. There's something wrong. Something is going on. There is a level of hatred there, whether it's a 25 percent group or 10 percent group, there's a level of hatred. We have to figure out what's going on.
Let me read you some others -- Campbell Brown, telling her colleagues in the TV business, for one week don't say his name. Let's stop being complicit in promoting his hateful and harmful demagoguery.
You know what's interesting about Campbell Brown? For years I haven't heard of her name. I didn't even know she was still alive, but I guess she is.
Ben Smith -- Buzzfeed he told reporters it's ok to call Trump a mendacious racist. The Daily Beast Executive Editor Noah Shankman says people should boycott your businesses because he thinks you're a racist and neofascist. What do you make of this combined...
I am the only one who speaks my mind and tells the truth. I have great friends who are Muslims -- some of them are not so thrilled, but at the highest level, they called me and said what you did is right, there's a problem, and we have to get to the bottom of it. There's a level of hatred and viciousness that we have to find out what we're going to do about it.
You had to know when you said that there would be a media explosion, that you would be attacked, many in the Republican Party tagged you -- Democrats obviously, many in the media, but then it puts you at the center...
And many agree. By the way, you don't say that. Many agreed with me.
You told Chris Wallace that Ted Cruz is a bit of a maniac in the Senate, not qualified to be President, and in the debate you said his temperament is fine, you two get along, but why did you call him a maniac?
I do like him. He said something about me and I said something with a little smile, and frankly I -- we had a lot of fun at the debate. I got to know him well over the last three days, I said he's fine. He's actually a very nice guy. I tell you about Cruz -- he's the one person -- and Ben Carson also, but then he hit me and I hit him, he retreated a bit -- -- not retreated. I really like him, and I really like Ted Cruz. A lot of people don't Ted Cruz. I like him. He's the one person that when I said things were right but controversial. A lot of things I say are correct, but controversial, because our world is so politically correct. You say correct things, all of a sudden they say basically they're basic statements, but Ted Cruz would back me 100 percent, I guess virtually every time. You cover it better than anybody.
You said the CNN moderators were stirring up, Trump said this, said that, you want to respond. You're the front-runner by a lot, you would say.
By a lot.
Of course, a lot of the questions are going to revolve around you.
I didn't think it was that -- the first debate, if you look at the first big portion of the show was Donald Trump said this, Donald Trump said that, and I said what's going on? Even my wife commented, this is sort of terrible, like stirring up trouble, and here's poor Jeb, getting killed in the polls, very ineffective candidate and they asked him a question -- Donald Trump said, the poor guy is standing there, and he gave a sound bite.
You said that you would talk to people like Bill Gates about closing up that internet...
No, no, not closing the internet.
Those are your words.
For ISIS, take those sections where ISIS is, knock out the internet.
You say only foolish people would raise concerns about freedom of speech.
Only stupid people. I would go a step further. Can you imagine freedom of speech for ISIS? I am not talking about closing it up on Miami Beach.
How do you accomplish that?
You do it technologically. These are very smart people. These are the inventors of the internet. We have the investors of the internet. The smartest people on Earth, they invented it. ISIS uses the internet better than us. ISIS recruits -- ISIS is recruiting our children using the internet. This was one point I am saying about the internet. I couldn't believe it. I could see there was a little rustling in the audience. You said you have to be kidding, freedom of speech for ISIS? What I am saying is they are recruiting our children and the children of other countries to go fight for them. And I am saying either close it up or would what I like actually better is to infiltrate the ISIS internet.
I would love to see terrorists deprived of those online tools, but it may be complicated.
I was referring to ISIS.
You've gone from calling journalists scum to sleazebags.
Those aren't strong enough.
You also this week -- that's not strong enough, you want to give us another adjective? You said that CNN treats you better than Fox. In terms of the commentators, Charles Krauthammer, George Will, and Rich Lowery -- they have ripped you...
Though Rich Lowery is coming along nicely, because he's getting it. He gets it.
You hit him back in speeches, in interviews and on twitter. Would you say Fox is unfair in its news coverage?
It doesn't matter. They do a story -- Krauthammer is crazed, George Will is crazed. He starts to shake.
They don't think you're a real conservative.
You know what I am? I am a winner. I've been winning all my life. They're not winners. Number one, they said I am not going to run.
I just tried to be fair.
You weren't fair there. You weren't good there. More importantly, about you guys, I am not treated well when they do a story and then I get Krauthammer commenting or George Will, Steven Hays, they mentioned Trump, and he goes -- it's like he becomes like a shaking monster. I've never seen anything like it. The level of hatred is incredible. I am pretty much on their side on most of the issues.
Bill O'Reilly said you were petty and thin-skinned. I say you have every right to hit back when you're criticized, but you almost seem obsessive about it. My question is that you can't restrain yourself? Or is it a strategy because a lot of your supporters despise the media?
It's neither. I don't mind a bad story when I do something wrong. When I do something wrong, a bad story doesn't even bother me.
Dishonest because they disagree.
And it's good when I fire at them. First, it makes me feel good. Second of all, it takes away credibility. You have to fight for yourself. That's a problem with our country, we don't fight for ourselves. We're not respected anymore as a country. Look, again, if they critique me and I thought they were right, I wouldn't be upset by it, but when you do something great and they try and belittle you, you've got to fight.
Donald Trump thanks very much.
Thank you very much.
Donald Trump joins us by phone now. Mister Trump, good morning. Good talking to you.
Good morning.
Let's talk about this fire -- this criticism. You fired right back at Hillary Clinton after the debate on Saturday night. She said that your words on this ban of Muslims entering the country have become ISIS's best recruiting tool, that they are actually showing people videos of your comment. You said there's no proof, there's no tape, thus she is a liar and lies a lot. But don't you open yourself up to the very same criticism when it comes to your claims that thousands of Muslims celebrated on 9/11? There is no tape, there is no proof. So are you guilty by your same standard?
Well, first of all, there is proof because many people saw that happen, Matt, as you know. It was written about in the Washington Post and numerous other places. I've been totally exonerated from that. I've had headlines exonerating me and saying Trump was right. I can send you a Breitbart story, I can send you other stories. But as far as Hillary is concerned, she's always been whether it's Whitewater or the email scandal, she always lies. And now to be saying that we're just right in the perfect spot with respect to ISIS, I don't -- I don't think that's a lie. I really don't think she knows what she's doing. She's been a mess no matter where she's been. She's created a mess. You look at her record as Secretary of State --
We can go back and forth on -- on the --
Excuse me, Matt.
No. I'm saying we can go back and forth on whether there is video to prove that Muslims celebrated on 9/11. But let me ask you this.
Well, you can go back and forth. There's -- there's many, many, many witnesses. There have been many stories that have come out that they celebrated. And by the way, Matt --
Around the world, there were comments and so --
-- just to put it another way, they celebrated all over the world when the World Trade Center was falling down which is disgusting.
The question is --
But they also happened to celebrate in parts of New York and certainly in parts of New Jersey.
Let me move on. When you and I were at that town --
We have plenty of -- We have plenty of information on that, Matt, that's coming out.
When you and I were at that town hall meeting in New Hampshire a couple months ago, I asked you about some of your controversial comments, Donald, and I went back to your own book The Art Of The Deal where you wrote about some of the things that you've said in the past, "I play to people's fantasies. I call it truthful hyperbole. It's an innocent form of exaggeration and a very effective form of promotion." So is Hillary Clinton lying or is she taking a page out of Donald Trump's playbook?
Matt, you're talking about people dying. You're talking about making up tapes and videos which don't exist. Her spokesperson last night made the statement, and I think she said she was sorry. She said the videos do not exist. Her spokesperson said this. So what am I going to tell you? Now, I would say this, Matt. I will demand an apology from Hillary, OK. You can be the messenger. I will demand an apology from Hillary. She should apologize. She lies about emails. She lies about Whitewater. She lies about everything. She will be a disaster as President of the United States.
I will deliver that message. I promise you.
OK.
Let me ask you one other quick question. Is there some kind of a deal, Donald, between you and Ted Cruz? If I notice, as the Iowa caucuses approach, you've been tough on just about every one of the Republican candidates, saved Ted Cruz, and he has really held his fire when it comes to you. Have you guys made some deal behind the scenes that you will not criticize each other?
No. No, we haven't, Matt. We just get along. And, I mean, frankly from the time I came out, I was right about so many things. I was right about illegal immigration, and he backed me on it before it was fashionable to back me. I was right about so many different elements and so many things. I was right about building the wall, and we will build a wall, and it will stop people from coming in illegally. We want people to come in --
Right.
-- but we want them to come in legally. He backed me on that, so he backed me on just about everything I said, and we get along well. I mean, that's -- look, ultimately it's probably going to come down to me against him. I have a very, very big lead right now.
Right.
You know I like to win and you know I win. Let's see what happens.
All right.
Ultimately, I'm sure the peace will end because at some point we're going to have to go after each other.
This is one of those strange year -- strange years, Donald, where politics and pop culture mix. So I'm going to ask you to stick around and react to the story that Willie is about to bring us, OK?
OK, I will.
2016 presidential candidate Donald Trump is on the phone to go ON THE RECORD. Good evening, sir.
Good evening.
Well, I think so. But here is your problem is that it looks like -- look, from the numbers, it looks like you are going to get the Republican nomination. A lot can happen between now and the convention next summer.
Which is true.
Let me talk about money with you. Let me talk money with you.
Go ahead.
A $1.1 trillion spending bill was passed last week by a government, by a GOP controlled House and Senate signed by the Democratic president, $1.1 trillion.
Terrible.
Is it different though? Is it different though? It's one thing if, you know, the children aren't part of the campaign. But can he use it sort of almost like a human shield? He has used his children.
Maybe you can -- maybe you can in terms of a newspaper, but you can't depict them as they were depicted. I think that's inappropriate.
Donald, thank you for joining us. Merry Christmas, happy New Year, and I hope you come back and join us in January. It's going to be a very busy month in politics in January.
It will, merry Christmas. Thanks a lot, Greta.
All right. Hallie Jackson, you just teed up Mister Trump quite well. He's on the phone. Mister Trump, good morning. Good to talk to you as always.
Good morning.
Let me start with this latest tweet that you have talking about Bill Clinton. You said that he had failed badly in the 2008 campaign when he acted as a surrogate for his wife. And you added, he was called a racist. I know you choose your words carefully. Are you yourself calling him a racist?
No. He was called that by the Obama campaign. He was called it loud and clear. He was extremely insulted.
Why did you put it in your tweet --
By the way --
-- if you don't believe it?
They said it. I didn't say it. I didn't call him a racist.
I know but you circulated it to 5.4 million followers, so that would suggest you approve of it.
All I said was what they said, Savannah. That's what they said. They called him a racist. I don't believe he is a racist, if you want to know the truth but they called him a racist. It was a miserable campaign. He did very poorly and, you know, they are bringing him out again. He's being wheeled out, and we're going to see what happens. But frankly, he did very, very poorly. He was not good for her. And obviously she lost to Obama, and that was the end of that, but they brought him out before.
You also said that he has -- this is a different tweet, quote, "A terrible record of women abuse" and I -- I wondered if you could get specific about that. What do you mean? What are you referring to in particular?
Well, if you look at the different situations, of course, we can name many of them. I can get you a list and I'll have it sent to your office in two seconds. But there were certainly lot of abuse of women. And you look at whether it's Monica Lewinsky or Paula Jones or many of them and -- that certainly will be fair game. Certainly if they play the woman's card with respect to me, that will be fair game.
You mentioned Monica Lewinsky -- Lewinsky. Are you saying an alleged extra marital affair that, of course, he's now admitted, is that fair game in a campaign?
Guess what, it's not alleged.
Yeah.
Is that alleged? I don't think that's alleged.
No, he's admitted it. He's admitted it.
Well, if he's admitted it, you don't have to use the word alleged.
Right, which is -- exactly. So are you saying an extra marital affair by Bill Clinton is fair game and something that you think should be in the campaign?
I'm -- I'm -- I'm not saying. What I'm saying is very simple. If she is going to play the woman card because I'll do more for women than Hillary Clinton is going to do for women including the safety of our country which is good for everybody. But if she's going to play, which she started about a week ago, talking about, oh, he mentioned and, you know, the -- the whole thing, playing up the woman's card very, very strongly. And if she's going to play that game and if he's going to be out there campaigning, then he's certainly fair game, and I think just about everybody agrees with me on that. This is a person who, you know, he's -- he's going to be out and I like the fact that he's campaigning for her. He failed in 2008. He failed really badly. He frankly did a very poor job in campaigning, if you want to know the truth and perhaps he'll do well or perhaps he'll do poorly. But if she's going to play the woman card, it's all fair game.
You mentioned the Monica Lewinsky issue. In 2008 on CNN you called the effort to impeach Bill Clinton for that nonsense and totally unimportant. Do you still feel that way or have you had a change of heart?
Well, you know, I tell this to everybody. I got along as a what they -- I'm -- I'm dubbed as a world class businessman, which frankly that's what I am, and I got along with everybody. I got along with the Clintons. I got along with the Republicans, the Democrats, the liberals, the conservatives. That was my obligation. As a businessman, I had to get along with everybody, and I'll be able to do that as President. I'll be able to bring people together, but I got along with the Clintons and I got along with everybody virtually because that was when I needed approvals, when I needed something from Washington, I always got what I wanted and that's because I was able to get along with everybody.
But does --
So when I was --
-- you got along, but did you secretly not feel that way about them?
So Savannah -- Savannah -- no, no, let me just tell you. So when I was a businessman, I had an obligation to myself, my family, my company to get along with everybody and I did that probably better than most.
All right, Mister Trump. I'm out of time. We'll have to leave it there. We hope to talk to you again soon. Thank you so much.
OK. Thank you very much.
Right.
I think we're going to do great there.
Fantastic. Well, we certainly appreciate it. And I want to make sure you get Melania time as well. She's a wonderful, wonderful woman.
She is.
So we are excited about that. Thank you so much. We will let you get to Iowa.
I will. I will be going to Iowa right now. Thank you very much, Kimberly.
Let me ask you some questions about the presidency and a Trump presidency.
OK.
So, you think...
You don't -- the problem with the computer age is, I don't think you have secrecy anymore.
So, you would leave open the possibility of spying on anybody, even allies?
I would say that I would leave open possibilities of doing whatever it takes to make our country very, very strong and to make our country great again.
Let's talk politics for a minute.
OK.
You said that Senator Cruz appeared to be kind of copying your immigration plan. Your plan, as I understand it, is deportations, and then you will let the good ones back in once they have left the country. His plan...
Yes. Well, they have to go through a process.
Last question. Any New Year's resolution?
Make our country great again.
All right, Mr. Trump, thanks so much.
Thank you very much.
Joining us this morning, Republican presidential candidate, Mr. Donald J. Trump. Mr. Trump, do you have us on the phone?
I do.
Happy new year to you, sir.
Thank you. I think we have plenty to talk about based on that introduction.
Beautiful. We have the ad out this morning. It is simple. It is direct. Some will argue it is divisive. In it you say that there must be a temporary ban of Muslims because of Islamic extremism. You say we must build a wall and Mexico will pay for it. How do you get those things done?
Through competence, through knowing what to do, through knowing how to negotiate. Mexico is making an absolute fortune with this country. They're taking our money left and right because we have people who are incompetent running our country. All countries are taking advantage of us. I mean, you can look at virtually every country that does business with us, I will tell you, Chris, they take our money because we have people that don't know what they're doing or they get someone with another agenda. I don't happen to believe that, but some of the deals are so bad, so stupid, that I'd say they maybe have another agenda. You know, between their lobbyists and their special interests because unlike me, they all get money from big lobbyists and big special interests. I'm self-funding my campaign.
So --
And it's a disgrace what's going on and it's a disgrace how our politicians are acting and what they did last week with the budget was incredible, it went so fast. It went like a bullet. We're talking about bullets and guns today, that went like a bullet the way they approved that budget. I have no idea why and how they approved such a horrible budget. Obama got every single thing he wanted, including having lots of people come into this country that shouldn't be coming in.
You mention bullets. The president is going to sign executive orders, he says. We're going to find out more details about them. They do seem to be aimed at closing the gun show loophole and putting more money into existing gun law enforcement. What is wrong with that?
Pretty soon you won't be able to get guns. It's another step in the way of not getting guns. You know, the one thing that is -- just before we even get to that -- is the executive order concept. You know, it's supposed to be negotiated. You're supposed to cajole, get people in a room, you're supposed to deal with them, you have Republicans, you have Democrats, you have all these people, they get elected to do this stuff and you're supposed to get together and pass a law. He doesn't want to do that because it's too much work. So he doesn't want to work too hard. He wants to go back and play golf.
What do you do when the other side doesn't want to negotiate and you find something that you want to do that you think is right? Then what do you do?
He's been away for two weeks playing golf, OK, you know, he's not exactly trying very hard to get it done.
All presidents go on vacation. You know that, Mr. Trump.
He's now just using the executive orders. And he said, you know, look, I'll sign it. I'll be out of here by the time the courts rule on all of this stuff. Look at what happened at the border. He did an executive order a couple of years ago. Now the courts have, actually amazingly, the courts have been on our side, meaning the people's side. And they've --
Which side are you on? You've said in the past that there should be a quick period where people can figure out whether or not they need a gun. I think you commented 72 hours we should be able to tell. So you're for background checks, right?
Right now there's been tremendous laws put on the books already. You know, nobody ever talks about the mental health aspect, the people that actually pull the trigger of the guns. They don't talk about that, Chris. All over the country they're closing up mental health hospitals for budget reasons. People don't talk about that. They talk about the guns. If people in Paris had guns, you know what, you wouldn't have had 130 people and many more to follow get killed. If people in California had a couple of guns in that room, you wouldn't have had 16 people killed, people laying in the hospital.
We don't know that. You would like to believe that if people have guns they'd be able to defend themselves and that there would be less --
I think so, Chris. I mean, I really do. At least we'd have a shot. They have no shot.
Look -- we understand.
The people in Paris and the people in California had zero shot.
Right. No, I was there -- I was at Ft. Hood. We all understand the pain that goes into one of these situations and the frustration. But it gets complex, right? I mean, you say nobody talks about the mentally ill. We do a lot on this show.
But you think we should have a gun-free zone on a military base, Chris?
Well look, I mean, obviously that's not my call. They did it for a reason, if you were to talk to the people in charge of that --
What's the reason? You know, you wonder what is the reason.
Well they have operational security issues, they have maintenance of their firearms. They have protection of those on base. They've had problems in the past. But that's somewhat of a side issue to something else you mentioned.
You know, whenever I see gun-free zone, I see that's a flag for the wackos to come in and start shooting people. That's what I see.
But not for these gun shows.
And frankly, you know, if you want to get to it. What I do see is I do see step by step by step and then all of a sudden you have no Second Amendment. I do see that happening. You'll have steps, these little baby steps, and some of them aren't so baby. Now in all fairness, I don't know what Obama is proposing because nobody has really said what he is proposing.
We have it out. Look, he's got to give us the details. But he's saying close the gun show loophole. And obviously you know what that is. But just for the audience, is that when you go to one of these shows, there's a lot of private-to-private sellers as opposed to someone who is a dealer. They get to transfer arms in a way that you wouldn't be able to otherwise. He's saying make it uniform. Many advocates say that. Same background check that applies to when you go to the gun shop should apply when you go to the gun show. Do you have a problem with that?
Right. Well I have to look at what he says. I really do. I want see what he says, I want to see why he couldn't get this approved by Congress. Why can't he go in and get this approved? You know, you do have to ask that question, Chris. Why can't you, if something is so seemingly cut and dry, as you'd like to say it is, why can't the system work the way it was supposed to be, you know, the way it was supposed to be working, or the way it was designed? Why isn't he getting the Republicans and Democrats together and doing something? Instead of always sign -- He keeps signing executive orders because he doesn't meet with people. I don't know. He doesn't like people, I guess.
No, I don't --
And I'm sure maybe they could come up with some kind of a plan. But don't you think he should do this with Congress? I don't think he works very hard at it. OK? I don't think he -- I don't hear massive meetings taking place where they're all coming in and discussing guns and they're discussing what to do. I don't hear that. All I hear is he's going to sign an executive order and the reason is, he can't get it approved.
There's no question that Congress --
Chris, if he's even tried. I don't know that he even tries. I don't know that he even --
I think there have been significant efforts made.
I think he just signs executive orders.
I think there have been significant efforts made. I think you can do a quick Google search and see that. There's just a lot of politics of opposition around this issue.
Maybe he doesn't know how to get a deal done.
That's your opinion. You're welcome --
You know, maybe -- I mean that's based on the deal he made with Iran and now you look at what Iran is doing, certainly he can't make a deal very well because that's the worst deal I think I've ever seen made.
You've said that many times.
Regardless of what is proposed, this is proposed through an executive order.
Right.
It shouldn't be.
One of the things that goes into this is the politics of opposition. Right? Politics has become a very ugly game. That takes to us our next issue.
It's always been an ugly game.
Right. But it's especially ugly right now.
I mean, it was an ugly game with Reagan and Tip O'Neill, buy they got along and they got a lot of things done.
And there is fair criticism on that basis about why doesn't more get done down in D.C. So that's gets us to the election, which the election be about. We have plenty of problems, you outline them well all the time. You say you're going to "make America great again." Is part of making us great again getting back into the weeds with Bill Clinton and his sex life? That seems to be a big point of emphasis for you now. Why are you doing that?
Only because I was mentioned during the course of the debate nine times. None of the other candidates, Republican candidates, mentioned at all. The last person that Hillary Clinton wants to run against, and I know this for a fact, because as you know, I know many people on the Clinton side, I know people on all sides.
Sure. They were at your wedding.
As a businessman, I got along with everybody. I did well -- Nobody did it better than me. I get along with everybody. It was my obligation to my company, my family, myself to get along with Clinton and to get along with every person that I needed to get along with. I got along great with everybody. I know many of the people in the Clinton campaign. The last person they want to run against is Donald Trump, believe me.
What does that have to do with you bringing Bill Clinton's sex life up?
Well, it's very simple. They, during the course of the debate and many other times, she was talking about, she used the word "sexist." I'm sexist. She was using very sort of derogatory terms. I said how the hell can she do that when she's got one of the great women abusers of all time sitting at her house, waiting for her to come home for dinner.
Why do you call him one of the great women abusers of all time when in the past you've said that the impeachment process against him didn't make sense? You said Monica Lewinsky didn't make sense.
I had because I was on their side. Again -- Chris, as a businessman, I got along with everybody. So it was always important to defend people when I was -- It was important for me to get along with the Clintons.
But it sounds to people --
Whether she was a senator, whether she was a Secretary of State.
Right. But it sounds like your morality shifts based on your motivation.
No, no. As a -- One of the magazines recently said, Trump was a world and -- Well I guess I'm not now because I'm supposed to be a politician. But it's a bad name, you know, being a politician is a little bit of bad name to me, frankly. But I guess that's what I am. But when I was a businessman, they said I was great business man, a world-class businessman. I got along with Clinton and everybody. I got along with Harry Reid. I got along with everybody.
Right. But I'm saying, you know, leadership is about consistency. You said it in your book, 'The Art of the Deal." Your most recent book, too, you talk about the consistency needed in leadership. One minute you said -- well not one minute -- Years ago you said Monica Lewinsky, they shouldn't have chased after it like this. Bill Clinton's sex life shouldn't be an issue. Now you're saying it's like one of the main issues. How is a voter supposed to see you for that?
No, no -- I tried to help them a little bit because they were -- it was important for me, as Secretary of State, as a senator, to have all these people on my side. I needed votes for things. I got many things done. I needed votes. I would have these people on my side. So I wasn't going to get involved in the Monica Lewinsky thing. And I wouldn't get involved in it now.
You're bringing it up.
I don't really care about Monica Lewinsky other than I think that Hillary was an enabler and a lot of things happened that were obviously very seedy. I mean, he was impeached, for heaven's sake. He was impeached over this stuff.
But that was a political process, right? The Senate wound up not going along with it. He wound up being one of the most popular presidents in history.
He paid a massive fine on one of the cases, like a massive fine. He was -- I think his law degree was even taken away, he wasn't able to practice law. So obviously it was a big thing. But I would always stick up when I -- as a businessman, I would always stick up for various people, whether they were friends or not, because in many cases I needed them, I needed their votes to get things done.
So what you're saying is that back then when you needed them, you were OK with what Bill Clinton was doing. But now that you want to take votes from his wife, you're not OK with what he was doing.
No. You have to understand, they called me sexist. And all of a sudden --
Yeah, they called you that because of what you said about women. Not because of --
She comes out and starts going -- and the reason that happened, Chris, it was very simple. The reason that happened is because I'm doing very well in the polls. In some polls I'm beating her and I think I'm going to beat her easily if I get the nomination. I think I'm going to beat her easily.
I understand. But you have to remember, the reason it happened is because of what you said during the first debate about women and how you went at it with Megyn Kelly and then what you said about Carly Fiorina --
What did I do with Megyn Kelly? I didn't do -- She asked me a totally inappropriate first question and I fought her. If a male asked me that same question, I would have hit him just as hard. What Megyn Kelly did, she asked me a totally nonsense question and I fought her.
I'm just saying, that's where it came from. Hillary Clinton didn't bring it out of nowhere. You got a lot of criticism for that.
By the way, I said nothing wrong to Megyn Kelly. I fought her properly. And if it was a male, I would have fought him the same way.
I'm well aware with your fighting techniques, Mr. Trump. It makes you a very challenging interview. Thank you for discussing the issues of the day. I appreciate it and a good new year to you, sir.
You too, Chris. Thank you very much.
All right.
They want to hear about ISIS and they want to hear, about you know, how we are going to get rid of ISIS and how we are going to destroy ISIS.
So you don't think the video is a little misleading with the talk of the border fence for Mexico? You use a Morocco video.
No. I think it's irrelevant.
You don't think that's misleading.
No. I think it's irrelevant. All we want to do is what it's going to look like. They picked something. They could have picked something else. We could have picked plenty of footage -- that I can tell you, Bill.
All right. So you would go into Saudi Arabia --
We made a power out of Iran.
So you -- if they --
We made a power out of Iran with the deal.
But we will be almost a mercenary state -- if we accept money to defend countries.
Call it whatever you want. Hey -- call it whatever you want. If you want to use that term, you can. You can also say we are smart. But we can't continue to defend everybody and lose on every single thing we do. We have to rebuild our country. Our country is a mess. Our infrastructure's crumbling and we owe $19 trillion.
If you are elected president, are you going to take military action against Iran? Are you going to do something to that country?
Well, I would want to help Saudi Arabia. I would want to protect Saudi Arabia. But Saudi Arabia is going to have to help us economically. They were making, before the oil went down -- now they are making half. But they were making a billion dollars a day.
Yes, but you're dodging my question. Would you take action against Iran militarily if you are president?
Depending on what the deal is, I would have to do that. I would defend certain groups of people over there. The deal we made with Iran is a disaster. The deal we made for $150 billion is a total disaster.
So you would revoke that deal.
And you know that Iran is going to have a nuclear weapon very soon. Bill -- Iran is going to have a nuclear weapon very soon. And they have already violated their deal. The deal is -- the ink isn't even dry, and they have already violated the deal and a lot of people are calling for sanctions.
Ok. But don't the voters have a right to know --
I don't want to tell you exactly what I'm going to do.
I got it. But just keep in mind though -- voters would want to know how militaristic you are going to get. I've got one final question. Did you give an interview to Esquire?
I disagree with that. I think they want to see a certain amount of unpredictability.
Did you give an interview to Esquire magazine? Did you do that?
I gave a short interview. I haven't heard about it but I gave a short interview.
They are killing you. Why did you do that? They're killing you. They got on the cover "Hater in Chief" with a bad picture of you. Why would you talk to Esquire Magazine? You know they are going to hammer you.
I do, if you think about a Hater in Chief. I do hate what's happening to America.
That's not what they get. They are calling you a bigot and everything else. You know that?
Well they can call me that. Then I guess they just, you know, look, it's the mainstream media stuff. They go that way. But I do hate what's happening to America so in that way maybe it's a very accurate depiction. I do hate to see --
That's a good spin on it. I was surprised you talk to these guys. They're not looking out for you, Donald. They are just not.
Well, I mean I understand. We get a very unfair press. I get a very, very unfair press.
So why do you even give them the opportunity to do that you? You're like giving them the hammer. I don't know.
Because I'm always giving people a chance to be fair, Bill -- always.
Mr. Trump?
Yes.
You put out a tweet today suggesting that you jump the shark on this one, you haven't been critical from them, but now it seems you're stepping up that criticism?
No, this was a really a question given to me. I know nothing about it and I really know nothing about it and hope it's -- I hope this would not be a reason for disqualification. So hopefully he'll have the answers.
You got a big endorsement today Andrew Hemingway...
Yes.
All right, here to respond is the man himself, 2016 Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, good to see you.
Hello, Sean.
Happy New Year. All right, number one...
You, too, happy New Year.
I think...
I'm doing that to straighten out the country. And I'm doing it to make America great again, as per my team, but make America great again. I understand how they feel. I'm not part of the establishment.
What should the Republicans...
But in the meantime things are -- what's happening is the government is being run much differently than what our founders had in mind. I mean, he's signing executive orders on things that -- this is the 2nd Amendment. This is a very important thing to people. And you're not supposed to just say we're making changes without having it go through a process of having other people agree with you...
Well, I...
... and, you know, through a negotiation. It's unbelievable what's happening!
You're talking about co-equal branches of government, separation of powers. Now, the president himself said 25 times before he issued his immigration executive action that he didn't have the authority or the power to do it, but he did it anyway. The Republicans didn't stop him.
That's right.
I agreed with you.
... and have plenty left over for other things.
Let me ask you...
I said, Keep it.
He just won't do it. Let me ask you something about Ted? I actually, I -- there's a legal mind on the conservative side that has been saying that he has concerns that Ted Cruz may not be qualified of the president of the United States, may not meet the qualifications.
Because of where he was born.
Right.
... you need a person with tremendous strength and stamina.
Because they get the jobs based on who they contribute to.
Sure, that's the way the system works, and it's no good. I will have the greatest business -- and you know what the greatest business? People in the world.
Right.
I will have the greatest business men and women in the world. I already know who they are. And sure, it's like -- I'll take a Carl Icahn who has already endorsed me. I'll say Carl, good luck. Handle China.
Yeah.
The end result will be, we will do very well. We have the best in the world, we don't use them.
... but they're not attacking you any more.
I was mentioned -- I was mentioned -- I was attack nine times during the debate.
Right, right.
Hillary called me sexist, that I had an inclination. What does she know about me? I had an inclination. When she said that, I said, "Well, your husband is now campaigning, it's open season." Now, if he wasn't campaigning, maybe it would be different, and if he weren't a past president, it would be totally different. It would be -- you know, I would leave the spouse out of it.
You're saying today, you're only going to bring up Bill Clinton's past history as a possible sexual harasser, if she accuses you of being sexist?
Sure, that's what it's all about. That's what it was.
But if she attacked -- but it -- I want to clear this up, because the press is having a field day and they're not getting it right.
I haven't noticed it.
So, if you...
You're having a field day, I noticed...
Suddenly, you -- so, suddenly, you like the press. I don't understand that, I'm a little confused.
Yeah, they're starting to like me, they're starting to get it. They're actually starting to get it.
So, what I'm saying is, I want to make it clear and a lot of people want to hear this, so, if Hillary Clinton attacks you on economics or on foreign policy, then Bill Clinton isn't fair game in that realm.
Yeah.
It's only if she accuses you of being sexist?
Now, he would be fair game if he did something or said something that having to do with foreign policy and other things I disagreed with.
But you wouldn't attack him with a personal front?
No, I wouldn't need to. No, I wouldn't need to.
OK.
There's so many things I can attack them on.
Right.
I mean, you look at Iran, you look at the Iran deal, you look at so many of these things that took place. In 2009, Iran was ready to explode. We could overthrown Iran by just giving support to the protesters. They were protesting -- a little bit of support. A little bit of help. And Iran would have blown up.
I was talking about it yesterday morning. Your agent told you not to do it.
That's true.
It would destroy your career, and we won't say his name.
That's right.
And you did it anyway.
And a good agent and a good guy, but he really felt...
Right.
So, it's one of the...
Less than a month.
Yeah. February 1st.
It's...
So we better get involved. You know, we work on Iran making the worst deal probably I've ever seen made, but at least they don't quite yet -- they will have nukes soon because the deal is so bad, but they don't have nukes now. He actually has them and we don't do anything.
In Reuters.
... on everybody.
OK. Because he was born in Canada to an American mom. All right. Donald Trump, thank you very much. We know you've got to go run your empire now.
OK. Thank you very much.
He says he's a natural born sit step because his mother was U.S. Born, a U.S. citizen, as a result, he's a natural-born citizen.
I hope he's right. I want to win this thing fair and square. I don't want to win on this point. What the Democrats are saying is he had a passport.
He says he didn't have a passport. He may have been eligible for a Canadian passport.
I think it would be wonderful if he didn't. Everybody tells me he had a joint passport.
He had a Canadian birth certificate because he was born in Canada.
Here's what I think. What I think I'd do. I'd go and seek a declaratory judgment if I was Ted.
What does that mean?
It means you go to court.
Which court?
You go to federal court to ask for what's called a declaratory judgment. You seek the judgment of the court. Without a court case. You go right in. You go before a judge. You do it quickly. It can go quickly. I've used it on numerous occasions. So when there's a doubt -- because there's a doubt. What Ted doesn't want to happen is he doesn't want to be in there, I mean, I think I'm going to win. I'm leading in either poll by a lot. But I have a lot of friends in the Republican Party. I have a lot of friends all over the place, all right. If Ted should eke it out, and I hope that doesn't happen, and he's got this cloud over his head, I don't think it's going to be possible for him to do very well. I don't think it's possible for the Republicans to let it happen. Because he'll have this cloud. What you do, you go in immediately, like tomorrow, this afternoon. You go to federal court. You ask for a declaratory judgment. And once the court rules, you have your decision.
That could take a long time. I don't think the Supreme Court has ever really ruled on what is a natural-born citizen.
That's the problem. There's this doubt. People have doubt. Again, this was not my suggestion. I didn't bring this up. A reporter asked me the question. But the Democrats have brought it up. And you had somebody, a Congressman, say no matter what happened, we're going to be suing on this matter. That's a tough matter for Ted. Again, I didn't bring it up, Wolf, this is brought up and this was asked of me as a question. It's not the first time it's been asked but it's being asked by a lot of different people to a lot of different people that are running.
His mother was a U.S. citizen, born in Kansas. Was he a natural-born citizen?
Who knows? Who cares right now? We're talking about something else, OK. I have my own theory on Obama. Some day I'll give -- I'll write a book. I'll do another book. It will do very successfully. Look, with Ted, she should have for a declaratory judgment. I'm doing this for the good of Ted. I like him. We have a good relationship. Go into court. Ask for a judgment. The judge will rule. And once a judge rules that he's OK, then the Democrats can't bring a lawsuit later on.
He also says he's tougher on illegal immigration in the United States than you are. You say you will deport all the undocumented immigrants in the United States. 11 million, 12 million, as many as there are. But the good ones you say can come back to the United States. He says he's not letting any of these immigrants come back to the United States.
Ted was in favor of amnesty. Him and Marco Rubio have been fighting about who's weaker. Now all of a sudden -- and I was watching Ted the other day and it was very interesting. He said, and we must build a wall. OK. And my wife said, darling, he just said build a wall. That's the first person who said build a wall. I've been saying it for five years. But he said, and we will build a wall. So now he's taking my idea for the wall. I'm glad he's taking it. I think it's the right thing to do. The problem is I'll build a wall. It will be the right wall. Politicians don't know how to build walls. And I'll have Mexico pay for the wall. All of a sudden, they're trying to come over into my territory. No, we will get people out. The people that come back will come back legally. They will come back legally. We'll have a country again. We're going to have strong borders. Border Patrol people are fantastic. I got to know them very well. But we're going to have a wall. I heard just the other day Ted said he never said about a wall before. All of a sudden, he's talking about a wall.
He says he's not going to let any of those illegal immigrants come back to the United States.
I think you should come back if they're very good people. Let them come back legally. I want people to come back. I'm building a wall but I want people to come in. I want immigrants to come in but they have to come in legally. I want a lot of people to in. I want to have really smart people, really good people, really hard workers come back in. But they have to come in legally. So I want people to come back in to the country.
Let's talk a little bit about the wall you want to build. How long would it take to build that wall?
It will go very quickly. I would get the environmental impacts. Part of the reason the wall wasn't built, they couldn't get an environmental impact statement approved. Can you believe it? The environmental impact statement for a wall. We're looking for, you know, almost you could say military purposes. As an example, in the south China sea, China building islands. Massive islands. Military bases. They're taking out and they're drenching the sea. They're dredging the ocean. They don't go about --
You say Mexico's going to pay for the wall?
Mexico's going to pay.
Eventually, you'll send bail, how will they do that?
I'll charge them a tariff. Look, Mexico, I'm very friendly with Mexico. I employ thousands of people that, you know, Mexicans, they're great people. They like me. I'm doing very well by the way with the Hispanics and you saw in Nevada I'm leading in the polls with Hispanics. Because I create jobs. I'm going to take jobs back from China. I create jobs. Here's the thing. Mexico's making a fortune. Look at the trade deficit we have with Mexico. They're making a fortune. Ford's going to build a $2.5 billion plant in Mexico. Nabisco is moving their big plant, their big plant, from Chicago to Mexico.
You know, the Saudis hated this nuclear deal with Iran.
I hated it more than them.
I know you hated it.
Israel hated it.
They all hated it. Are you concerned the Saudis, now given this tension with Iran, Saudi Arabia may decide, you know what, we're going to go buy a nuclear bomb maybe from Pakistan or some place like that? The nuclear proliferation issue is really serious.
I said that that deal, I said it to CNN, to anybody that will listen, is going to lead to great nuclear proliferation and that's what's happening.
About 40,000 U.S. troops in Germany right now, 70 years after World War II.
They pay us practically nothing. They are a behemoth economically. They have tremendous money. One of the things I'd do very early, I want to protect a lot of people but they have to help us. They have to help us economically. We are becoming a third world country. We are a debtor nation, $19 trillion. The new very dumb budget that was approved by everybody two weeks ago, that's going to add at least another $2 trillion. So we're at $21 trillion.
Can I show this, for example? You don't want bad people to get access to guns.
When you get into the gun show, it's a slippery slope. That stops a father from giving his child a gun.
Because background checks make sense, right?
We have to protect the Second Amendment. We have no choice. We have to do that. It's very important. I believe it in from a safety standpoint. And Hillary is a disaster. Hillary wants to take the guns away from Americans. Hillary's going to be worse than Obama. Hillary, I can't imagine this, she wants to take the guns. You know, it's interesting, in California, when you had the two people, those two horrible people, shoot people that gave them a wedding party. These people that got killed gave them a wedding party. Anyway, they went in, they shot. If a couple of people in that room had guns or if a couple of people in Paris had guns, you wouldn't have had 130 people or 14 people in California with more to follow because you have so many people so badly wounded. If people in Paris as an example, which is the toughest gun control place on earth they say, Paris and France, you can't -- if you're a bad guy, you can have a gun. If area good guy, you can't. If they had guns right here on their ankle and those guys walked in there and started shooting, it would have been a much different story. So and, you know, it's very interesting, so many people that believe in the gun control, when we have these debates, they always use the debate to me and then I call them up the next day. So how do you feel about it? Well, I still haven't changed my mind. I don't know what it is. We need the Second Amendment. But if it is going to be changed, it's got to be done through a process, not through executive orders.
Donald, nice to talk to you.
Hi, Greta.
All right. But that's a different issue. Libya, Saudi Arabia, the Middle East and Secretary Clinton for the four years that she was Secretary of State and before that senator. That's different from -- I mean, the hit you are doing on her now has to do with her personal story.
No, it's just a response to what they said about me. It's nothing more than a response. And I think it's very accurate and I think it's a very good response. And it's one of those things. I mean, when they hit, they get hit back. It's one of those things. I have to do it.
All right.
I think that's what he should do, frankly. But, again, Greta, this is not my issue. This was just a question that was asked of me. And, you know, I don't care about this issue. I want to win on the merits on my own merits. I don't want to win because of something like this.
Thank you, Donald for joining us.
Thank you very much, Greta.
Mr. Trump, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.
Thank you.
The stock market has dropped dramatically in recent days in large part because of fears about the Chinese economy. What would President Trump do about the markets?
Well, if they would have been listening to me over the last six years, we are so tied into China, when China goes bad, we go bad. We're just tied in, and we're tied into their advantage, not to our advantage. What we have to do is be smart. They want to, as you know, they want to continue to devalue their currency in order to devalue out. But what that's doing, it's stopping our companies from being able to compete with China, and other places, including Japan -- which, by the way, is doing big devaluations. Not good for us. Anytime you see these countries devaluing their currency, that's a bad thing for us. And, China wants to do that now again to get itself out of a problem.
Why should Republican voters in Iowa, more than half of whom say that they're either Evangelicals, or Born-Again Christians, why should they choose you over Ted Cruz?
Well, I'll tell you what. I've formed a great bond in Iowa, I'm doing very well with the Evangelicals. I'm Protestant, I'm Presbyterian, I have a great bond with Evangelicals -- and, by the way with the Tea Party, and you see that in your polls. I'm doing very well with them, with both --
Why would they pick you over Cruz?
Because I think that I will be much better on illegal immigration, I will be much better on security, I will be much better on the military, I will be much better on the economy. I mean, the economy's my thing.
Let me ask you about immigration because Cruz says that he's tougher than you when it comes to immigration. Your policy is you want to deport all of the illegals out, and then let what you call "the good ones " back in. He says if you're deported, you never get back in.
He's changed what he's done. He's also said the other day for the first time, "we have to build a wall, we have to build a wall." He never talked about building a wall.
Now, there's also the question that you have raised in the last few days about whether or not Ted Cruz is a natural born a citizen...
I didn't raise it, The Washington Post  raised it. They asked me a question, I said, "I really don't know." I know he was born in Canada, I know he was -- I think he was a Canadian citizen, along with, maybe, he had a joint, but he was a Canadian-American --
I know. But people say you're trolling him.
I'm not trolling.
But he says it's not an issue, and in fact when you raised it, he posted a video of the Fonz jumping the shark, and --
OK, look --
Well, you have mentioned them both in the same sentence, and the reason I ask is --
I mean, it's not up to me...
-- as inappropriate as his relationship with Monica Lewinsky may have been, since she was an intern --
Well, you're not talking about Monica, you're talking about many.
Now, a lot of Republican officials, including a lot of Republican women say that's going to backfire. That, you're going to make her more popular. Once again, she's the victim, that it's going to turn a lot of...
No, no. She's not a victim. She was an enabler -- she
So, what would you do?
I would get China, and I would say, "Get in there, and straighten it out. You'd better straighten it out." And, if you don't straighten it out, we're going to have trouble because we have power over China. We have trade power over China. And, Obama doesn't understand, he's not a business person.
There have been several terrorist -- domestic terrorist incidents recently. There were two Syrian refugees who were arrested for trying to support ISIS in Syria. There was a cop who was shot in Philly, and the person who shot him said he was doing out of his allegiance to ISIS.
We have to be very strong, we have to be very -- look. If we're not vigilant in this country, we're not going to have a country left. You look at what's happening in Brussels, and you look at what's happening in Germany, and you look at what's happening in Paris, and so many places. We have to be vigilant.
We hear about Bush Doctrine, an Obama Doctrine, is there a Trump Doctrine on foreign policy?
Yes.
You have had remarkable success as a Republican candidate. Lord knows you surprised me, but, there are people who say if you should actually become the nominee, and be in the general election, you're going to have problems. You're going to have to reach out to Hispanics, to minorities, to women, to independents, that you're going to have to move to the center, and you're going to have to tone it down.
Look, all I can tell you is what I can tell you. You said I wouldn't run. Most people -- like you, said, I don't want him on this program because he's not going to run. OK, so I ran...
Mr. Trump --
Thank you.
-- thank you.
Thank you.
So...
... It's not doing well. The country's not doing well, and I think now the stock market maybe is catching up with the country.
... Right...
... And, all it means is businesses are going to be unable to compete with China.
Just to be clear, I want to get to North Korea for sure, Mr. Trump, but, you did say you want to have a 45% tariff on exports coming into this country, correct?
No, no, I said that if they don't behave then...
... Then you're going to put a 45%...
... that would be a number, that would commensurate...
... tariff...
... Yeah.
Right...
... And, I said, if they don't behave, if they don't stop doing what they're doing with the devaluations in particular. I also said we'd do something if they don't solve the North Korean problem because they can solve it -- they can solve it with a phone call, OK? That's the power they have over North Korea...
... So, my question is...
... And, if they don't solve it, I would think about doing a tariff, or a tax, on goods coming in. Yes, I would.
Forty-five percent?
No, it could be as high as 45% percent. What I said is the number that they should pay based on the kind of destruction that they've done with their devaluation is the equivalent of a 45% tax.
OK, so, wouldn't that make American products that much more expensive for the American consumer? You're talking about...
... Well, it may, but, you'd also make...
You were talking about business, and Wall Street, at your rally over the weekend, and...
... Right...
Right, so...
... Because, if the bubble -- if the bubble's going to explode I'd rather have it explode before the next president, rather than after the next president...
... So, you think there's more selling to come? Do you think this bubble, as you call it, continues to burst?
Yeah, yeah I think there's more to come. I think a lot of these companies -- I'm looking at these internet companies, where they make, you know, here we go again with the Internet. But -- but I'm looking at a lot of the company -- the tech companies, and they don't make money. And, you know, with all of the problems, and everything else, they don't make money, and they're setting new records, in terms of stock price, and we've seen that pony before, haven't we?
So -- Absolutely. In the 1990's, for sure. So, I guess voters really want to understand better what are you going to do with taxes? You say, you know, you're going to make sure to keep Wall Street accountable. You mentioned carried interest, now, in other words, you don't want hedge fund managers to be able to manipulate earnings, and call it capital gains when it's really...
... We want it to be fair...
... more income to the very to
... Look, I'm a big fan -- I'm a big fan...
... Right...
... Then you have far more money than want to borrow. The banks aren't loaning money. So, these people want to start businesses in our country, they can't do it. And, I'll sometimes call a banker giving a reference to a friend of mine that wants to start a little business, and the banker will say, "Donald, you have no idea how bad it is. We don't run the banks anymore. They're run by the regulators."
Real quick...
... Yes...
... Donald, you said, in terms of national security, you know, when it comes to -- when it comes to Russia, and ISIS, you said, look let Russia fight in Syria. Just at the beginning of the interview, you said, look, you know, North Korea's China's biggest problem, let China deal with it. How do you justify America leading, if, in fact, you're saying let everybody else fight these battles, and fight the bad actors.
... Well...
... Is that America leading the war...
... Maria, look the way -- the way I look at it...
Donald Trump, good to have you on the program this morning. Thanks so much. I'm going to see you on Thursday in South Carolina...
... I look forward to it...
... at the next GOP debate.
I look very much forward to it.
And, I as well. Thank you very much, Donald Trump.
Thank you very much.
If you got out of the race today, do you feel like you have won something?
No, I don't. I really don't. I think that the "Time " article was incredibly well written. It was really -- I mean that is a good writer, I will tell you that, a professional. But I feel that if I don't win all of it, and I mean the Presidency, that I've wasted my time. I know I've been given accolades for the job we've done and everything else, especially --
You've shifted the debate.
-- well, especially being somewhat of a novice. And I've been, you know, I've been -- people have said very nice things, like "Time Magazine " but I really feel that if I don't win I can't make the difference.
You know there's this running conventional wisdom about you with some in the establishment that now say OK, he's here to stay but if he doesn't win Iowa, he'll leave the race.
No, I'm not leaving. No, I'm not leaving. You and I had us this discussion about two months ago where you said would you leave. I was in number. I've been in number one just about since I joined up -- right -- June 16, amazing. We had a lot of fun but you asked me that question.
Yes.
I started talking about well, maybe here, maybe there, if this happens.
There's no maybes anymore?
There's no maybes. There's no maybes. I'm not leaving.
You're going straight to the convention?
Going all the way. If I don't win, I don't win. Maybe that can happen but I'm leading every poll big.
You don't accept the idea that you might lose Iowa? You could lose it.
I hope I win Iowa. I've developed an amazing relationship with the people of Iowa. You see it right outside. We have a huge audience -- a sold out audience. Always sold out -- I mean no matter where I go. But I have an amazing relationship with evangelicals, with the Tea Party, with the people of Iowa.
Your chief competitor is Ted Cruz. You have brought up the Canadian citizenship issue. But let me ask you your opinion. Do you believe he is constitutionally eligible? I know the Supreme Court has never weighed in on the phrase "natural born citizen " -- what does that mean. But you yourself, do you think he should be eligible?
So what happens is I was watching Lawrence Tribe of Harvard yesterday who's a constitutional expert, one of the true experts. And according to him, it's a real question mark. And he is the -- I would say he was -- is one of the great authorities on this subject. He has a question mark and --
But do you have a question mark?
Let me tell you. From Ted's standpoint and from the party's standpoint, he has to solve this problem because the Democrats will sue him if he's the nominee. If Ted is the nominee, he will be sued by the Democrats and according to one of the great lawyers of the country at Harvard with strong opinions on this, the whole thing has not been this matter -- as he said, this matter has not been determined.
I understand that. I'm talking about your opinion.
I would say that I would want the Supreme Court to rule because they haven't ruled.
Let me ask you about -- you said something about Senator Cruz this week in a CNN interview. You said he was for amnesty. That's a big charge. Of all people to charge being for amnesty, where's the evidence on him?
Well, number one he worked for Bush. Bush was heavy for amnesty.
Where are you on ethanol?
I've been in favor of ethanol.
Let me ask you. Senator Rubio sponsored a bill back in Florida back when he was in the statehouse to give in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants. There's a lot of states that allow in- state tuition for the children of undocumented immigrants. I've not heard your position.
I'm opposed to it.
Totally opposed?
They're here -- they're not here legally.
Even kids born to illegal in Iowa.
Well, I happen to disagree with the whole concept of anchor babies. I mean you look at anchor babies --
How do you decide if someone's a Muslim when you're doing this test?
Well, there's got to be some kind of a method.
How do you this method -- because you're taking somebody's word.
I'm not taking somebody's word.
I understand that. But how do you do it?
Wait a minute -- Chuck.
By the way, they just shipped the uranium out, though. I mean they're living up to the deal.
And where do they ship it? To Russia.
Well, you trust Putin.
Well, I trust him more than some people.
I was just going to say --
I can tell you that. But what kind of a deal is that? Even that -- they're shipping it to Russia, right? Why aren't they shipping it to us? Why aren't we getting it? They're shipping it to Russia. I don't like that.
You don't like that at all?
No. No, I'd like them to ship it to us. It's our deal. So they get $150 billion. We don't even get our prisoners back. They have 24-day periods -- and, by the way, the people don't know, the 24 days doesn't start until a whole procedure takes place. That 24 day can be a longer --
Hard to wipe away nuclear material in 24 days.
I don't know that. And you don't know that.
It is a threat?
Of course, I mean I can call it a nicer name. She was saying he has tendencies towards being sexist.
Talking about who -- you?
About me. And I said wait a minute. She's married to an abuser. A woman claimed rape and all sorts of things -- I mean horrible things. You read the books.
You know though if you bring it up people are going to bring up your --
It's OK.
Your first divorce was ugly.
Number one -- it's fine.
They have.
And I just won the Fox poll against her even. I'm up substantially over Hillary in the Fox poll that just came out.
As you know -- as you know people call you a lot of names -- some of it is positive, some of is negative. I want to throw some by you -- to you. Some people are calling you the music man of this race; Kim Kardashian: Biff from back to the future; George Costanza, PT Barnum. Any of those you consider a compliment?
PT Barnum.
He's been the divider? What about the Republican Party? You don't think they --
No, no, I think --
You don't think this has been a two-way street.
He hasn't brought us -- Chuck, he hasn't brought us together. He hasn't brought --
That's on him? Not on both parties?
I think it's on everybody, but he's the leader. He's the leader. He could have been a great cheerleader and he hasn't been and that's too bad.
Are you going to refuse to do executive orders as president?
I won't refuse it. I won't refuse it.
I understand that, but you're willing to use them, too, yourself?
I won't -- I'm not going to rule it out.
Final question because I know you've got the rally --
I'm going to use them much better and they're going to serve a much better purpose than what he's done.
On Tuesday we're going to hear the President say the state of our union is in some words strong, vibrant, all this stuff. What would you say? One year from now it could be you giving this speech to congress, a version of it -- we don't call it state of the union in the first one, but a joint session speech. How would you describe the state of the union right now?
Now or in a couple of years?
Now or in a year.
I think now it's a mess. Our military --
In that first speech to Congress you're going to lay out your first 100 days agenda. What are those four issues?
I want to build our military bigger and better and stronger than --
There are a bunch of billionaires around the world, Zuckerberg has signed on this idea they want to -- basically give away more than half of their wealth at some point to philanthropic projects. Carl Icahn is the guy who signed on to this.
-- who by the way endorsed me.
Right -- that's what I mean. Good friend of yours. Have you thought about -- I'm sure people have asked you to sign this giving pledge.
They have all asked me. They have all asked me.
His Canadian citizenship, yes.
-- he was a Canadian citizen -- he was a Canadian citizen. So he gave that up probably 14, 15 months ago. The problem is you have a cloud over Ted's head and that is a big problem because I don't know how you solve it, other than going to court and getting a declaratory judgment. I don't see how you can solve it because you know that the Democrats have already announced that they're going to bring a lawsuit.
But do you think it is a mistake that he's robbed of an opportunity to talk to what would still be a substantial audience?
I don't think it's a mistake. I don't think it's either -- I don't think matters. I mean, frankly, for him. I think what he should do is go back and run for the senator of Kentucky and do a good job as a senator. I think it's not going to make any difference but I can fully understand why he wouldn't want to go on the second stage.
All right, Donald Trump, we look forward to seeing in a couple days. Meanwhile, thank you again for stopping by.
Thank you very much, Neil.
Have you seen this fight that has erupted where Jeb Bush is attacking Marco Rubio on amnesty?
I've seen a lot of fights, and the Republicans are fighting each other. They don't seem to be fighting me as much as they're fighting everybody else. Almost, they're not fighting me at all. Jeb has spent a lot of money, though, on commercials, I know, against me. That seems to be the one place. But Jeb is just going down. It's very sad when you look at what happened to Jeb Bush.
So why have you so many conservative leaders -- the Wall Street Journal, Weekly Standard, National Review, lots of them don't think you're a conservative. They would look at what you just said about trade -- they would say protectionism and tariffs, that's not conservative.
No, no, not protectionism -- fairness. China is making hundreds of billions of dollars a year with us. At some point, we have to say, look, you can't do that. I mean we have rebuilt China virtually. Now, I am a free trader, 100 percent. But we can't continue to lose tremendous amounts of money to these countries. We're losing with virtually everybody, everybody that we do business with. The fact is, our leaders have been outsmarted at every step of the game. and we just can't do that.
I read Art of the Deal. And one of the things you write about is you have to be bold, you have to make a splash, you have to attract attention. You've also talked about compromise. There was a time you said there's nothing wrong with compromise -- you just ask for about three times what you want, and then you get what you want.
OK.
So I look at deporting all illegal immigrants. I look at a temporary ban of Muslims coming to the United States. They get a lot of attention. Are they opening positions in a negotiation?
I'm not saying there can't be some give and take, but at some point we have to look at these things. You look at the radical Islamic terrorism and you look at what's going on, we have to take a serious look. There's tremendous hatred. You look at illegal immigration and all that's taking place with respect to illegal immigration, whether it's the crime or the economy, I mean, it affects many different elements. It doesn't mean I'm hard and fast 100 percent, but we to get a lot of what I'm asking for, or we're not going to have a country any more.
So they are opening positions?
They are very strong positions. It doesn't mean you're not going to negotiate a little bit, but I guess there will always be some negotiation. But they are very strong positions, and I would adhere to those positions very strongly. That doesn't mean that at some point we won't talk a little bit about some negotiation. Who wouldn't do that?
A question about abortion. The Mexico City policy, the policy that does not allow federal dollars to go to international groups that perform or support abortions. Reagan instituted it, Clinton got rid of it, George W. Bush reinstated it, Obama got rid of it. If you were president, would you reinstate it?
Yes, I would reinstate it.
The debate is coming up in a day or so. Carly Fiorina and Rand Paul, who were in the main debate, are now out. What's your reaction? You now have seven in the field. Too big?
I like seven better than I like 10. I like seven better than I like eight. The number is getting smaller. I'm very satisfied with that. I'd like to see a smaller group. You know, last time -- 'Please discuss your views on terrorism, you have 30 seconds' -- it's a little bit ridiculous when you think of it. So I like more time. I would prefer having more time. So obviously the fewer people on the stage, the more time you have individually.
Joining me now on the telephone, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, thanks for joining me.
I was just wondering if you have anything positive to say. Beautiful introduction. All negative. But go ahead.
Within the margin of error.
-- statistically. Yes.
Do you have a certain question you want me to ask of him directly from you, if he is your general election contender?
No. Just give him my warmest regards, OK?
I will.
Have a good time. Thank you.
Donald Trump, thank you, sir. Safe travels onto South Carolina tomorrow and thank you for your time today.
Thank you.
Yes.
And -- and very substantial contributions. She was very aggressive, I will tell you that. But I like her. She's a very nice woman. But she's very weak on the subject of illegal immigration. And, you know, that's not something that I care for, in terms of somebody's attitude. She's very, very weak on illegal immigration. And that's no good with me.
And you say, Mr. Trump?
Well, I don't know what she means by take it. Does she mean by taking the campaign contribution? That's almost the way that was worded.
She means taking -- taking her criticism of you.
OK.
Taking -- taking her --
Oh, no, I can take criticism.
So -- so in --
So I have nothing against -- I have nothing at all --
Right.
-- against Nikki Haley. I -- and I will say that she has been to my office on a number of occasions and, you know, campaign contributions. And I have no problem with that. But, you know, I do think that it's something that can be told. But I don't like her stance on illegal immigration.
So are you all right with her speech then? I mean, you know, she's considered a riding -- a rising star in your party. She was hand-picked by the leadership to deliver that prime time response to the president. And Nikki Haley -- a Haley adviser tells our Dana Bash that they took a look at the speech before she delivered it. They read the whole thing. They didn't make any changes. You know, are you OK with that? Do you feel that that was disrespectful of the RNC?
Well, they have to do what they have to do. Erin, they have to do what they have to do. I'm leading by a tremendous amount nationally. I'm leading in every state, including, actually, Iowa, you know, if you look at the recent polls.
Right.
But I'm leading in every state. I'm leading nationally by very, very large numbers. I'm leading in South Carolina, incredible people in South Carolina. And I'm leading by a tremendous amount. And I -- you know, I have a great relationship with the people in South Carolina and -- and I think that they would agree with me more than they would agree with Nikki. But, you know, she can -- you know, I've -- I'm not going to tell her what they say. She's going to have to say whatever she wants. But --
So Nikki Haley, is she still on a list, when you look at possible vice presidential candidates, would you still consider her to be on that list? Bottom line, would you trust her? Would you consider her?
Well, she's not doing real well right now, but I'm sure she would be somebody that would be considered. But I would say right now, she's not exactly doing real well. I mean a very important, you know, thing for me is borders and security. And she's not very strong on those subjects. And that would bother me very much.
Yes.
-- a citizen of the U.S. and Canada until 15 months ago. So, he's got a problem, and the Democrats are going to bring suit. So, how do you have a candidate -- how do we have our candidate -- we say, "Good luck, Ted. Go out there and get it. By the way, the Democrats are saying in court -- and they have brilliant lawyers saying that they're right, that you don't have the right to run." That's a problem. I don't know how he solves it. He's got to go to court and get it solved.
There are many though that think --
-- I mean, he was born --
-- that it's not an issue --
-- In Canada --
-- He -- he was born in --
-- He was born in Canada --
-- He was born in Canada. I mean, hundred percent true, right? But there are a lot of people --
-- Well there are many people --
-- Even Republicans say this whole conversations absurd. I mean, I talked to Governor Kasich about it --
-- No, they don't say that. John McCain didn't say that --
Fair, John McCain didn't, but --
-- But the very highly respected governor -- by the way, the very highly respected governor of Iowa didn't say that.
Right, not a territory of the U.S.
-- This is different --
It is different than the John McCain situation, right?
Much different.
But --
Much different.
-- Let me play for you what Governor Kasich --
-- Excuse me, there is a group -- Erin, before you play it --
Yes?
Before you play it, there's a group of people that say you have to be born on the land. OK?
Yes, there are and that's what --
-- And, that's what that means --
-- some of those constitutional scholars are saying. Look, it's a fair point --
We're not going to -- we're not going to know until it's tested, but how can you have it tested if you're running for office?
What so you say to that, Mr. Trump? Right, I mean, I know you're saying you were asked a question --
I agree with it a hundred percent --
-- you didn't bring it up, but you've just brought it up again to me. You're bringing it up --
Erin, you'd be surprised.
OK.
I agree with it a hundred percent, but the Democrats don't. They're going to bring a lawsuit. They've already said they're going to bring a lawsuit. So, they're going to bring a lawsuit, and we'll have somebody potentially running for president who people don't even know if he's allowed for president? I don't like it as an issue. Again, this was brought to me as a question from The Washington Post. And, in an article from The Washington Post a number of top legal scholars have stated that he doesn't have the right to run. So, how can the Republicans put up a candidate that may not have the right to run? In other words, there's a questions as to whether or not he has the right to run. It's a big question.
You do -- you do like bringing it up though. I mean, I'll give you that other people are saying it's a serious issue, but you are shall I say, stirring the pot.
Excuse me, I don't bring it up. Who asked me the question? I didn't bring this up to you, you brought it up to me, Erin. I'm doing and interview -- I'm doing an interview with you by phone, and you're question was this. I didn't -- I didn't bring this up. I wouldn't have brought it up. You brought it up to me just now.
Well, I brought up was Ted Cruz nervous about Iowa, and then you brought this up.
Ted Cruz -- he's very nervous. I watch him, he's very nervous. He can't answer the question because there is no answer to the question because nobody knows. It's an unsettled matter. As Lawrence Tribe of Harvard would say, it's an unsettled matter, and as many other people would say -- some people go further than that. They say he doesn't have the right to run.
And, so, you think this is going to continue to be an issue, and a fair issue for her?
I hope not. I hope it's not going to be, but she's the one that started it. I hope it's not going to be. I'm not looking to make it that way. It's a little like Ted. I mean, people bring it up to me, I'm not bringing it up. But, you know, I hope it's not going to be an issue, but it may be. It depends.
All right. So, the $1.5 billion dollar jackpot, so, I guess, what's that get her, $900 million dollars? She's got to pay taxes, right? Does that change the game for Clinton? What do you say?
Well, I don't know what's going to happen with her. I've been watching her. But, I would give my money to the vets, and she would give hers to herself, and I think that maybe shows the difference between the two people.
People are extremely angry, but to be clear, when he says, "We need smart, well-educated white people who will assimilate to our culture, vote Trump", you're saying you disavow that. You do denounce that?
Well, you just heard me. I just said it. How many times do you want me to say it?
A third would be good.
I said I disavow.
All Right. Mr. Trump, thank you so much. I appreciate your time.
OK. Thank you very much.
How do you think it went tonight?
Well, I think great. Everyone said I won. Every online poll has me winning from Drudge to "TIME" to everybody. And so I'm very happy.
Do you see Ted Cruz as your biggest competition right now?
No, not really. I mean, we're going to see what happens. But certainly, I don't see him as my biggest competition. I see him as competition. Certainly he's competition, and others are competition. All smart people up there.
That is true, but now you talk about it at pretty much every stop.
Excuse me. You asked me. I didn't bring it up.
I've been to your rallies when you're talking about it.
Excuse me. I didn't bring it up. And I didn't bring it up over there either. Because it was brought up by, I guess, Neil.
How much so far, you think?
Probably 6, 8. Yes. We just bought about -- we just bought about $6 million worth of ads.
Your money?
All mine, 100 percent.
If you take it the whole way, you could have the potential to need to spend more than that. What's your ceiling?
I'll spend more than that. I have unlimited. I have a lot. I have unlimited. Thank you.
Well, that -- so that's your new campaign theme song, Born in the USA.
Yeah, yeah. It's a good song.
So -- so I guess it had to be shocking in the news that your mother was actually born in Scotland last night.
I'd learned for the first time that I wasn't a citizen. That wasn't very nice, was it, when you think of it.
So you and Ted Cruz went at it last night and there are different ways of looking at the results of this debate. A lot of people say nobody won, therefore you won. A lot of people said you won. There are a lot of people who are looking closely at Iowa who say Ted Cruz won. Are you concerned about Iowa?
I think we're doing great in Iowa. CNN has us up 33 to 20 in the last poll and I think we're doing great in Iowa. You know, I would love to win Iowa. We have a great relationship with the people of Iowa and I'd love to win it. I will tell you -- I know it would be nice to say hey, I just want to do well. I think we can win Iowa and we're going to try very hard.
Yes, and I think what a lot of people here in New York values, they don't think about hedge fund billionaires, they think about the men and women who ran into those buildings and the men and women who rebuilt those buildings. So I think...
You know, when you think about it, Willie, think about the firemen that were running up the stairs that came in from Queens and they're coming through the tunnel and they're going 100 miles an hour and they're coming in and they go up to try and save people and they know that building's got a big chance of coming down by that time.
Right. Yes.
... Wall Street Journal, and the headline was, "Trump Goes Way Up and Cruz Goes Way Down. So for him to lie about the polls...
So you wouldn't want him as your vice president?
I don't know. I just -- I don't even want to think about that yet. I want to win. I like to win first and then we can think about that later.
Welcome to politics.
It's called welcome to the world of politics. It's like how quickly we forget.
Well, we have this AP report about more talks about a brokered convention. So is that -- what is that like?
I don't see it. I mean, honestly? I don't see a broker -- they keep talking -- I think they talk because it's exciting, you know, having a brokered -- I don't think that's going to happen.
So let me ask you about Iran and about the capture of the 10 soldiers, the video that was released. Obviously a lot of that was...
Well, it's called humiliation is what it's called.
Isn't the fact that they are free and coming -- and coming home assigned, that that deal had an impact? Can you concede...
No.
Why?
Because they are smart people. The Persians are great negotiators. They wanted $150 billion.
I don't disagree.
How about them? You know, we've, like, totally forgotten about the minister, the reporter from the Washington Post. What about the four people that are there right now? Nobody ever mentions them.
So, I'm going to take it from another angle, because Mika and I obviously strongly disagree on this. And I think it's an absolute -- I think the deal was a disgrace. I think the president showed extraordinary weakness and I think what happened yesterday and what's happened over the past month shows the Iranians are just bad people. Their leaders are bad people. So my question is this: Why do you go along with that deal? Cause you've said...
Me?
You said if you were president...
The theme of my -- I talk about how incompetent this leadership is that we have.
It's already gone.
That's the problem.
... that you're -- well, you're...
All true, whether you like it or not.
Are you confident that the people in Iowa who stand in line, who show up 15,000 at a time to these events to support you and to see the Donald Trump show, are you confident that they'll go out on that Monday night and caucus for you?
Well, I am. I mean, look, they show up and I have the biggest crowds by far, far bigger than Bernie. And he's second by the way, I have to say, but far bigger than Bernie and it's hard to believe that somebody's going to be waiting for five hours in the snow and but they're not going to go for 20 minutes or 40 minutes to either caucus or vote.
That's what I was saying about my hometown yesterday when you were in Pensacola, Florida, and my brother, thrilled to...
Great guy, by the way.
Yes.
So that was packed. They sent away 7,000 people, you know, that couldn't get in. Pensacola was great. Those people are incredible. But all of the -- we were in Oklahoma, we were in Dallas, we filled up the Maverick's arena -- packed. I mean, it was packed.
Massachusetts.
Well, Mobile, Alabama, we had 35,000 people and there -- it's all the same. It's like a love fest. You know, the -- the theme, make America great again, that's what these people want. They want to see it. They don't want to see us being led around. The -- the Iran deal, that's just one of many, OK? But you look at the Iran deal and despite what Mika, who we all love, despite what she said, it was disgusting what they did putting guns to the heads of those young people.
Oh, stop.
That's right. Apologize. Apologize.
Do you -- do you have the organization?
... because what's going to happen is...
Don't you think he should live up to that?
I do. I do think so. Well, Mike was betting against me?
Oh, my God, Ann. Thank God for Ann.
People don't know how important she is, OK? We don't talk about her, right Mike?
She's incredible. I know.
She's an amazing woman.
You know what?
No, no, no, she's a highly respected woman.
You know what Mike says about Ann?
What?
The bet was that you're going to win the Republican nomination. I said it months ago. And we have a piece of paper. So, that's the contract, right?
I'm thinking it's a contract.
I'm thinking Navy or forest green.
So, that's good to know.
You're running for president. No more business.
I want a piece of it.
Which is still an A.
Oh, a minus? I heard he gave me an A.
So, voting is going to start in a little over two weeks here and then all across the country. They're going to come in quick succession. You've got a lot of support and your supporters are very loyal to you. But you've also got a lot of undecided voters in Iowa and around the country who haven't picked you yet. What do you say to those undecided voters now who haven't decided to vote for you?
Well, I think we're going to do very well here and I think we have -- I don't know about the undecided voters. We have a tremendous group of voters that are going to vote and you know, by a lot, by a long shot they're the most loyal. I have the most loyal people. We have people -- they say you can do anything and they're going to be with you. And I say I love my people. And I do love my people, but by far...
But you want more people.
No, no. Sure. But they're going to make decisions and I thought Cruz hurt himself last night very badly because he looked very strident to me. I see you gave him a B-plus, but I think you're wrong about that because I think people are not going to like him based on that performance last night.
What grade would you give him?
I can tell you one thing, if you live in New York, you're not going to like him. He gave up about 20 million votes last night.
You know, a lot of your constituency, if you believing what you read about the people who support you here in Iowa, New Hampshire, elsewhere, live now paycheck to paycheck.
True.
But Donald, you compared Bill Clinton to Bill Cosby in that Instagram ad you put out. Why is Bill Clinton's personal life a problem for Hillary Clinton in your eyes?
Well, you know, I don't want to really get -- I don't want to hurt anybody. I'm just saying he's got some difficulties. He's got some problems and if they want to play the dirty card, and you know, I don't think they will, but if they want to, they've got a lot of problems.
And it says something about her, you think?
Well, you know...
Or just about him?
... there were those that said she was an enabler, which is an interesting term. But let's see what happens. I don't really want to get into it too much. I want to win on -- on my own merit. We're going to put people back to work, we're going to bring spirit back to the country. You know, if you look at the Clintons and all that, there was a lot of bad karma going on during that period of time with the impeachment and the -- it was always problems, always difficulties. We want to get out of that.
But you're not answering the question...
No, I am answering it.
... about the concept of background checks.
I'm saying this -- and we don't have to take chunks out. And you already have background checks. You already have a lot of -- and you understand what I'm saying. You already have a lot of background checks right now. The government doesn't use them. The federal government doesn't use them.
What kind of...
And it is also one other thing. Big mental health problems.
I agree with that.
The guns don't pull the trigger; sick minds pull the trigger. But we have big mental health problems.
Would you want certain people who are in certain categories, who are on terror watch lists...
Well, I mean -- I -- but, Mika, you already have that. You know what? That's already covered.
Not really.
It is.
How?
But -- I mean, look, we want to protect the arts. It's all very important. But we also have to get debt down. We have to do a lot of things. So many things to do.
Now, Penn Station, built during the Depression.
There's 60 percent of our bridges are in trouble of maybe falling down.
So where are you...
But infrastructure is important, transportation, all of that: schools, bridges, tunnels, roads. You look at these roads, you look at some of these highways with the horrible medians. You know, the stuff that always warps?
Yes.
They put it up. Somebody is the greatest salesman in the country. The guy who makes that garbage, the metal? Did you ever see it looking good? I don't know what happens to it. They put it up, about two days later, it looks like -- and this guy, I want to find out who he is. He has to be so wealthy. It's such garbage. I think I'd ban if I were, you know. It is such garbage. OK.
Where in the list of your domestic priorities would be wiring this country up the way much of China is wired up, Wi-Fi?
Yes. Well, you have to. You have to -- well, not only wire...
Right.
And we obliterated the Iraqi military. Iran's got it, takes over.
They just walks in.
It's very subtle.
All right. Donald Trump, thank you so much.
Thank you.
So you're not a conservative?
No, I'm conservative, but when it comes to different elements of what I believe in, that's what people really understand. I'm going to solve our trade problem. I'm going to solve our military problem. I'm going to get rid of ISIS. I'm going to create borders. I'm going to do the things that this is what they want.
Like?
Well, I can say like any -- you know a judge who is a totally underrated and not spoken is Justice Thomas. I mean, if you look at -- if you look at some of the judges that we have like on the Supreme Court, Justice Roberts turned out to be a nightmare for conservatives. I mean...
I'm asking you. How are you going to make sure?
No, I'm asking you, why did he push so hard to have a judge who has absolutely set the conservative movement back and said everything...
When I interview him, I'll ask him. How you're going to make sure you don't get betrayed by your appointees.
I will study it carefully. I will work with people that I respect, conservative people, and we'll appoint judges that will be good. And I don't think I'll have any catastrophic appointment like Justice Roberts, which was really more than anybody else, pushed by Cruz and Bush.
But, you know, the person who sued him probably doesn't have standing. A lot of legal scholars...
It's all right. There will be a lot of people who sue him that do have standing.
You have standing. Why don't you file suit?
That's an interesting case, wow. That sounds like a very good case. I'd do the public a big favor.
You said you should put your money where your mouth is. If you really believe in this, you should file the suit.
Well, it's a good idea. Maybe I'll talk to them about that. I'd like to talk to Ted about that, let's see how he'd feel about that.
Well, you really...
You know, when I file suits, I file real suits, OK.
Let's talk about national security. Rubio versus Cruz on national security. Rubio says this USA Freedom Act, which Ted Cruz supported, could have been written by lobbyists for ISIS. Cruz says it's the best way to both protect national security and protect privacy. Who is right?
Well, let me just tell you something, I come very much down on security. You know, we have a whole thing now going on about whether or not we want to protect our freedoms and all -- I mean, to me, security is freedom. I am on the side of security. And I've been there from day one. If somebody is listening to my calls, I'm not going to like it, and maybe I'll sue, and I have a right to sue, but when it comes to me, personally, I would rather have that. I want security.
So, you're saying Rubio is right?
Well, I would go with the Rubio side, yeah.
It does sound like you're a little worried about Cruz now. You're coming down...
No, no, I come down on anybody that doesn't tell the truth. He didn't tell the truth during the debate. He didn't tell the truth about New York City. I mean, New York City is just -- very few places on Earth could have done and suffered the way they suffered. Remember this, George, that was the greatest attack in the history of our country, greater than Pearl Harbor, because Pearl Harbor they attacked the military. Here, they attacked civilians. And these two massive buildings came down on top of the rest of the city, thousands of people killed, and the day -- an hour later, we started the process. Great people started the process. People coming in and firemen coming in from Queens knowing they may die because they wanted to run up those buildings. They all died.
OK.
And we have this guy, who falsifies his personal financial forms. We have this guy, criticizing --
She went to your wedding.
OK?
So you'd welcome him in the race if you get the --
I would love to have him in the race. I mean, I think -- I don't think it's going to happen but I would love to have him in the race. It's very late for anybody to join the race right now. I mean, I know the filing requirements and for anybody to come in right now is very late.
All right.
Look what's happening with the stock market.
Always or just now?
I have a very great relationship with God and I have a very great relationship with evangelicals. And I think that's why I'm doing so well with Iowa.
The life you have now when you say that you try to do good, that sounds very different from decades of tabloid media coverage in New York in which some of your wilder escapades were --
No, I'm talking about -- I'm talking about over the last number of years.
OK.
You know -- I mean, I'm leading a very good life. I try to lead a good life and I have. And frankly the reason I'm doing so well in Iowa and leading the polls including the CNN poll, where I'm 33 to 20 in Iowa, that's -- and by the way, one of the things I didn't like, that Ted Cruz said -- he said, oh, he's doing so well in the polls -- not doing so well on the polls because nationally he's not doing well. New Hampshire he's doing very poorly.
Right.
... and about the dancing on the streets, which was a good story for me, in terms of making my point, he tried to take back that story. I said he was graveling. Graveling, you know what graveling means. OK?
If you could go back, you'd do it differently?
I will -- I would have not done it because it's confusing. Some people believe me when I said -- I mean, I swear to you, that's true. I had no idea.
OK.
Now I may have met the guy but I didn't -- how many reporters -- you've known me for a little while. How many reporters do I deal with? Hundreds of reporters a day.
... you acknowledge it looked specific. But I want to move on --
I'm just telling you, I was talking about a person graveling.
OK.
In this case, a reporter graveling and trying to take something back. That's what I meant by it. I swear to you, that's true.
OK.
He said I met him in the 1980s, that's ridiculous.
Let's talk about the financing of your campaign. You said that you will self finance your primary campaign. You are getting some donations, you're not particularly asking for any but you are getting some.
Let me say this, little donations...
Right.
... where people send them in, because honestly to send them back would be insulting to the people, and then for a small amount of money.
I get that.
And it doesn't amount to that much.
If you get the nomination, a general election campaign might require a billion dollars...
Yes.
Are you reluctant to spend a billion dollars of your own money?
Well, I have a lot more than a billion dollars if I want to do that. I don't know. I haven't made that decision yet.
Yes.
But I haven't made that determination. I will tell you this, people love the fact that I'm self-funding my campaign.
Do you think that Ted Cruz and all the other people you mentioned are more likely to do the bidding of their donors because they got money from them? I mean, is that the direct charge.
Yes, yes. Oh yes. Well I mean look, psychologically, yes. That is the way it is. Somebody gives them money, not anything wrong, just psychologically, when they go to that person, they're going to do it.
They owe them.
They owe them. And by the way, they may therefore vote negatively toward the country. That's not going to happen with me.
Right.
They're all dealing. Bush had an event where he had an event for his -- whatever and an event for his PAC. Right? For his campaign.
Right.
The ballrooms were right next to each other. And the events were simultaneous. OK. You tell me they're not dealing with each other? So I think PACs are very bad. I think they're very dangerous. And you have to come up. I do think there has to be transparency, but PACs are very bad.
He said he didn't know.
He didn't know -- well, he didn't know about his financial papers either. You know, how are you going to be president if you don't know about a million dollar loan from Goldman Sachs? And you said it's something you don't know about. Now he doesn't know that he was a Canadian citizen. I mean, that's in a way -- maybe worse than all of the other things we're talking about.
Do you think the same cloud hangs over Marco Rubio?
No, I don't think so. No, it's a different -- it's a very different thing.
Right.
Number two, I don't want to take a chance. OK? So we're starting -- as you noticed, we started an ad campaign.
TV ads, yes.
I think it's good. Let's see what happens. But -- so...
Mr. Trump, thanks so much for your time.
Thank you very much.
Appreciate it.
Thank you.
So, what do you think about this Iranian deal? We got our people back. They got $100 billion back and some people who were in big trouble.
Well, they are actually getting $150 billion, and we are getting four people back. They are getting seven plus. And I know you just mentioned it, the 14 Interpol bad ones, they're baddies...
But he could win the first two contests.
Well, he could win it, but I -- did you see the rest of the poll? The rest of the poll looks like it's pretty tough. But let's see what happens...
Right.
It's like, you know, you have these people are 1 or 2 percent that I don't know, why it would bother me? Who cares. But I watched last night, and they said, "Why is he even talking?" But he is always invoking my name. O'Malley -- he is always invoking...
In -- in a nice way.
Right.
Right, you are. We remember. All right.
You have all seen a lot of people attack me, and you see where they are right now. But he attacked me first.
Never a dull moment.
Thank you.
Yes. But we won that. You know, look, you know I have been in the forefront of that. I think we won that deal because we said to any major department store chain if you forbid your employees to say Merry Christmas we will tell everybody and they are not going to buy at your store.
But they don't do it, Bill. I mean they don't do it.
It's political correctness.
Bill, there is a problem they have with that. But they do have a problem with tax exempt status. I mean they are afraid to get too political because if they get political, they're going to have to all of a sudden -- they will lose that status and they don't want to do that.
You are talking about the churches fighting back. The churches though are free to say what they want to say.
I'm talking about for the church to fight back.
So you bribed them. As a businessman you bribed them.
It's not a bribe. It's just the fact that I get --
You bribe them.
-- well, in some cases some people do that. Bill --
All right. Do you want your money back?
I think it's important.
Do you want your money back?
If they want to send it back, I will take it gladly. I would love to have it back. By the way I wish it was put to good use. You want to know whether it's through that foundation or any other -- I wish it were put to good use.
I got it, I got it.
I get along with everybody. It's the job. But I think -- no, I think the public understands that and there has been no retribution.
Ok. We cleared up the Glenn Beck Obama vote thing last night. I don't know whether you saw it last night. It was pretty clear --
By the way I did. I did and I respect the fact that he was willing to do it so quickly.
Yes. He did the right thing and we are a fair program here and we correct the record.
He did the right thing. I respect that.
But I just want to go on the record did you vote for any Democrats in the last 30 years for president?
It's probable. I mean I would always vote for the best person.
Did you vote for Bill Clinton?
Don't forget -- no, I didn't.
So you didn't -- both times you didn't vote for Bill?
Wait a minute. In New York City, you practically couldn't vote for a Republican.
Oh, come on. I live in New York, you can vote for who you want. So you didn't vote for Bill Clinton, right? No Bill Clinton.
You mean when you have a vote of 98 percent to 2? You're going to waste -- a lot of people didn't even bother voting.
Did you vote for Bush twice? The younger twice?
I voted -- I did vote for Bush twice, yes. I mean, I don't think he did a particularly good job. I think he got us into Iraq which was a disaster. But I voted for Bush, yes.
I just want to get the record. Ok. And then you voted for McCain against Obama the first time.
I was on his committee. I raised a lot of money for McCain. I was on his committee.
All right. That doesn't mean you voted for him. I just want to get it on the record.
In all fairness to McCain, I don't think Abraham Lincoln could have won that election. But I voted for McCain.
Yes, but the problem with that is you gave it to the Clinton Foundation after you raised it. No, that's a joke.
No, I raised money for McCain. Wise guy.
All right. So if you lose by a little -- You're not going to like be mad and call all the Iowans pinheads and stuff.
No, I won't be mad. I will not be mad but I would love to win Iowa. I mean I really have a great relationship with the people of Iowa. And I think we are going to do very well here but who knows?
Did you watch the Democratic debate on Sunday night? Did you see that?
I did. It's actually the Democrat debate. Why do the networks call it the Democratic Party?
Because the Democratic Party is the traditional way to say it. I don't buy into that.
It sounds better but it really isn't the right way.
Who do you think is more qualified to be president? Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton?
I think it's very weak. Let's start off with the third guy. I mean he was the mayor of Baltimore, he's a total loser. He's got like one percent and he's a disaster. He shouldn't be up there.
Sanders -- if you had to vote for one. Sanders or Hillary?
Well, I wouldn't vote -- I think I would take a pass on that election to be honest.
You would stay home.
Hillary shouldn't be allowed to be in the election because of emails -- ok.
Hillary shouldn't be allowed?
And Sanders is a socialist --
All right. Ok. Anything else you want to say? I have got all my stuff down. You were very cogent tonight, very pithy tonight. You didn't go off on me. That's good.
No, no. You are a great guy.
Stop it. You are ruing my reputation.
I have a meeting. I know I will destroy your reputation but we have a meeting in a little while and another speech and I'm here today, I'm here tomorrow and we are having a great time in Iowa.
All right. I think Palin endorsed you. That means you are carrying Wasilla, Alaska.
She's a terrific person and she did --
Of course. And I'm a great guy -- you've lost all credibility by calling me a great guy. So it doesn't matter what you say now.
Maybe just a little.
But see -- but see, the question, would you consider it?
I haven't discussed it with her -- no, I haven't discussed anything with her about what she would do. But she is somebody I really like and I respect, and certainly she could play a position, if she wanted to.
Do you think that you would put her in your cabinet should you win?
Well, you know, it's interesting. Because she didn't even talk about it. You know a lot of people, they'll call, oh, gee, that's called politics. She never even mentioned it. It was just the endorsement. I don't even know that she'd want to do that, actually.
Well, you know why that is.
I mean, so what are you going to do? I have an idea.
Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, this is heather here.
Hello Heather. Hi, Heather.
Great to talk to you this morning.
Good.
In Iowa, but in New Hampshire...
Only in Iowa. We're pretty tight in Iowa. I'm winning in Iowa, but we're tight in Iowa.
Right.
But elsewhere, other than Iowa, if you go to New Hampshire and other places, he's not doing well at all.
But Governor Kasich...
But he's doing better in Iowa.
You know, Ted Cruz came out last night, of course he was criticizing you in part over the Sarah Palin endorsement. But one of the things he said, he criticized you for being a dealmaker which is really one of your positive points. He said...
Yes, that's a good thing, not a bad thing.
Yes, it is.
... and you know, when Al Sharpton -- when Al Sharpton's jumping up and down, you know, people say, well, give me a break.
... today and tomorrow.
She's -- she's going to be going and we're going to have a lot of fun. It'll be great.
All right. Congratulations.
Thank you all. Thank you very much.
Joining me now on the phone is Donald Trump. Hello, Mr. Trump.
How are you, Don?
Yes.
That's a pretty big lead. I'm very happy about it. That's a very respected poll and we, you know, I've done really well in New Hampshire. I love the people of New Hampshire. And we've done -- we've done really great there. So, I'm very honored by it.
Yes.
I mean, can you imagine spending $79 million and I spent almost nothing. Now I'm going to start spending money because I feel guilty. So, I'm going to start spending money and I don't want to take any chances either, by the way. But he spent $79 million and he's toward at the back of the pack. It's ridiculous.
Let's look now at the match-ups here, other polls up now. And it's a match-ups between Hillary Clinton and the other candidates, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. And again, this survey is of New Hampshire voters, Mr. Trump.
Right.
Yes.
So, I'm sure I'll be able to do very well against either one of them.
But let me ask you this.
... and the trade deals that is so horrible. We don't have to go in further destroy General Petraeus.
Yes. OK. Let's focus on Iowa right now. Because you know the big news is you and Sarah Palin. What was it like with Sarah Palin on the campaign trail for the first time today?
Well, it was terrific. You know, we had 15,000 people, we had to send away 5,000 people. You saw the arena today. I hope you saw the arena.
You said she wanted nothing. She spoke with my colleague, Jake Tapper in September and she said, you know, she's energy secretary or what have you. But there was no negotiating over, you know, if she would join your campaign. What might happen?
No. Zero. I mean, she will work with the campaign, probably. But, I mean, in terms of if I win will she want a job or what some kind of thing is zero. Absolutely, not discussed in. I mean, it's frankly, very impressive that she doesn't discussed it.
Well, let's...
Close to 100 pages. He had a very small financial disclosure. He had two banks maybe he's got more than that, I don't know.
Yes.
But, you know, he always goes on the side of the banks and we're going to protect the -- we're going to protect the people. He is always talking about the banks. Well, the people didn't know that he was borrowing from Goldman Sachs and from Citibank.
Well, he said if it needs to be he will fix it if it needs to be.
Well, sure.
OK. So, Christian first, American second and then he goes on conservative republican, in that order. Is that who -- that's who he says he is. So, who is Donald Trump? Would you put it in that order?
You know, at some point I think he should add his family. I mean, he forgot to add his family. I mean, does he have his family in that group?
Well, I'm going to mention that. I'm going to mention that.
Excuse me.
But there is a...
You can tell me about polls, I don't even know about that. That just came out I guess.
But there's another interesting result that goes along with what you're saying. A third of republican voters, a third of them are questioning Ted Cruz's eligibility for president.
I understand that.
By the Washington Post.
... three and a half weeks ago by the Washington Post, OK?
OK.
Because unless they clear it up, nobody knows if he has the legal standing to run for president.
So, you said this was a question from the Washington Post, but you have been and as you've said, you know, you care about him and that's why you don't want there to be any question about whether he is eligible to be president.
I don't care about him. I care about the country.
OK. All right. So, listen. I want to move -- let's move on and talk about you again.
OK.
You mentioned -- you mentioned Oklahoma and Sarah Palin that you said today she had a great reception. In Tulsa, this afternoon, she spoke about her son's...
Right.
Have them send it over. We'll take a look at it.
And you could be -- you can be the one. I've never done this. I mean, I did this just because I thought that the money was free. You know, the interest rates were so low. The money was free so the market had to go up because it was free money.
Yes.
Now all of a sudden we'll find out the money is not so free that some people are having a very, very hard -- many people are having a hard time getting it and the stock market is semi-crashing. Let's see what happens.
Should he step done, though? Should he step down?
I don't know the situation well enough. I think it's a very difficult situation. Certainly, it's leading to catastrophe. It's one of the really bad things that I've heard of.
What would you do about it now if you were the president?
I mean, there's more than just him. Yes, he is responsible. But, EPA is responsible. I believe that the council at the time and the mayor at the time is also responsible. There are a lot of people responsible for this. This is a horrible thing. It's incompetence, it's bad management and it is a really a very bad mark on government.
So, before we move on, I just want to -- what would you do right now if you were the president about the situation in Flint.
Well, all I can do is get the funds to clean it up and get it done and get it done quickly because you can't have people drinking this garbage.
Right.
And it should have not taken place.
OK.
A very simple thing. All you had to do is check the water and you could find out that -- it sounds like they didn't check the water until after the water was being pumped into people's homes.
Yes.
So, there is a lot of incompetence to go around here and it's a very sad circumstance. I hate seeing it.
Yes.
The biggest crowd in their history, Dr. Jerry Falwell is an incredible guy and he made the most beautiful introductory speech. And when I finished I got a standing ovation. You forgot to say those things.
You said them, so I didn't have to.
Now I said it.
And the year before.
But the head of -- the head of the Academy I believe is an African-American. Is that correct?
Yes. She's a woman of color.
Yes. I'm not very well -- I haven't been following it very closely. But I think it's a shame. I think it's a shame that this has to, you know, that it has to come to this, where there seems to be great animosity. And, you know, too bad. It shouldn't be -- it shouldn't come to this, I feel.
The countdown to Iowa is on. And new polls show that Donald Trump is surging.
We are going to win so much, we're going to have win after win after win!
The 2016 Republican presidential front-runner is here tonight with reaction.
You people are going to get sick and tired of winning!
I want to...
And he has some other problems, like he didn't disclose in his financial papers that he was borrowing money from Goldman Sachs and CitiBank because he wants to be the big, you know, wonderful guy that takes down the banks. But here he is with personal guarantees to CitiBank and Goldman Sachs. So, you know, I think it should have been disclosed.
Yes. And ISIS -- you would take their oil and bomb the living daylights out of them. Tell me...
I would bomb them, you better believe it!
Yes, well, I agree with that.
We're going to stop corporate inversion.
Let me -- let me ask you this...
And we have companies that are leaving -- and Sean, we have companies that are leaving the United States and moving to Ireland and Europe and Asia. I mean, they're leaving. Pfizer is moving to Ireland. We have major, wonderful companies...
Tax benefits.
... that, frankly, because the taxes are so high -- and because they can't bring their money back into our country, which is ridiculous -- even the Democrats -- you know, it's amazing. Democrats and Republicans agree the money should be allowed to come back in. Who wouldn't agree? They can't get along -- they can't make a deal!
Sad. You can't do it.
And then today -- and then today -- well, I don't know if you saw today...
John Kerry.
... Secretary Kerry -- he came out and he said, yes, we expect a certain amount of that money to be used for terror.
I have the cut.
Can you believe this?
I just cannot believe...
You know, Sean, can you imagine...
Unbelievable!
... be used for terror. If...
It's scary.
First of all, why did they give them the money? Second of all, Sean, why didn't they have clauses that it can't go to terror?
It is insane...
It's incredible.
If Congress comes to you...
I can't believe he's even an intelligent man.
All right, stay right there.
... and we can balance the budget very quickly.
You think in five years?
I think over a five-year period. And I don't know, maybe I could even surprise you.
All right. Well...
But I mean make the country better. I'm not saying -- I'm not saying skimp. I'm saying making the country better.
It's over.
... the whole ball game is over because nobody even ever anticipates winning New York because it has so many -- you know, it's so powerful in terms of the process that we're talking about. West Virginia, I heard it's like a lovefest...
For you.
... because they understand my feeling toward coal and everything else. But West Virginia, Virginia -- I think I'm going to win states that are not on the agenda for Republicans to win.
Yes!
And you know, your own FOX polls -- hey, Sean, your own FOX polls have her -- have her losing to me. But I really want to run against Hillary.
Yes. Go ahead.
I actually would love to run against her. And by the way, the last person she wants to run against is me. And you know that. And you got a glimpse of that last week. But the last person she wants to run against is me.
You know, I don't like sore losers in life. Lindsey Graham came out today and said, you know, the battle between you and Ted Cruz, it's like being poisoned or being shot. There's palpable...
Terrible. Terrible.
Yes.
In South Carolina, where I'm number one in South Carolina, I was at 38 and he was at 1. And then he goes out and endorses Bush, of all people, who doesn't have a chance. I mean...
All right, I have a last question.
... here's a guy who's afraid to use his last name...
We're running out of time.
Yes, I mean, it's just -- I think...
I don't want to waste it all on him.
I think you're right. It's sad. It's sad.
If Donald Trump...
You're right. We shouldn't waste it with him, either.
... commits to fighting a war, is it we go to win it or we don't go at all? Last question.
OK. We're going to have a strong military. We're going to only win our wars. I don't want to go into wars. I'm a very temperate guy, believe it or not. We're going to have a powerful military. We're not going to have to. But if we go into a war, we're going to go into the war to win it.
Joining me on the phone right now is Donald Trump. Mr. Trump -- welcome back to MEET THE PRESS.
Good morning. And I have to tell you, his ad is wrong because I never knocked down that house. I wanted to get the house to build a major building that would have employed tremendous numbers of people but when the woman didn't want to sell ultimately I just said forget about it. So he's got me bulldozing down a house, I never bulldozed it down. It's false advertising.
It sounded like -- you said the other you wouldn't vote for him if he's the nominee. Is that true?
I talked about the fact that I'm not sure that I can vote for him because as you know, he has a very major issue. In fact, Illinois now is looking at it very seriously. I don't even know if he's going to be OK to run in Illinois, in the state of Illinois. He was born in Canada, he was born on Canadian soil, he was a citizen of Canada --
Can you sign a pledge?
Chuck, Chuck --
But you'll release it. You are going to release it?
I hate the way our politicians spend our money. I hate the way they give it away to everybody but us. We have to rebuild our country.
But you will release it?
And I say it and a reporter said that's the most refreshing answer I've ever heard on taxes. Because everyone tries to build it up, like Mitt Romney, he built it up, tries to build up how much he pays. It doesn't work that way. We're working on it right now and at the appropriate time you'll be very satisfied.
And finally I have to ask you about Bloomberg. What do you make of the idea that if you're the nominee, if Sanders is the nominee, that's what would inspire Mr. Bloomberg to go third party.
Well, Michael has been a friend of mine over the years. I don't know if we're friends anymore frankly. But Michael has been a friend of mind. I would love to have Michael Bloomberg run. I would love that competition. I think I'd do very well against it. I would love to see Michael Bloomberg run.
All right, you embrace its. Mr. Trump, I'll leave it there. Stay safe on the trail. We'll see you next week in Iowa.
All right -- thank you very much.
So...
It's got to -- whether he gets it done, whether he gets a declaratory judgment from the courts or does something, he's got to straighten that problem out, because there's a big fat question mark.
All right, well, thanks very much, Mr. Trump.
But that's not supporting somebody. I mean, that's rooting somebody on. I have to live with him. I have many, many buildings in New York. I have a big business in New York. I wish he were good, but he's not.
All right. Thank you very much, Mr. Trump. We look forward to seeing you...
Thank you very much. Thank you, John.
Are journalists treating you with new respect, because they think you may win?
Not all, but they're treating me with great respect, a lot of them. The Wall Street Journal has changed their views, and I have gained respect. Some of the other have changed their views, and rightfully so. I am not saying it from smile standpoint, but we've done a good job. Time Magazine wrote one of the most beautiful cover stories I have ever had, the one from last week, where I am talking to a crowd, but they're talking about this whole campaign. So, yeah, I think there's been a big change in mode and mood.
Yet, after Sarah Palin endorsed you, this cover -- I am with stupid, your reaction?
Well, I think that Sarah is smart, and she's cunning, and she's a good person.
What about the media attacks?
Well, they can attack. In the meantime, she has one of the best records -- Ted Cruz wanted her so badly, he almost cried. He's a nervous wreck.
As we get closer to Iowa and New Hampshire, you really ratcheted it up against Cruz. I know you say he started it, but he hasn't used that language.
He started it, and it sort of started during the debate. I said, whoa, whoa, what do we have here? He's a good debater, but not a good talker. If he's one on one with a person, he can't relate, he can't talk. That's not what we need. He was born in Canada. He was a citizen of Canada until 15 months ago, a lot of people say, and legal scholars have come out -- I am not only talking about the wonderful professor from Harvard, I am talking about other lawyers have come out very strongly and said he cannot run. So there's a big doubt over his whole candidacy and of course, he didn't file his loans.
He says that's a paperwork error. You said for days that you were only raising Cruz's issue of birthplace, because the Washington Post asked you. That was true. Other journalists asked you that were true, but come on, you know how to deflect a question. You were trying to make a major issue out of it.
The Washington Post asked me that question among others. I haven't given it very much thought, to be honest. I said there is a problem, because there is a substantial doubt. A lot of people think there's not a doubt.
You started out saying you were trying to help Cruz on this issue...
In a way, I am helping him, but you know who I really am helping, the Republican Party. He's already got two lawsuits that just got filed. The first thing the Democrats will sue him and sue the party, because he's not allowed to run, ok? How can you have a candidate that has a cloud -- sort of in real estate they call it a cloud of title. He's got a cloud of title. He has a cloud over his head. He probably or possibly is not allowed to run.
Many lawyers would disagree.
Some lawyers dispute it.
But you're the one who made an issue out of it, not the press.
It hasn't been decided. It depends on the court. That's a big problem. Do you agree that that's a problem?
It's a potential problem. It doesn't seem to be a problem until you brought it up.
How can you have a person running for your party that maybe isn't allowed to do run for the party?
Let's talk about New York values. You're from Queens, I am from Brooklyn, and you effectively brought up the response to 9/11 when Cruz raised this in debate. He was making the point that when you did an interview in 1999, you said I am a New Yorker and very pro-choice. I am a New Yorker and...
I hate the whole concept of abortion. I said that strongly. I hate the concept of abortion. I am pro-choice, but that was a long time ago. I will say this. Ronald Reagan was a pretty liberal Democrat when he was younger, ok, and he switched over to a fairly conservative -- he was pretty good, and he turned out to be a great President. People change. People change, but if you remember that comment, it says and very strongly, and I give them credit for leaving that part in, I hate the concept of abortion. I said that very strongly.
But on this point, Senator Cruz says you're not becoming the establishment candidate, that the establishment is embracing you, because you may deals that he won't.
The problem with Cruz is everybody hates him. Think of it. You have all these Republican senators. He doesn't have one Republican senator that's endorsing him, and then you have Senator Dole...
He's a maverick.
Bob Dole is a great person, with an incredible wife. He came out so strongly against Cruz and he was very nice to me, which I really appreciate, but these are great people. They aren't bad people. These are great people. You have to get along a bit. You can be tough, you can be sharp -- I am a deal maker.
You don't take that as an insult?
No, I think that's a great thing. You know I am really going to do? You look at China, you look at Japan, you look at Mexico, they are killing us. A guy like Ted is not a deal maker.
As you know, Mark Levine, he questioned whether your -- Rush Limbaugh was critical, and I know you care about what they think. Last time we talked, you said that influenced you to back away from some earlier criticism of Cruz.
Rush has not said that. He made a point, but he said you've got to do what you've got to do. I like Mark very much, but I think Mark is really much for Ted. That's ok. I have a lot of respect for Mark Levine, but I think he's been for Ted. That's why we have menus in restaurants, you make different choices, right? But I would like to have Mark on my side, but I guess he didn't like this, but if you remember, Ted Cruz started it.
It's a campaign.
It's ok, but I have to hit back. If you look like Lindsey Graham and Perry, Graham hits me all the time and then he supports Jeb Bush, who has no chance. Less chance than you and you're not running.
If you're the nominee will you tone down your rhetoric a bit? Will you reach out to minorities more?
Absolutely. I think I'm going to do great with the African-American -- if you look at minorities, the African-American poll came out, I was at 25 percent. I am going to do great with the African-Americans. I think I'm going to do great with the Hispanics. I think I'm going to do great with the Asians.
Do you mean absolutely are going to take different approaches?
I don't know if you want to change so much. The African-Americans love me. Look at what happened as an example with African-American youth, 54 percent, 58 percent, they don't even no it's so high. They can't get jobs. Look at African-American people in their prime, 30s, 40s and 50s, they want jobs. They're going to like me better than Obama. The truth is Obama has done nothing for them.
Did you just say African-Americans will like you better than the first African-American President?
I think relatively speaking -- he does have a slight advantage. I think relatively speaking when I'm finished, I think they will absolutely love Donald Trump. I am going to create wealth for the country. People will partake. We're going to take jobs from China, Japan, all these countries, and African Americans will benefit these are great people. They want jobs.
If you are the nominee, will you continue to do so many interviews.
I think I am not going to change too much. I have to do the fair shows, but you have always treated me very fairly. I will do the shows. The last month of the campaign, President Obama was all over the place. I would call up Romney's people and would say why isn't he campaigning? That was a big mistake, no, I am not disappearing.
Mr. Trump, thanks very much for joining us.
Thank you.
All of a sudden in Iowa, you've got double-digit leads according to the CNN most recent poll. Is this now a two-man race?
I don't know that it is. I doubt it is. You know, you never know what's going to happen. I'm working very hard in Iowa. That's the one where somebody is closest to me, but I took a pretty big lead over the weekend if you saw the polls that came out, including yours. We've taken big leads everywhere. I mean, nationally big leads. In New Hampshire very, very big. In South Carolina, amazing. So Iowa is very important to me.
What do you have that Ted Cruz doesn't have?
Well, look, I don't want to knock anybody, but he's got a lot of problems. He's got a problem with his Canadian birth. He was born in Canada. It's a real question. As you know, Lawrence Stride from Harvard, and many lawyers other are saying, he can't do what he's doing. He's not allowed to run. And you have some lawyers that say definitively he cannot run.
He did disclose it to one entity of the federal government, but not to another.
He didn't put it in his personal disclosure form, OK, financial disclosure form. And You've got to do it. You've got to do it. He's got two banks. But he didn't do it for a reason. He didn't do it because he doesn't want people to see that he's borrowing from banks that he's supposed to be regulating.
The establishment Republican candidates -- they're basically four, Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, John Kasich -- who do you see as your biggest threat?
I don't really view anybody. I just want to do my own thing, Wolf. I could say this one, that one, what difference does it make? I just want to do my own thing. We're really resonating -- we're doing great with evangelicals in Iowa, as an example. Nationwide I'm leading with evangelicals by a lot. And we're doing fantastically with the Tea Party. They're terrific people. We're doing great with the Tea Party. We're doing great with everything. I mean, I'm leading every national poll by a lot, and now I'm leading every single state. And in most cases, by a lot.
You have very loyal supporters.
I do.
In fact I think you were joking, but you said -- it's getting a lot of buzz -- you said you could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, that wouldn't affect the support you're getting from your supporters.
Well, you don't think I was joking, you know I was joking -- of course I was joking. The whole room was laughing, and I was laughing when I said it.
Because it got -- you know, you got some criticism.
Well, no, from dishonest press. They said, oh, he said something. When they show me, I'm laughing, they're laughing. Everybody is laughing. Everybody is having a good time. Of course I'm joking. I mean, you know that.
Of course.
But -- and the purpose of that is to say the people love me. They want to stay with me, they're loyal. They're tired of seeing our country being pushed around and led by people that are stupid people. They're tired of it, Wolf. I mean, we're tired of the Iran deals. We're tired of the Sergeant Bergdahl deals, where we get a traitor and get they get give of their killers that they've wanted for years. They're tired of dealing like this. We're just -- we can't take it anymore. And people are looking at it, and they're looking at me, and they have confidence in me. You know, I've built a great, great company and I'm going to use that talent now to do it for the United States.
Another New Yorker who's built a great company is Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City. He's now toying with the idea as running as a third party independent. If he were to do so, could you beat him?
I'd beat him, and I would love him to do it actually. I love the competition. I love the competition. I would love for Michael to do it. We used to be friends. I guess we're not friends anymore, I don't think we are. But we used to be friends, good friends. When I had a problem, he had a big problem in the Bronx, I cleared up the problem. There was a big project that was -- they were unable to get it built. It was under construction for like 25 years. Way, way over budget. I took it over. I got it knocked out in one year, and now it's a tremendous success. Michael asked me if I'd get involved in it, and I'm the one that got it done and did a great job.
Well, it could be competitive.
I hope he's going to do it. I mean, I hope -- I don't know that he is.
There's a lot of murmuring that he might do it.
But I hope he's going to do it.
You've listed your net worth as about $10 billion. Forbes says, we just checked it, $36.5 billion for Michael Bloomberg.
Yes, I don't believe that. I don't believe that.
You don't think he's worth that?
It's a technology company. I mean, if somebody came in, frankly, and comes up with a better machine than him, people stop using his machine.
If he says he's ready to spend a billion dollars of his own money to be elected president, are you ready to match him dollar for dollar, if you're the Republican nominee?
I don't know. I don't think he's going to do that. I don't think he's going to run actually. But I may be wrong. But I don't think he's going to run.
When you say probably, you haven't 100 percent decided you will be at the debate?
No. Nothing is 100 percent.
What would you do?
We gave them $150 billion.
How did that go?
I did two nights, actually.
President George W. Bush, he was in office in 2007, when you said...
Right, absolutely. I'm so fan. I have never been a fan of Bush.
But who is more responsible for the weakening of America internationally? Would it be President Bush or President Obama, because you have been very critical of both?
I think Bush did a bad job, and I think Obama carried it out. He continued to do a bad job.
If you were elected president, would you move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem?
I would. I would, yes.
Did you see Tina Fey reprising Sarah Palin, "Saturday Night Live"?
I did. I did. I did. It was very cute.
And Darrell Hammond plays you. What do you think of him?
Well, I think Darrell is great.
He does a pretty good job.
He does a great job.
It's very funny, you got to admit.
He's very good.
One final question. A lot of buzz that you slept in a Holiday Inn Express the other day.
I did.
How did that go?
I did two nights, actually.
Mr. Trump, thanks very much for joining us.
Thank you very much. Thank you, Wolf.
You said it jokingly, I get that; but, I mean, such a sensitive moment in time, in terms of mass shootings being up, crime up in 30 cities, in the double digits. Was it inappropriate at this moment in time?
No, it was said as a joke. It was fun. We were all having fun. It's, like, we have to lighten up a little bit. Every once in a while I like to be politically incorrect. There's nothing wrong with that.
Let me turn to national security, obviously one of those major issues for the American people today. You said in the past, look, let China deal with North Korea. You've said in the past, look, let Russia deal with ISIS.
No, not let them, I want them to. China has ripped off the United States for years. They've taken our jobs. They've taken our money. They've taken our manufacturing. They have total control over North Korea. They say they don't; they do. They say that; they're toying with us. They love this. They love it. They have total control. North Korea couldn't exist, food, everything, it comes through China. Now, let China -- when I say, "let China", I'm telling the China, sorry folks -
Do it.
-- you deal with this madman because I don't want to do it. If we have to do something, we have to do something; but China has to deal with North Korea.
Well you've also talked about tariffs in this regard. So we talk about whether it's 45-percent tariff or lower on Chinese goods coming in the country. What about the --
They aren't on our -- just so you understand, we lost last year, in terms of a trade deficit, $500 billion-dollars with China. That's not a partner. That's not a partner. We discussed that at the debate, where you did very nicely by the way.
Thank you.
Your whole group was fantastic. But we lose a fortune with China on trade. At some point, we have changed that.
OK, but that makes all of the Chinese goods coming in here more expensive. You know the price for those goods are very cheap --
No, no. You know what it makes it?
Much more expensive.
You're wrong. It makes it, we will start making the goods here. OK? We'll start making the goods here. When it becomes prohibitively expensive, our companies are going to make them in Iowa and they're going to make them in North Carolina and South Carolina and New Hampshire. That's what's going to happen.
Well, Putin is --
I don't know whether it's been determined --
OK, report say that Putin --
Yes, I don't think -- has Putin said -- have they found him --
You don't think you've alienated people, I mean, come on, you don't think --
No --
When he was mayor.
So, he should love me -- when he was mayor. So, he should love me.
Because there was just too much power --
No --
Because you didn't think the third term was effective --
No. Things happened in the third term, which were not good for him. He should not have run for that third term including the famous snowstorm which was a catastrophe. I mean, So, I'm not knocking. I like him. He could be a friend of mine, I'm not sure, I've haven't spoken to him for a long time. I think he probably isn't, if you want to know the truth, he should be. We used to be actually quite good, but the very good. But obviously, if he wants to run because I'm in, maybe, he doesn't like me as much I would have thought of that time. I would love to beat Michael.
So, you will be there Thursday?
Excuse me?
So, we should assume you will be there Thursday night?
She's not very good at what she does. I will tell you that.
We should assume you will be there Thursday night?
Well, you can probably make that assumption, but I'm thinking about it.
Would President Trump ban partial-birth abortion?
I am pro-choice in every respect.
But -- but wait a second, what...
I mean, I saw him -- hey, George, I saw him the other day. He's so nervous. He's such a mess. His polls have gone down, like I have never seen polls gotten down. People realize he probably can't even run for president, he was born in Canada. And now all of these constitutional...
But let me -- let me just stop you there, though.
... where is it coming out...
Mr. Trump, thanks for your time this morning.
Thank you very much.
And joining us now, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Donald, good to have you back on the show. How are you doing?
Good morning. I am doing fine.
Why is that, Donald? Because you're not a dyed in the wool evangelical? Why are you doing well?
I'm a religious person. I have been going to Sunday school for a long time, like you did, Joe. You know, I am a religious person. And frankly, you know, I am a believer. And they understand that. You know, some of the polls came out. It was interesting. CNN said I would be the best leader, the best with ISIS, best on the border by far, I'll be best on a lot of other things. The evangelicals want that. They want that, too. They want a combination of things, but they want that very badly. So I am not surprised that I'm doing so well with evangelicals. I know nationwide I'm way up with evangelicals. So that's very good.
Why is Ted Cruz's numbers slipping? Is it because of your charge that he is from Canada and may not be able to be president if he is elected?
Well, he does have a problem there. No question about it. Nobody knows if he can even run. He has to solve that problem. Get a declaratory judgment from the courts. He could be running and end up being thrown out of the race in the middle of it.
Now, do you really believe that, Donald?
And the Democrats -- You know the Democrats will sue the first day. If he got the nomination, there would be a lawsuit day one which will take years to resolve. I think there is a big problem.
Would President Trump ban partial birth abortion?
Well, look. I am pro-choice in every respect.
And what does Trump think about Iowa?
How stupid are the people of Iowa?
Donald, what's your reaction to that ad, particularly the first part that you're a flip-flopper?
Well, it's another -- I'll give you an example. First of all, I am pro-life and everyone understands that. I'm pro-life. But going into a second thing about how stupid are the people of Iowa. Then I said, how stupid are the people of the United States. And I was talking about because everybody in this country was believing -- I'm not going to mention his name -- but it was a certain candidate --
Ben Carson.
-- who is no longer doing too well.
Did you just make a parallel between Ted Cruz and President Obama?
Well, they're the same. I think actually Ted is more strident than Obama, if you want to know the truth. Nobody gets along with Ted. At least some people like Obama. Nobody likes Ted. I don't find anybody that likes him. You talk to senators, I talk to senators that frankly want to come out and endorse me. It's amazing what's happened over the last two weeks. I told this to Joe, Mika. Over the last two weeks, so many people are calling and saying, you know, we want to get involved with you. We want to endorse you. We have a very big endorsement coming down today. A very powerful endorsement --
Who is that?
What?
Who is it going to be?
You'll find out a little bit later. But we have a very powerful endorsement coming down today. But so many people want to endorse us because they say Ted Cruz is -- he's wacky. Something missing there. I don't know. There is something wrong. You know, it's wonderful to be a rebel, but you've got to get some people on your side a little bit. Here is a guy with all of the Republican senators sitting out there. He deals with them every day when he's there. He deals with them every day. And he doesn't have one senator supporting him, not one Republican senator supporting him. That's pretty sad.
And we have, speaking of John Heilemann, we have John with us and he has a question for you. John.
Hi, John.
Hey, Donald.
Do you notice I took you out of that group -- Hey, John, I took you out of that group and Mark. You know.
I appreciate that. Although I will stand up for my colleagues at Bloomberg. We always treat you fairly. Tough, but fair is the way that Bloomberg Politics always treats you in every instance, Mr. Trump.
OK. Well you're wrong on that. But you and Mark are fine.
Let me ask --
You and Mark are fine.
I want to underline this point. This is an important point to make. I know you have a follow up, Mika. So Donald, you got into the construction business, what, in '73?
Yeah. About '77, yes.
'77. Who was the mayor in '77?
Beam.
So it was Beam. Then who was the next mayor you dealt with?
Was it Dinkins?
Dinkins was next.
I even had a piece of Lindsey, if you can believe it. It's a long time.
And you had Lindsey. Then you dealt with Giuliani and then you dealt with Bloomberg.
Right.
And Koch, who is in there. You dealt with Koch.
Right. I dealt with Koch on the Wollman skating rink and many other things.
Wollman skating rink. And then you dealt with Bill de Blasio.
Right.
So you have everybody from Lindsey. You've dealt with -- And I'm just underling this point because we were like Donald doesn't know politic blah, blah, blah. And I'm not carrying your water here. I'm just surprised this hasn't been reported. You have become a billionaire many times over in one of the toughest cities to deal with politicians. The corruption, the mob, every law -- every regulation of every stripe. Taxes. People don't like working in the city. You've worked with everybody from Lindsey to Beam to Koch, Dinkin, to Giuliani to Bloomberg to de Blasio and you figured out how to work with all of them get richer in every administration.
Well, you know, it's nice that you say that, Joe, but very true. I got along with Lindsey --
No, it's -- I 'm not being nice. It's the truth.
I got along with Beam, I got along great with David Dinkins. He was a very nice man. You know, I got my big job approved with David Dinkins. Now who would think -- you know, the big one on the West Side, which is almost 6,000 units along the Hudson River and everyone said you'll never get that approved. You'll never be able to do it. I had tens of thousands of people protesting when I proposed the job because I was going to block everybody's views because it's a massive job. Everybody said you'll never get it approved. In fact, I got the land inexpensively because they said it was impossible to get it zoned. I got it zoned. Not only got it zoned, got is zoned for much more than anyone thought possible.
Donald, do you have a TV? Are you watching us right now?
Yes, I am. I always watch you. Only because of you.
Very good. All right. Donald Trump, thank you so much for being with us, as always. Great talking to you.
Thank you very much. Thank you, Joe. Thank you, Mika.
Yeah.
You know, two weeks ago he came out and he came a long way because he didn't want to lose the vote. But everybody in Iowa understands that that's phony business.
Mr. Trump, we'll see you Thursday night, right?
We'll be talking. Let's see. I don't like the -- frankly, I didn't like the press releases that Fox put out. It's like they're playing games, and I don't like...
Well, we'll...
... I don't like it when people play games with me...
... we'll all be there.
... and they're playing games.
Thanks. Thanks, Mr. Trump.
All right. Thank you very much. Thank you.
All right, well, wait, wait, wait...
...the debate. In fact, everybody said -- well, everybody said, I won all six debates and especially the last one. So, I don't mind debating. In fact, I actually like debating.
Listen, Donald, I got it, I got it.
...it was like done by children. And, well, I think it was inappropriate.
Right.
I didn't cancel it.
Right.
I'm not canceling it...
No, and we respect you for that.
Frankly, you're a lot tougher than Megyn Kelly in my opinion...
That's right.
...unfair was the question that Megyn Kelly asked me in the last debate.
Well, I don't think so.
And everybody said I won that debate and I gave a great answer. I mean, believe it or not...
All right, well, wait, wait, wait...
...I think I gave a great answer. And everybody...
I got it, I got it.
And that's a good thing. It's a good thing.
But look, Donald, you can do that any night and I can help you when -- we'll raise five times as much money. I got a really good idea that I want you to be involved with about raising money, but we'll get to that later.
Well, I will do other debates, Bill.
Look, here's where you're making a mistake though. You're making a big mistake.
You know, can I just say about one thing? Could I just say one thing?
What? Sure.
We have had six debates so far. Every online...
What you said something about Carly Fiorina. You opened the door for it. And you explained what you meant about Ms. Fiorina.
Excuse me, Bill. You would not have asked that question that way and, by the way, I love...
Not that way, but I would ask.
...and that's why I'm doing your show tonight, Bill. I'm only doing it because I agreed to do it last week otherwise I wouldn't have even done it. But I made a commitment to do your show last week...
But, Donald, look, you have to understand, number one, Kelly's question was within journalistic bounds. All right. Number two...
I disagree.
OK. And that's good. That's good. You made your case. You won the debate. That's what America is about. Robust debate.
OK, that's fine.
Don't walk away from it, all right.
Let's talk about something more important. Bill, let's talk about something more important. This is not that important. Let's talk about something more important.
You went to church last week. You don't usually go. And you went to church in Iowa.
I do go. I go a lot. What do you mean I don't usually go? I go to church a lot, but not every Sunday.
No, no, no. You are taken as a Christian, the eye for the eye rule goes out. Here's what it is. Turning the other cheek.
Bill, let me tell you, you're taking this much more seriously than I am. I'm not taking this seriously. I'm going to have a wonderful time tomorrow night at 9:00 at Drake University.
But you're depriving the people of seeing you in a forum they need to see you in.
No. We have a lot of press will be there and everybody. We're going to help a lot of veterans whereas Fox is not giving anything to the veterans. I'm giving 100 percent to the veterans.
Oh, stop.
I'm going to make a substantial donation.
And then, look, Fox News has allowed me to raise more than $20 million for veterans who need the track chairs so don't give me that. Now, I'm going to hold you over against your will. All right. All right.
That's OK.
Well, some people did.
I built a great company...
Some people didn't like you.
...best-selling books. I had...
I understand.
...one of the top television shows in television. Nobody...
But you were rundown as a showman...
It's not a very -- Bill, it's not a very nice way of expressing. No, they thought I wouldn't run and then they thought...
Right.
...and if I did run, I'd just have a good time for a little while and then I get out. Unfortunately...
OK, but now...
...by many, many points.
But you can be sidetrack sometimes, and I'm not talking about you, Donald Trump, but any human being can. And not see...
I agree.
...what the real important thing is because -- look, Putin is going to come at you. The mullahs are going to come at you.
It's all right. That's OK.
And the bigger picture is, get your message to the folks.
There's got to be something because you set the all-time record in cable history and so did CNN and...
So they want just to know you.
...so there's got to be something going on, Bill.
They want to know you.
No, that's fine.
But by walking away from this debate, you're not giving them...
I'm not walking away. I was pushed away. I'm not walking away, Bill.
You're walking away. Would you do me a favor? Look...
Bill, I'm not...
...because I bought you so many vanilla milk shakes -- I bought you so many vanilla milk shakes, you owe me.
That's true.
You're actually telling the truth there.
...we had an agreement. You actually...
You're actually telling the truth that I said...
...because I told you upfront, I said don't ask me that question because it's an embarrassing question to you and I don't want to embarrass you.
If you don't want to, it's up to you. And I'll give you a compliment. I don't know any politician under these circumstances that would have come on in here and done what you did tonight. I just don't know any.
And by the way, this is much tougher than the debate. Bill, this is much tougher being with you, because frankly, you're smarter. This is much tougher than doing the debate with Megyn Kelly, believe me.
Well, that's why you should do it and have fun tomorrow night. And tell the folks...
I'm going to have fun, 9:00, Drake University. 9:00, Drake University, we're going to raise money a lot of money for the veterans. Watch.
All right, you owe me 17 milk shakes then, and I want them.
That's OK. I'll do that. Thank you, Bill.
With you not there at the FOX debate last night, your main rival in Iowa, Ted Cruz, listen. He was getting pummeled from left and right. Was this maybe by design? Did you think about this all along?
Well, a lot of things have happened since then, you know, because you saw the result. And he did, he got very badly hurt. And he's going down. Ted Cruz is going down. Plus there is the Canada problem. He has got a huge problem. That problem with Canada. So whether or not he can even run. I think he cannot run. So we will wait to see what happens.
It wasn't by design?
You know, I would like to tell you it was by design. Maybe it was by instinct, OK. That it wasn't good night for him and it wasn't good for a couple of the other folks. It was not good at all. In the meantime, I had my forum and I had tremendous numbers of veterans and we raised $6 million and it was a good night for us.
Would you say, though, in any way that FOX News did win? A, Megyn Kelly still was the moderator and, B, they did not give you the $5 million you ask for for charity?
Well, I never asked that Megyn be taken off, number one. And I don't care about Megyn Kelly. I couldn't care less. I don't think she's very good at what she does, but I couldn't care less. But I never asked for that. I wanted $5 million for the vets. The vets have been mistreated. The networks have plenty of money. FOX has plenty of money. I said $5 million for the vets. And when they didn't do it, I went out and raised $6 million for the vets. So the vets did even better.
But here in New Hampshire, there's another Republican debate right here in eight days. Are you going to be going to that debate?
I think I will be. I look forward to the debates. As you know and as everybody has been saying, I won every single debate. Every online poll has me winning the debates. I actually like doing the debates. You I have never done it before in all fairness. But I do like during the debates. And I will be here. I love this place. I have special friends. I'm doing really well here. The polls just came out. I'm doing really well here. So I will be in New Hampshire doing the debates.
Do you feel like you were mocked at all the beginning of the debate last night by Ted Cruz and some of your other rivals?
No, I didn't even watch the whole debate. I'm going to watch it later. But, no, not at all. I think Ted look great. Look it was great for me. It was great for the vets that I didn't do it because we end up getting more money than FOX would have paid.
Finally, there's a guy here, a tattoo artist here. He's given away free tattoos for people that want your logo or your photo on their body. And his business is good from what I hear?
So he is a Trump fan? He's -- maybe I'll have to have a tattoo for the first time in my life. Maybe not, though.
Thank you, Mr. Trump.
I appreciate it. Thank you.
Putting aside the fact that you are upset at this point with Fox News, we are right now just a few days away from the caucuses.
Right.
There are a lot of Iowa Republicans who are undecided. Do they deserve to hear you on the debate stage tonight answering tough questions?
Well, I think they will hear me because I'm going to be up there for an hour, an hour and a half had a bigger event and we're going to have more people than they have.
But you have an issue with certainly one of the moderators of the debate. How was it me different?
Well, I'm not a person that respects Megyn Kelly very much. I think she's highly overrated, but other than that, I don't care. In fact, when Fox called me, because they very much want me there, they called me just now, they called me just before you walk into the plane and they called me and in all fairness very nicely but they want me there very badly and I never once asked that she be removed. I don't care about her being removed. What I didn't like is their public relations statement where they were sort of taunting and I didn't think it was appropriate, I didn't think it was nice.
Don't you sometimes put out press releases that are -- I mean they're somewhat similar in tone to the one that you object to from Fox News.
I can understand that, but, you know, from me just listening, I didn't think it was appropriate right before the debate.
They've up -- on the phone, apologized. Is that what's...
Yes.
... phonecall was that...
It's -- Facts that you might have been nicer.
You got an apology?
Yes, and they could not have been nicer.
Who apologized to you?
I don't want to say.
OK. So, when it comes to Megyn Kelly and you have had this piece, you raised the idea of the word bimbo. You said you didn't want to use it, you said it was not politically correct...
I didn't use it.
... but you used it. You said the word and then you've retweeted.
No. No. I said I wouldn't want to use it because it's not politically correct.
Ted Cruz...
Right.
... has been -- he not just Ted Cruz, but also those who support him have been hammering you when it comes to your previous use on late term abortion.
While I'm hammering him on his views in where he was born.
But they -- They have been...
... and he's weak -- by the way, he's very weak on illegal immigration.
But you said, you said to my colleague, just recently down the bash, you said I don't want to talk about that when you were asked about your previous support for late term abortion. What this...
You know, because everybody now, especially this falls, I am pro-life, everybody knows I am pro-life, he knows I'm pro-life. You know, Ted Cruz also took a commercial -- wait a minute. Ted Cruz took a commercial but I ripped down an old lady's house. He said ripped down, they have the bulldozers, they say he destroyed an -- because of eminent domain which by the way is very important because you wouldn't have roads, you wouldn't have schools, you wouldn't have...
But can you explain this? You said...
Wait a minute, wait a minute. The house was never ripped down. I never ripped down the house. She didn't want to do it, ultimately I said let's not do it.
But let me ask you this question.
But no, wait, wait, wait, wait. Why did we mention...
This is my question now.
Brianna, wait, Brianna. He did a big commercial. He said I ripped down a person's house.
When you said that, when you said that, certainly not...
But he will never apologize.
I've heard -- Well, you joked about you said you could shoot people and you wouldn't lose supporters and I've heard some people say it's kind of maybe taking supporters for granted. Are you taking your supporters for granted?
Not at all. And frankly, that was done obviously in a very joking manner, and a lot of people loved, in fact, I was smiling, they were smiling, everybody was smiling and the truth is your report, your own polling said that by far trump has supporters that will never leave him. I was up to 69% and then it on got into the 90s. But I have great support earth. I have just amazing people. I am in love with the people. I cherish these people. They are really great. And, I'm very proud of that. I mean to me -- to me, that makes me very proud that I have people that are so strong in favor of me. By the way, far stronger than any other candidate by a long shot.
Before I do leave, I want to ask you more about this event tonight. Who is going to be with you on stage? If you're going to be talking specifically about the veterans groups that you plan on donating money too?
Well, it's a tremendous evening, it's become a tremendous evening which is really one of the reasons I just can't go to the debate now even if I wanted to. But...
Mr. Trump, thank you so much...
Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
I know who he is.
We are very firm on illegal immigration. But we have had tremendous endorsements, Chris, and, you know, the relationship with the people of Iowa has been fantastic.
Do you think it's morally wrong, morally wrong for someone to be elected president who comes from some other country?
Well, what are you getting at?
I am talking about --
Are you talking about Ted Cruz?
Yes.
Are you talking about Ted Cruz?
Right.
But in this case, he was born in Canada. I think it is a big problem.
Let us talk about a high level here, about you being president of the United States. The leader of our country -- and take the seat that Lincoln held and others have held. When you think about Mount Rushmore -- and I am dead serious about this -- I have been there, I have been overwhelmed by the place. I sat there for two hours one time just staring at these four presidents.
I agree.
What did she do wrong with Whitewater? I do not remember --
Chris, one thing you will say, too, most of the lawyers --
OK, let us --
-- the lawyers do say it's criminal though, Chris. I will say that.
Well, I want to ask you a big question about --
Go ahead.
Yes, one last question, and this is about you.
Go ahead.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I don't -- I --
-- anyways.
But -- but just to button this up very quickly, sir, are you saying that if you become president, you might try to appoint justices to overrule the decision on same-sex marriage?
I would strongly consider that, yes.
Question, are you sure, Mr. Trump, you don't want her to wait until Super Tuesday, on March 1st, where there are a couple of states that have even more delegates?
Well, you know, I -- I was kidding. In fact, that was at the event where we raised all the money for the veterans. And to be honest with you, I was kidding. But, I wouldn't mind. Look, Iowa would be a great place for her to have a baby and, frankly, so would New Hampshire and so would South Carolina. We have about three weeks to worry about it, but they'd all be great places for her to have her baby. She's a great person and hopefully it's going to be a healthy baby. That's the most important thing.
But -- but...
-- this is why he doesn't have...
Any senators in...
-- it's disgusting.
-- any senators endorsed you yet?
They will be very soon. You watch.
You say that...
Many, many more are coming.
Well...
-- for the first time in many, many years.
Anything...
-- because...
-- anything...
-- they know of -- they know that this phony -- these phony ads these people put out there, such lies, like Obamacare. Nobody is more negative on Obamacare than Donald Trump.
What about this charge, though -- it is a press release? Like, if you can't...
That's OK. That's OK. No.
Weeks ago, it was tighter in Iowa. Now you are ahead by a little more. Why do you think that is?
Well, I think that Ted Cruz has been severely affected by the Goldman Sachs loans, which he didn't disclose. And it was on his personal financial form, and the Citibank loans he didn't disclose.
But he would say that is great, because, as you have said...
That is bad. No, no, it's bad.
But those are not senators. Those are outside- Washington types.
No, no, but, still, they are very important people and very important -- as an example, Sheriff Joe, Arizona.
Joe Arpaio.
Toughest guy. He endorsed Trump. You know what that means? I am toughest on the border.
But humility, a lot of people don't think -- your name is on everything. You have often talked about sometimes braggadocio is part of your pitch.
No, I know, but there is more humility than you would think, believe me.
Hidden humility.
We are all the same. We're all going to the same place, probably one of two places, you know, but we are all the same. And I do have actually much more humility than a lot of people would think.
But you don't want to show it?
I would rather not play my cards. I want to be unpredictable.
All right, Mr. Trump, thanks so much.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Let's bring in right now Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. Donald, have you seen thesemailers by these other candidates? And did you guys mailed out anything that scores voters with Fs or Xes them out or anything like that?
No, we're doing it the honest way, Joe. We've decided we should do it the honest way. I haven't seen the Rubio one, but the Cruz one is unbelievable. It looks like -- I saw actually an actual copy and it looks right out of municipal government. And it says, you know, violation and it's absolutely amazing. I've never seen anything like. It's a total fraud. Now I don't know if they're going to do -- he's being investigated over it, but it's a total fraud. It's a disgrace that they can do it.
Let's ask you about your Iowa campaign. A lot of talk about possibility of a second place finish. Some are even saying that you could finish in third yet the polls are showing you still -- gold standard polls showing you still ahead by five. What are your internal polls showing? Or what are you feeling on the ground?
Well, we're feeling really good. We have a lot of people, we have great support, we hope to do well. You know, I don't know. I can't tell you what's going to happen because it's an election, and the only poll that matters is the poll that's going to start in a little while and it's going to be very interesting. Here we are after a long period of time. The day has finally arrived where we begin this really incredible process. So I look forward to it. It's going to be very interesting. I just don't know what to tell you. You had the poll came out yesterday and it says we're No. 1 and that's good. I think I'm No. 1 in every single state, and it's -- and we're No. 1 in every national poll, too.
So when you really think of it, when it comes down tonight, you have absolutely no control over what happens. How does that feel?
Well, I'm going to be attending the caucus and, you know, maybe I'll do a couple of them, actually, if I can. But I'm going to be there tonight and I'll do the best I can to persuade people. But it will be a very interesting evening. I've never caucused before and it's a different way of doing things. And, you know, Iowa is a tremendous place. It's got a great sort of history behind it for doing this and there's tremendous spirit. The people are great. So we'll see what happens tonight.
Hey, Donald, it's Willie, good to talk to you on this caucus morning.
Hello, Willie.
Yes, Mike Barnicle.
You know, we have the biggest crowds. We have actually much bigger crowds than Bernie but he is second, I will say, because it is amazing what he's done also. But he also gets very good crowds. But it's been amazing.
All right.
But I'll be heading out to New Hampshire where the people have been equally incredible and where the poll numbers are even better.
Let's turn back to the Republicans. We are going to be talking to a number of candidates throughout the morning. But first up, Republican frontrunner, Donald Trump. He's on the phone with us this morning. Mister Trump, good morning.
Good morning.
So this is the day we find out do Donald Trump supporters actually turn up and vote. You're not one to be modest. Are you predicting a win tonight?
No, I can't do that. I mean, we've had the biggest crowds, bigger than anybody, bigger than Bernie. Bernie is second, I will say that. But the crowds have been incredible. I just don't know. I can't tell you that. I think so. The -- the enthusiasm, Savannah, is incredible. And it looks like we're going to miss the snowstorm which is good news, but that's going to come later. But I will tell you, it's been -- it's been an amazing journey and there's a lot of love in those rooms, so I would think that they would show up to vote. I hope so.
Mister Trump, there's been a lot of headlines over the last several months here in Iowa about you and Ted Cruz. And yet, in the last couple of days you're starting to hear more and more about Marco Rubio. His campaign is saying he's got Marcomentum and seems to be surging. Do you consider him to be a big threat to you here tonight?
Well, everybody's a threat, Matt. I think everybody in the race is a threat. You never know what's going to happen. It's politics. And certainly he's a capable guy and he's in there running and he's pitching. And, you know, we'll have to see what happens. He came in third in the poll, the latest poll, the last poll, and we'll have to see what happens after tonight. Probably by ten o'clock tonight we'll know the -- we'll know the results.
Well, right here, right now, Cruz seems to be your toughest competition. You have really laid the hammer down on him and he has dropped in the polls but he's still in there. You're still neck and neck. Why has he been so hard for you to shake?
Well, I think that, you know, he's a professional politician. He's a talented guy. And, you know, we're all talented people. I mean, we went there pitching, I said he was born in Canada, which is true, and a lot of people have a question as to whether or not he's actually able to even serve as President. And that's come out -- come out loud and strong. And I -- I tell you, some constitutional lawyers just over the weekend have come down with results that he's not allowed to be President. And that's a big -- that's a big cloud over his head. And I said he should try and remove that cloud by asking for declaratory judgment to the courts. But you have numerous lawyers, including Laurence Tribe of Harvard who doesn't go that far. He said it is untested law however. But numerous lawyers have come out saying that he's not allowed to run. He's not allowed to serve as President. That's a -- that's a tough thing. And I think that's affected him quite a bit by a lot of people, frankly.
Donald, you -- you've based a large part of your campaign on being a winner, a successful guy who knows how to close the deal. If you don't win tonight in Iowa, how much does it damage your political brand?
Well, I'd like to win. I'm doing incredibly well with the evangelicals. As you know that you probably saw those numbers and they are- -- have shot up through the sky and nationwide leading with evangelicals. And Jerry Falwell, Jr. came in yesterday and the day before and -- and endorsed me, as you know, and it was amazing. We had an amazing two days together. And, Sarah Palin, who's going to be on your show later, she's a terrific person, a terrific woman and she's going to be -- and she endorsed me, as you know. And Sheriff Joe endorsed me. And Willie Robertson endorsed me. I mean, I'm getting endorsements from everybody. And I will tell you, so many people are going to be announcing endorsements over the next short period of time because they see what's happening. It's a movement. People want to really take our country back. They want to -- you know, they want to -- look, my theme is make America great again, and that's what they want to do, Matt. They want to make America great again and that's what we're going to do. We're not going to make deals like the Iran deal, such a foolish deal that could have been so much better. If it was made at all, frankly, could have been so much better, and so many other deals. And -- and trade with China, China is just eating our lunch.
Right.
Japan is eating our lunch. I mean, all of them. And we want to -- you know, we want to bring it back. We want to take our country back.
Well, Donald Trump, this is your first election day, so we'll be watching it with you, of course. Thank you for your time this morning, sir. We appreciate it.
Thank you very much. Appreciate it
Did you get that?
Yes.
Sorry.
Yes, I hear you fine.
And you'll be facing the voters for the first time tonight. We're going to be talking to your sons in the next half hour. Thanks for joining us this morning. We'll be talking to you later as well.
Thank you very much.
And you said that at your press conference tonight. And we're not relitigating the FOX issue, but everything now is good with FOX from your end. I heard you the other night say so. So you're moving forward...
That's true.
You know, when you got into this race, I remember interviewing you and you were very clear -- and I even went back and looked up -- that you're fed up with career politicians. They talk and talk, make promise after promise...
Right.
... and that...
All talk no action, right.
I know you got to go. Will you improve your ground game? Some people thought there could be improvement there. We have about 30 seconds.
Well, we didn't spend much money on the ground game, and I would agree, we didn't have much of a ground game because I didn't think I was going to be winning, and you know, etcetera, etcetera. That's why I'm so honored to have come in second. Most people said I wouldn't be in the top 10 originally, when I started in Iowa. And yes, in retrospect, we could have done much better with the ground game, yes.
All right, Mr. Trump, always a pleasure. Thank you so much for taking time, and we'll see you in New Hampshire this week later, hopefully. Thank you for being with us.
Thank you. Thank you very much, Sean.
It's 31 past the hour. Joining us now, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. It's his first interview since the Iowa caucus. Donald, good morning.
Good morning.
How's it going?
It's going good. It's going really good.
OK, so let's talk about Iowa. What happened?
OK.
Can you hear us?
I can hear you fine, Joe.
Donald, good morning, good to talk to you.
Hi, Willie.
Right.
So finishing second and getting them $6 million was OK for me. But I might have been hurt by the debates, by not being at the debates.
Mr. Trump, it's Katty Kay here. I just want to ask you about a tweet that you wrote. "I don't believe I've been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign, the only one. I will keep doing it, but not worth it." What do you mean by not worth it?
So Katty, I've turned down tens of millions of dollars of friends of mine that want to give -- just like I raised the money for the vets. I got Carl Icahn for a half a million dollars. I got Phil Ruffin for a million dollars. I got Ike Perlmutter for a million dollars. You know, I got these people giving millions of dollars, so I would be the greatest fund raiser in the history of politics if I was let loose. I said that I was going to self-fund my campaign. In other words, I was going to put up my money. So I don't think I get any credit for it.
But you think it's not worth it?
What's that?
You it's not worth self-funding your campaign?
No, no, I'm just saying with the voters, I'm talking about. I don't think that I get credit for doing -- I think it is a -- look, I don't mind taking in $200 million, $300 million. You know, Bush took in $128 million, all right? That's peanuts compared to what I'd raise. I'd get guys to put up so much money, $10 million easy a shot. I would have that number beaten by five times if I wanted.
So, so, Donald --
And here's the thing. I didn't think I get any credit for self-funding my campaign. In other words, the voters aren't going into the booth saying oh, Trump is self-funding his campaign, that's a big factor, and therefore I'm going to vote for him. And yet it's a very -- I mean, you're the talking about a lot of money. You're talking about potentially hundreds of millions of dollars.
So, are you, Donald, are you going to change --
I don't think I get the credit that it's worth.
So are you going to change possibly and possibly start taking money in the future?
No, no. I said I'm not -- no, I said I wasn't going to change. But I just don't think it's fair because I'm the only one that's self-funding. Everyone else is, you know, taking in money from the lobbyist and special interests.
Do you trust polls -- do you trust polls less? Or do you just do -- I mean, we all put it down to how weird the caucuses are. Are you still going to be trusting polls as much as before? Or do you think Iowa's sort of a one-off?
Well, I think it is. I think that polls for a caucus don't work very well. The polls for a caucus, it's too complex, the system is too complex.
Yes.
Sometimes I wonder how that can work where they take 300 people and they do a poll of the United States and it comes out pretty accurately. The good ones come out pretty accurately. Hard to believe.
Donald Trump, thank you very much, we'll see you in New Hampshire.
Thank you very much.
Take care.
Goodbye.
Donald, nice to see you.
Hi, Greta.
Donald, I want to ask you about the election, of course. But first, I want your thoughts on President Obama went to a mosque today in Baltimore to talk about religious tolerance and contributions Muslims have made in the United States. Your thoughts about that?
I don't have much thought. I think that we can go to lots of places. Right now, I don't know if he -- maybe he feels comfortable that we have a lot of problems in this country, Greta. There are a lot of places he can go and he chose a mosque. I saw that just a little while ago. And so, that's his decision. That's fine.
So, are you saying that -- I mean, OK. Is it dirty or is it a mistake? I mean, did he mistakenly because there was some report that it was a mistake that the campaign had tweeted that out or said that about Ben Carson.
He didn't make a mistake. Come on, Greta.
All right. Donald, thank you for joining us. We will be watching Tuesday night. Right now, you're up 24 points in the latest poll. So, I don't know, we will be watching this one.
Well, thank you very much. It's going to be very exciting.
Pleased to again begin the program with the very best interview in America, Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, welcome back to the Hugh Hewitt Show.
Hello, Hugh. You know, I just read the best article about you in USA Today. Wow, what power.
I know, that was a nice piece. I appreciate that.
Very impressive. I was very impressed, so congratulations.
Thank you. Yesterday, though, you compared the American media to New York real estate developers. If you prick us, do we not bleed? Really, we're that bad?
Well, some of them are. I mean, some of them are. It's not bad. You know, some are not very honest. And I understand it, but you know, I don't think I'd be that way, I don't think. Who knows what happens, but I will say this. 25% are really good, and 10-15% are terrific people are very, very talented people. But there's tremendous dishonesty in the media, especially in the political media. It's incredible.
I just, I remember your UN remodel testimony, what you said about New York developers.
Right.
And so, that...
Well, you know, I was willing to do the United Nations remodel for $500 million dollars, and they ended up spending $4 billion dollars. And I said I'll guarantee completion. They said well, but what will be the difference? I said my $500 million dollar job will be much better than your $4 billion dollar job, which by the way, was $2 billion. I said it will be $4 billion, and that's pretty much what happened.
Oh, that's what, your testimony was right on. I just, but you were so harsh on developers. I hope I'm in your 15% when it comes to the media.
Well, you're an honest guy.
Right.
I know you are.
You and I agree you are going to win New Hampshire on Tuesday. Who is going to be second and third, Donald Trump?
Well, I don't even know that I'm going to win. Who knows? I mean, I certainly, I'm up here now. I'm actually, we made five stops, and I'm right here, we're going to our sixth. And I don't know. I mean, I will say this. There's a lot of love in those rooms. We, the relationships that I have, and I've been here a lot over the years, you know, not even to do with politics. I've always loved New Hampshire. And there's a lot of good feelings. I don't know about second place. I see it's very competitive. Boy, there's a lot of fighting. I've never seen anything like it there. They're really going at each other, Hugh. It's pretty wild.
Well, so I am very confident you are going to win, but you don't have an intuition on who's getting silver and bronze?
No, I don't like to say. I mean, I have my feelings, but I don't like to say. I know, you know, we're doing well, and I know that there's a great feeling, and a lot of people are liking what I'm talking about on the border and on trade and on the military and knocking the hell out of ISIS, and you know, on so many different things, and taking care of our vets, which is a very important thing to me. Another important thing, because you know, to me, it's imperative we have to terminate Obamacare. We have to repeal it, and we have to replace it with something so good, and there's so many options that we have. You know, we'll do a great job. And there's a great feeling up here, but you know, I don't want to be so presumptuous as to say I'm going to win, because who really knows?
Oh, I do. I was right last week, so I'm saying I'm right this week.
OK.
But can we rule out Ted Cruz as your vice presidential pick?
Well, I don't know. Look, I have nothing against him. It was sort of a sad thing that happened, but I've always liked him. I've always gotten along well with him. But you know, I'm so much now focused on New Hampshire, it's sort of like I think in a way, you know, other people said I did great, because I've never done this before. I've never been a politician, and I picked it up nicely. I came in second, I beat governors and senators, and all of these people that are actually hot governors and hot senators, right?
Yes.
Successful.
Yes.
And you know, I come in a strong second. Actually, you know, you win by more than 2,000 votes, that's actually not a close thing. I did find it amusing where people say Marco, who I like, but Marco is unbelievable, he came in third, he came in third, unbelievable, and I come in second, and nobody said that. It's sort of interesting, but...
All right, now let me, I've got one more question about vice presidents. I had Joe Scarborough on the show last week, and I think Joe would make a great running mate for you. Have you thought about that?
Well, Joe is a great guy, and I will tell you, I know he loves that concept of running for office. And I haven't thought of it, actually, in terms of Joe, but I will say he's a very talented guy and I love his show.
He'd bring Florida with you, he'd bring a lot of media exposure.
Well, I think I'm going to do really well in Florida. You know, one of the things that is interesting, to me, I mean, you look at Florida, I'm at 48, and Rubio is at 11, and Bush is like at almost nothing. Bush is so low, it's amazing. It's amazing that he spent so much money and he's got such bad results. It's actually amazing. But you know, it's one of those things. But you know, I think I'll bring potentially New York, I think I'll bring Pennsylvania, I think I'll bring Virginia and Michigan and Ohio. I think I'll bring places and states that no Republican can talk about bringing, Hugh. And you know, as an example, if I won New York, because upstate New York, the numbers are through the roof. And if I won New York, the election's over, because you know, it's got so many delegates. And nobody else can even talk in terms of winning New York, so it's sort of interesting.
Let's talk about Florida for a second, because you obviously have big investments down there, and there's a state of emergency. The Zika virus has shown up there. You probably wouldn't let Ivanka, she's pregnant, you probably wouldn't let her go into the state right now. What would you do if you were president about this virus?
Well, you've got to do everything you can. You know, they have the vaccines that they're trying to come up with quickly, but they're not able to come up with. And it's mostly affecting pregnant women, which is, you know, which is a very rough thing. What you have to do is you have to dust it off, you know, they call it dust off, which is basically spray. But I don't see, you're not seeing these trucks spraying, and it looks like a very small part of our atmosphere that they're spraying. I don't see that as being very effective. I suspect it's something that you just have to be very careful with. And it's true. If you're a pregnant woman, you have to stay out of areas. I had not heard about Florida. Did this just come up, Hugh?
Yeah, that's today. The governor declared a state of emergency in four counties. I don't know if Mar-A-Lago is one of them, but I just saw the headline.
All right. Well, I hope that it's not going to be very big in Florida. That would be very sad, actually, very bad.
Now let me talk to you about a couple of issues, judges. I know your sister, Margaret Trump Barry was a very well respected...
Well, Maryanne. Maryanne. Maryanne.
Yeah, Maryanne.
Yeah.
Very, very well-respected judge.
Right.
She's senior status now. Who's going to advise Donald Trump on judges, because there will be three of them who are 80 or older if you become the president.
Yeah.
... on the day you're sworn in.
Well, it wouldn't be my sister. We do have different views a little bit, but it wouldn't be my sister. She's a very, very highly-respected judge, by the way.
Yes, she is.
... as you know. She's on the court of appeals, and highly, highly respected. But I think it would be a conflict to be dealing with my sister in that capacity, actually, because of the fact that she's my sister and she's on the court. She doesn't even like getting publicity. And you know, frankly, they did a great story on her recently, and she didn't want it. She wouldn't be interviewed for it. But she's very talented, she was always a great student and very smart, but no, I wouldn't be, I think it would be a conflict.
So who would give you advice on judges? I'm available.
Well you know, a lot of people, a lot of people, but you know, I, you know, know a lot about that world, the judging world. As an example, Justice Roberts, everybody liked Justice Roberts, turned out to be a disaster because of Obamacare. He could have killed it twice, and he turned out to be a total disaster, so...
I have to speak up for the Chief. I like the Chief, but it's not a debate, it's an interview. Let me ask you, then, about...
Well, by the way, I probably would like him also, but he did have a chance to kill Obamacare, and he had two chances, and people were shocked at what he did.
Let me ask you about the dope law in Colorado. I spent a few weeks in Colorado, a couple of months in Colorado in the fall, and there's dope everywhere. Chris Christie and Marco Rubio say they will apply the federal law and shut it down. If you're the president, Donald Trump, what will you do about dope in Colorado?
Well, there are a lot of bad things happening in Colorado with people's health. And if you look at the results, you know, they're getting some pretty bad results. Plus, it's being taken all over the place. I mean, I would have to look at it very seriously. Now I think if you talk about medical, you're talking about a different ball of wax. But there are a lot of bad results happening in Colorado, and people are talking about it. I'm reading about it. So I would be looking at a couple of different things, but I really would want to study it further, because they're doing a lot of studies. But you know, some bad medical reports and some bad, bad things are happening with what's going on in Colorado.
Good, I agree with you 100%. Now let me talk to you about a unique problem to you. You've got one of the biggest brands in the world. It's like, you know, Oscar de la Renta...
Right.
... or Gucci or, you know, Ralph Lauren. Most presidents put their assets in a blind trust so they don't know if they're helping or hurting themselves. How in the world does Trump put Trump in a blind trust?
Well, it's a big company. I've built a great company. You saw how well I did in my filing. Remember when I filed, they all said wow, people were shocked at how big I've made it, and low debt, great cash flow, and a great brand. And you know, I have somebody that actually like you and your show, Ivanka, but I have Ivanka, and I have Don and Eric, and I have great executives, and I would put it in a blind trust. Honestly, Hugh, this is so big, if you win the president, there's such an unbelievable opportunity that's so much bigger than even the biggest company, that who even wants to think about a company? You know, this country needs help. We have $19 trillion in debt, we have nothing but problems. We have ISIS, and we have bad borders, and everything's wrong. Health care, Obamacare is a disaster, and I would absolutely put, I wouldn't care about it. I mean, you know, it's a great company, it's a company that can run very easily, and my kids plus executives would run it. I would have no interest. My total interest would be on making our country rich and strong, getting rid of debt, and doing the kind of things that you want to see.
Well, you bummed me out a little bit, because everywhere I go, Ivanka is the most popular person in this campaign.
Yes, that's right.
I thought you should bring her to the White House with you.
Well, you know, she's actually, that would be a good idea. She's actually eight and a half months pregnant. So who knows what's going to happen? And you know, she's coming up to New Hampshire tomorrow, and she's a great person. She's really a very smart, young lady, but she's a great person.
All your kids have turned out to be great campaigners.
They are.
But let me go abroad. Angela Merkel, all of a sudden, Germans don't want her. She's blown it. She's in deep, deep trouble. What do you think of her? What do you think of her policy vis-a-vis the immigrants?
I think she's terrible. I think what she's done to Germany is a disgrace, and I've talked to you about this before. I think what she's done is an absolute, it's a catastrophe. She's going to destroy Germany. And I, you know, everybody thought she was a great leader. I don't know if she got carried away with herself. She's putting people in the country. They have no idea where these people are coming from, and there's tremendous crime. And you see what's going on, rapes and crime and problems that Germany didn't have.
No assimilation, and that brings me to the President's speech...
And that's the word. And by the way, Hugh, that's the word. There's no assimilation. They don't want, half of them want Sharia law, which is a disaster. They want women to be treated terribly. They want, you know, the whole thing is ridiculous. I mean, they, there's not going to be assimilation, and Germany and Sweden and every other country where this is happening, it's a disaster.
Well, that's why I liked when the President went to the mosque yesterday. He talked about American Muslims. He saluted the Muslims who serve in the military. I liked the speech. Some people didn't like the speech. But I thought he was stressing assimilation for citizens. Isn't that what we have to stress?
Well, assimilation is OK, but they have to assimilate. You know, if they're going to want Sharia law, which many of them do, and if they want to live under their own banners but on our soil, or in the case of Germany, on German soil, then the whole thing is ridiculous. It's never going to work.
No, it won't. It won't.
And I thought it was a surprising thing that he went to a mosque, actually. I mean, he could also go to a church, by the way, and he could also go to a synagogue. But he chose a mosque. And I thought it was surprising in light of what's going on today.
And also, a foreign policy question, Israel and Palestine have been fighting for as long as Israel has been a state, since 1948. Do you think a two state solution is viable, Donald Trump?
I think it's very, I think the whole thing is very, very tough. The level of animosity, the level of hatred and distrust is so, so tough. I've been with the greatest experts on the subject, and they think the coming together, you know, and wouldn't it be wonderful if it would work. It's a little bit like we're talking about in Germany where you know, assimilation. It's a very, very difficult situation. I always say you know, when we talk about difficult deals, I always say that may be the most difficult deal in the world to put together. The relationship is just so bad. And it's ingrained. I mean, it's ingrained for years and years and years, and the relationship, Hugh, is so bad. I use that as an example. If somebody could put that together, if somebody could create real peace over there, that would be, that would be the great dealmaker of all time. But it's going to be very tough.
Who's giving you advice on the Middle East? Who's your go-to guy or gal on the Middle East?
Well, I have numerous people. I don't want to give all names, but we have Walid, we have, you know, I have many, many people that I'm talking to, plus I read a lot, Hugh. I watch a lot and a I read a lot.
I know you watch everything. I don't think you ever miss anything I say about...
No, but I do watch. I watch a lot, you know, late in the evenings. I have a wonderful thing called Tivo and/or its equivalent. It's great. But I do watch, and I do read a lot. And you know, like I get the whole Middle East. The Middle East is a disaster. Don't forget, I said don't, as a businessman, I wasn't a politician, I said do not go into Iraq. You're going to destabilize the Middle East, and Iran is going to take over everything, and that's what happened, coupled with ISIS, because of the horrible policies of the leaders of Iraq, if you want to call them leaders. It was a disaster. But because of the horrible policies, this subgroup for them, and it's called ISIS, and ISIS has turned out to be a total disaster. So you know, I was the one that in '03 and '04, right at the beginning, said you're going to destabilize the Middle East. And that was, you know, turned out to be a pretty good prediction.
All right, let me turn to the general election. If you're the nominee, you'll be up against Hillary Clinton. First of all, there's a new show on TV tonight about O.J. He was guilty, but he walked away. Madoff was guilty, he went to jail. Do you think Hillary Clinton is guilty of breaking the law? And is she going to get away with it?
I think she's guilty. And you know, that's based on, you know, a little legal work that I've done and I have great lawyers surrounding me all the time for lots of other reasons where, you know, just deals and business. They tell me, and also reading and watching, they tell me absolutely guilty. I have a feeling that she's going to be protected by the Democrats, and I think it's very unfair to General Petraeus and to lots of other people that have suffered greatly doing far less than she has. And if you see the way that she's reacting to the President, where everything he says is great, she doesn't really feel that way, like on Keystone Pipeline all of a sudden, she changed her vote to, you know, her voice, to what he wanted. I think it's, absolutely, I think she's guilty. I think they're going to protect her, and I think that's going to be a very, very bad thing for our country. It's going to set up an almost a double set of laws, very, very unfair, and very unfair to the people that have suffered.
They've always had two sets of rules for the Clintons, though, haven't they, Donald Trump?
Well, Whitewater was a disaster, and everybody said that she was totally guilty of that. I was with a friend of mine that was very involved in that, and said it really was something that she should have paid a bigger price for. You know, she got away with it by a whisker. You know, that was by a whisker. That was almost a flip of a coin like she won the six flips. We have to find out that coin.
I know. I want that coin for the Browns.
Somehow, it doesn't...
I want that coin...
Yeah, it doesn't sound like the American way, I have to tell you.
All right, now Bob Woodward was on MSNBC this morning, and he said about Hillary, "I think a lot of it with Hillary Clinton has to do with her style and delivery, oddly enough. She shouts, " he added, "something unrelaxed about the way she is communicating." And everybody came down on Woodward like a pile of bricks calling him a sexist. How do you think she speaks? And is it because she's a woman that she sounds so bad?
Well, I didn't, you know, I notice that over the last couple of weeks, she has been shouting very much. I think he's really somewhat right. I mean, it looks uncomfortable, and a lot of people would say the woman, you know, I think that she has been, you know, very, she has been raising her voice a lot. I think it's painful. I think it's painful. I think it's going to be painful for her. It does look like she's really, really shouting, so I would have to agree with Bob Woodward on that. I think it's uncomfortable, and I don't think that's necessarily pleasant to watch. I would think it's very hard for her to do.
All right, now...
So you know, it may not be politically correct, but everybody knows it's the fact. And it seems to be that way more over the last week and a half, two weeks, that I've ever seen it.
She's rattled, but Ted Cruz earlier today said you're very rattled. What do you think of that?
No, I'm doing well. I'm a very solid person, and you know, Ted, you know, where that whole thing is with, everybody agrees the most solid person. You know, you can't build a great, great company by you know, being even a little bit rattled. Rattled has not been my thing. I've been a winner all my life, and frankly, I think we're going to see a good result up in New Hampshire, and we'll see. But one thing I've handled all my life, you have to be able to handle pressure, and I love pressure. I've always liked it better than even without pressure. And I think you know, you've seen it. Don't forget, I've never done it before. I've been a politician for seven months. I've never done it before, and I'm doing pretty well.
You know, I've worked my entire legal career for developers. They have been housing developers, primarily, on the West Coast and Hawaii.
Right.
And they make big bets. They make big bets. They win big, sometimes they lose big.
Right.
Is that mentality the one you're bringing to this race?
Well, a lot of people said no matter what happens with me, I can't lose, because I've comported myself very well. I've done very well. They're writing books about it. They're writing stories about it. And a person who you would know very well, but one of the most respected writers called me, and you know the story. He said you know, you could, it's been the summer of Trump, and it's been the whole autumn of Trump, and it's been amazing. I said no, it's only amazing if I win. And he said no, no, even if you don't win, it's been amazing what you've accomplished, because you've changed the whole political landscape, including the way you run for office. So my attitude is I want to win. I don't want to just do an amazing job so that the people say nice things about me in ten years from now.
OK, last...
But I find it, I find it very interesting.
Last question, Donald Trump, some people say you're divisive. Other people say you want to make America great again. I listened to your supporters very closely. You know, I went to Roman Catholic schools where they taught patriotism, they taught civics, they did assimilation.
Right.
Can you bring this country together, because it is very deeply divided?
It's totally divided. Our President is a great divider. He divides everybody. He is just the most divisive person. And this will sound strange to you, but I'm actually somebody that brings people together. You have to understand. I started out, I was running against 17. We had 17 people, and they're coming at me from every angle. And you have to be tough, and you have to be quick, and you have to be smart. And people are saying oh, he's divisive. Well, you know, now they're dropping out quickly, and they're dropping out. Every day, we seem to lose a couple. But you know, you had to be tough, and you had to be sharp. Now, it's sort of getting to be the way I like it. Now, I like it better. But you know, I am somebody that brings people together. And if I'm elected, our country will be brought back together.
You will have to pick a running mate. If you had to pick a running mate from those that are on the stage with you this weekend, who would you pick?
Well, I wouldn't say, but I will say I have great respect for a number of people that have been running, some of them are gone now, but have been running and are running. And at the right time, you and I will talk. Right now, I have to win first.
All right. Donald Trump, I will talk with you after New Hampshire. I put my money on you winning this thing. So don't collapse here in the last three days.
I'll do my best.
First of all, congratulations. You has a great couple of days since Iowa. How does it feel out there? There is a new CNN poll out shows you are doing well in New Hampshire. How does it feel?
Feels great. The people are great. I've been to New Hampshire so many times and have so many friends up here aside from this. And they are amazing people. It's a great place. I just like it. Feel comfortable.
Yes, he did. He came in second in this poll.
It was sort of funny because in Iowa, he was third and I was second and they said he did fantastically well and me they were disappointed. I don't know why they were disappointed because I got actually the most votes in the history of the Iowa caucus, for the Republicans. And we had a huge turnout. It was really a tremendous -- I mean, I must say, I really enjoyed Iowa. But this is -- there's a different feeling here. This is an amazing feeling with the people, the crowds. You probably saw the crowd this morning. It was incredible.
How important is it for you to win here?
Well, I would love to win because I like to win. I mean, my life is about winning.
You came in second in Iowa to Ted Cruz. Let's talk about Cruz. You have basically accused him of fraud of stealing the election in Iowa. You talked about wanting a new election there. Have you actually spoken to Republican Party officials about that?
I'm into New Hampshire now. It's just one of those things. It was a lot of strange things. And you know, I like Ben Carson very much. And he got pretty roughed up, frankly, although it affected me maybe more than Ben. But I'm so much, because I've been here now for two days, I'm so much into this, into New Hampshire that I just don't care about that.
One more on Ted Cruz. He did say that you basically had a Trumpertantrum. Had you ever heard that phrase before?
I haven't actually. I love that phrase. That's great. I love that phrase.
I want to have you meet some of the voters.
Great.
Some are supporters of you. Some are undecided at this point. I want you to Meet Brian Tilton. He is standing over there. He says he is leaning toward you.
Brian, you have to have dinner with me.
Hi. Since Obamacare passed, I've lost my health insurance three times.
Many people have.
My out-of-pocket expenses are sky high. I'm maxed out this year because I had surgery a couple months ago. And I don't have my doctor anymore because of Obamacare. I have heard you say you want to repeal and replace Obamacare. What are you going to replace it with?
OK. First of all, I have been so against Obamacare from the beginning, as you know. Repeal and replace. I was totally opposed to it. They did the $5 billion Website. $5 billion Website that didn't work. I have websites all over the place that cost 15 cents if you have the right person doing them, right? We're going to have great health insurance. We're going to bring the private sector in. We are going to get rid of the borders. You know, I am the only self- funder in this whole race on Democrat or Republican. The only self- funder, Anderson. I'm putting up my own money. When I come up here, it's costing me. It is not costing the public, it is not costing -- worse than the public, it's the insurance companies are putting up money for all of these people. The oil companies are putting up money. The drug companies are putting up money. And I'll tell you one quick story about that in a second. We're going to take down the borders because I have a lot of --
I was going to ask you about that because you said in the past it didn't last two days. You don't think you're getting credit for that.
Only the last couple of days. I put up a tremendous amount of money. I'm spending a lot of money on the campaign and I don't think it's appreciated. People have to understand. The reason Obamacare is so bad is because the insurance companies have taken care of the politicians. These politicians are the worst. All talk, no action. I am self-funding my campaign. I'm putting up my money.
You said you'd keep doing that, but it's not worth it. What do you meant?
What I'm saying is I don't think the voters give me any credit for it. I may be wrong. But I don't think when people, even in this room and we have great people in this room, when they go to vote, I don't think they are saying, you know, Trump is the only one out of now -- it started off 21, if you add both together, right. Out of 21 people, I'm the only one that's putting up my own money. And it's a lot of money. Now I'm an efficient person so I've spent a tiny fraction of what --
Yes, hi, Mr. Trump.
Hi, Tim. Hi, there.
I own a small restaurant here in Manchester and interact with young people on a daily basis. It's clear they don't trust Washington.
I don't either, Tim.
It's a...
Less anybody mean it. I've had too much.
... it's a polarized environment. And I feel like a lot of that is because of our most recent two presidents. What tools will you bring to the table to be able to work with people on both sides of the aisle?
It's a great question, you know, in Manhattan, I built a tremendous company. and somebody was mentioning today, I built a job, I built really a city on the west side of Manhattan, you know it very well in and it's Trump place. And it goes from 72 second to 59th street. I had to get zoning, you know this might sound simple. Whose was, Anderson, would understand, people that are in Manhattan.
Politically, though, you are polarizing but you're saying it once you get to Washington you can actually get things done?
I get along with people. Look, Ronald Reagan and Tip O'Neil were very opposite, they get along very great relations.
Is compromise a dirty word? For some politicians...
Compromises it's not a dirty word but we have to get a much better part of the compromise. It's not that dirty. I mean we have people that will never be able to make deals. You know, somebody heard, "Oh, he'll make deals." I'm going to make good deals. That's why I do. I made billions and billions of dollars while I'm making good...
There is some conservatives worry you'll make deals too much, that you compromise too much on conservatives principle.
I'm not a huge compromiser. I have to tell, I make a great deals. I make deals. I own some of the greatest assets of the world. People wanted them everybody...
OK, what does that mean? Take the lump out?
That means make it a little bit nicer.
Mr. Trump, hi. Thank you.
Are you liking me better at least?
Sure, kind of like you because I get to stand here.
Thanks, Joe.
Thank you so much for being here.
OK.
I have three wonderful daughters all and I want nothing more for them than to look ate their president at role model. And throughout the course of this campaign, you've said some disparaging comments about women, about people from other countries, other religions and about everybody who has disagreed with you. Explain to me how I can look at my daughters and have them look up to a president Trump as a role model.
Well first of all, nobody -- who asked you to give this question? Did Anderson?
No.
This is a CNN -- by the way, there's the CNN set-up at this one.
No, sir. It's not.
Nobody has more respect...
No.
Nobody has more respect for women.
Is that already a Muslim Islam or is it a radical Islamist problem?
Maybe it's a Muslim problem, maybe it's not. I had not -- look I have many Muslim friends. Some of them, not all of them, but some of them call me and said "Donald, you've done us a great service". There's tremendous hatred. At least you are starting a dialogue. We have a president that doesn't want to mention the term.
I want to introduce Patricia Cooper, she's a Trump supporter.
Thank you.
Thank you. One of the things I did yesterday was to look at your platform. I'm very excited about a lot of things you say. I love your ideas. We need all these changes, but sometimes when I read them, it's a statement but it's not really saying how are you going to do? There's so many things to do. How are you going to do them? How are you going to get in, you are in this -- your position and all of a sudden, I'm going in the economics. I've got to worry about ISIS, they got to do this.
The president can have a lot of things. We have to be high energy. We cannot be a low energy individual and do this job right. We have to be very high energy. It's a great question, look I have a lot of policy papers out. But in the end, Anderson, you know, your like you have 14 steps the president wants it more than the people. There are 14 steps, let's say taxes, 14 steps for. Step one, we'll going to do this. Step two, we'll do this We got to negotiate...
... your tone. Talking about tone, your tone -- how would it be different because just -- that's what -- some of your...
I understand.
... you believe in like your policies are worried about, you know, are you going to be tweeting in the middle of the night...
No.
That's why you don't need to spend so much money...
That's not so bad.
... because people were...
No, no. It's one of those things.
For charity events. Just for the record.
Oh that's...
I was speaking to -- for free, by the way, also.
I should have clarified. I was hoping you -- but Anderson, all of the big events, the Red Cross, all of them. I have the elite of society come. I have women that come where they, "Oh, Donald, how are you darling? Oh." They love me. And I'm very different.
Mr. Trump, so the war in Syria is obviously horrible and a lot...
Right.
... of Christian Syrians are trying to escape. What are your feelings on this and will you work faster to try to, you know, help these Christians leave that war and...
Right. Are you Christian?
28 years.
Oh you, so, you really, I grew up -- in all fairness, you saw a much different Syria it is.
Yes.
... as much safer place. So you have images probably that are a little bit different.
Yes, sir.
We will solve world's problems but with all of that...
Would you allow Syrian refugees who are Christian?
I will...
No.
OK. Almost everyone else does. They make -- no, they are an...
You're buying friends?
... whatever, whatever.
Yes. Hi, Mr. Trump. My question is, how much of an impact will your Christian faith have upon your decision-making process as president, and I ask that because my husband and I is Born-Again Christians.
Good.
Cruz did better.
He did, in Iowa, but in...
Right.
... nationwide I'm actually leading...
Why do you think Ted Cruz was able to get evangelicals with the entrance polls in Iowa, you lost to Cruz by 12 points among evangelicals?
I think he just, you know, he had a lot of support from the ministers, but so do I. I have Dr. Jerry Falwell. You know, Jerry is an amazing junior who's on the Jerry Falwell Jr....
Yeah.
... everybody by a lot and I'm very proud of that. Now, religion and Christianity plays a very big role.
I want you to meet Ryan Bernier. He's between jobs right. He's driving for Uber. He was supporting Rand Paul, now he says he's undecided.
Hey, Ryan.
Hello Donald. Thanks for coming to our state.
Sure.
The fact that you used to give money to Nancy Pelosi, to Hillary Clinton your opponents.
I get along with everybody.
I know, but your opponents there are -- or have already used that against you. No doubt will use that against you. More this...
I don't think success...
... part of the problem?
No. Yeah in a way I was, sure. I don't successfully. My opponents have used it. But look...
So you were buying access? That's what, that was about.
What I -- I was buying friends. I was buying...
You were buying friends?
You know whatever. Whatever. I mean I owed it to myself. I owed it to myself.
But the lips kind of moved in the --
Well, they might have. No, I didn't say the word. I wouldn't do that. Even I -- hey Bill, even I wouldn't do that, ok. No, I never said the word.
You do.
We make our point.
There is no doubt you make your point.
Sometimes you have to make a point. And you know, the other way doesn't work out so well.
I'm sure you were glued to the set this afternoon. President Obama announced the economy was improving. Jobs are 4.9 percent unemployment. Should we give the President credit for that?
Look, you can't give credit. The economy is having the worst -- it's so bad. Hey, Bill, every time I go out, I have packed auditoriums, packed rooms because people don't have jobs. They don't have the jobs they want.
Negotiated a better deal because we buy in bulk. But here's the thing.
And you know why. Bill, do you know why this is? Because the drug companies have all the politicians taking care of them.
Yes, the lobbyists.
They are all supporting all these politicians.
And nobody cares about it. Right.
But they are not supporting me because I'm self-funding, ok?
How are you going to bring down the debt though? Look, with all of the social security payments, with all of the Medicare payments, with all of the social welfare programs that we have, how is any human being going to bring down the debt? I mean, what are you going to do?
Ok, Bill, are you ready?
I'm ready.
We have a country -- we have a country with no growth. We have no growth. Last quarter, did you see that practically zero growth which is almost unheard of? When China does 7 percent, they are practically in a depression. We do nothing because our jobs are leaving. Our companies are leaving.
So you're going to grow it but how will that bring down the debt?
No, no. I will tell you how it is going to bring it back because we're going to create a dynamic economy again. We're going to bring the jobs back from China, from Mexico, from Japan.
But you still owe them money.
From Vietnam.
We still owe them money. So you bring it back, how are you going to get the debt down?
Because the country is going to start growing and we will be up to 4 and even 5 percent. And when we do that, we pay it back so easily.
How?
It's easy to pay it back.
How?
How? Because essentially if you look at the country like a profit- making corporation or a losing corporation -- right now we are a losing corporation -- we are going to make it a profit-making corporation.
Ok. But then you are going to have to raise taxes to get more money in to pay down that debt.
The problem we have is our taxes are so high that nobody can -- everybody is choking.
I don't know how -- even if you gin the economy up, how does that pay down $21 trillion? You have to take money from the corporations and people to do it.
Bill, the politicians have caused this problem. Just so you understand.
I understand that.
They have caused this problem over the years. Listen, the politicians have caused this problem. We're going to make our country dynamic again. Now, companies, big companies like Pfizer are leaving. They're going to make it worse. They're leaving. It's called corporate adversion -- many companies are leaving because the taxes are so high. We have to lower taxes not raise taxes.
All right. But if you cut the taxes again the revenue to pay down the debt then leaves. Ok. But that's for another day.
No. No the country will be more dynamic. It will be a dynamic. We are going to create a dynamic economy where real jobs are going to be pouring into the country and we'll have a country that is sustainable. It will work -- Bill.
Still the debt is still on the books. Now, you say you're going to be in the next --
You are going to slowly pay down the debt.
Ok. You are going to be in the next debate. You've confirmed that? Fox News debate in Detroit? You showing up.
Yes.
Do you want to confirm tonight that I was right telling you, you should have gone to the debate in Iowa? Do you want to confirm that too?
No, you weren't right. I don't know what impact that had.
Oh, I wasn't right? Why are you going to this one then?
Flip a coin. Flip a coin.
I don't have a coin.
Let me just tell you. I raised $6 million that night for the veterans.
We could have done that on any day. You're going to the one in Detroit, you didn't go to the one in Iowa. Can't you give me a little credit that I was right? Can't you give me a little credit?
I will give you a little credit but not too much.
I'll take that. You should have gone.
I raised $6 million for the veterans.
All right. Maybe we should have a telethon and pay down the debt.
That's another way of doing it. That's probably not a bad idea.
Mr. Trump, we're live on CNN. Thanks very much. Mr. Trump, so you did not lob any attacks at your opponents tonight. You were much more disciplined. Are you trying to show that side of yourself to the voters in New Hampshire?
It just worked out that way. I mean, I thought it was a very good debate. I thought the moderators did really an excellent job. It was really a good debate. I was very happy with my performance. Many people -- you know, it's, in the world of the Twittersphere, they're all saying I won the debate. So, I'm happy. I had to do well tonight and it was a lot of pressure tonight.
Why did you have to do well?
Because, you know, I have a lead, I guess, if polls mean anything, I have a lead. I don't know that I had to be outstanding but they're all saying I really did well.
You got a bit burnt by the polls in Iowa.
I did? I got burned by the fact that, you know, Ben Carson lost another votes. if those votes didn't go over to another person, I would have won Iowa. So, you know, that would have been nice, but I'm not thinking about Iowa any more. I thinking about New Hampshire.
Right; so in New Hampshire does it feel like you have double- digit lead, like ten points, 20 points, or does it feel close to you? How do you feel here?
I don't know and we're not going to know. it's easier to poll New Hampshire because you don't have the caucus system. The caucus system is very complex and very tricky. You saw that by what happened to Ben but I think we're going to do really well here and, you know, I've had a relationship with New Hampshire for many, many years. Many, many years and have so many friends up here, beyond the political stuff, so I think I'm going to do well. It was very important that I do a good job at the debate.
And you said after Iowa that you guys could have done better with a stronger ground game. How have you sharpened your ground game in New Hampshire? How confident are you that it's better?
Well I'm spending a lot of money on ground game. I think prob -- you know, personally, I think the debate tonight is more important than the ground game because in New Hampshire the people they like you and they're going to go out and vote and they're going to go back. There's not so much of a ground game. I think that our ground game's good but I really think the debate tonight was more important than the ground game.
Are you surprised more of your rivals didn't go up against you? Jeb is the only one that tried the take you on on stage?
Well, actually, if you look, Ted Cruz, they said did you say that and will you say that now, essentially, to his face and he didn't want to do that. I appreciated he didn't do that. Jeb tried to go, but Jeb is easy.
Now, what was going through your mind when you saw Marco Rubio give eventually the same response over and over again as Chris Christie was criticizing him as being too scripted?
Well he was scripted there. I don't know what happened. I mean, he said it after the fourth time I said I disagree with you. I think it's the exact opposite, about President Obama but it was a great debate. People really enjoyed the debate. It's getting high reviews. It's an honor for me to have been involved.
Do you look at Marco as your closest competitor here in New Hampshire?
I don't know. I mean, who knows? Maybe the one last, maybe the last place winner, whoever that may be, will be my closest competitor. I look at them all. They're all very smart people. they're all good people. I look at all of them as my competitor.
When you hear them asking you questions about eminent domain; do you think that's something voters in New Hampshire are listening tom that they care about? Do you think that could affect you here?
I was so happy they asked me that question because eminent domain is a very important thing for a country. I mean, wouldn't have highways. You wouldn't have schools. You wouldn't have bridges. You wouldn't have airports. You wouldn't have anything. The other things is, when the government takes your property, they pay you a fortune for it. You know, they said, Donald Trump likes eminent domain. I don't like it, it's a necessity. They also said it's called a taking. I'm in real estate. I'm very good at real estate, but it's called a taking, a taking of the property but people don't realize a taking means you get paid. They don't just take it. They take it and then they pay. If you're smart, you'll get much more than the value of your property.
Now one of the issues they put Marco Rubio on the spot tonight was about his view on abortion, that there should not be any exceptions for rape, incest, life of the mother. Do you think that's too extreme of a stance, even in a Republican primary?
He said no exceptions. I do believe in the three exceptions, yes.
I'm curious, in the wake of the loss in Iowa, have you made any changes to your staff?
Excuse me, it wasn't a loss.
The second place -
It was second. 17 people started and some went out. It's the first election I was ever involved in. I came in second and probably came in first. I mean, if you take away --
How do you probably come in first?
Because all you have to do is take way the Ben Carson that you people sort of slipped up on, but I'm not blaming CNN because actually CNN -- it was not CNN's fault.
It was not. CNN did not report that Ben Carson was suspending -
You also came out with a tweet a minute later, in case there was any question, but you take away those thousands of votes -- in fact, one of the big shows on FOX did a study, it was "Bill O'Reilly" and they said if that doesn't happen, Trump probably wins Iowa.
So you think you would have won if the Cruz campaign had not done that.
You know what it amounts to? Four votes per precinct. But I don't care about that anymore because I'm totally into something else. You know what it is? New Hampshire. So I hope you had a good time.
Donald Trump, thanks so much for joining us. We will see you on the campaign trail. Good luck on Tuesday.
Thank you very much, Jake.
Well, it was the state Supreme Court.
But let me -- we could have gone higher. But let me just tell you, George, I decided not to do it. I decided not to pursue it. We could have --
That was George W. Bush.
That doesn't matter. It was the Bush family. They used private eminent domain. He didn't tell anybody this. So I mean, he should have told people. Maybe -- he probably doesn't know because I don't even think he knows what eminent domain is. But I just found that out five minutes ago.
As president, you would authorize torture?
I would absolutely authorize something beyond waterboarding. And believe me, it will be effective. If we need information, George, you have our enemy cutting heads off of Christians and plenty of others, by the hundreds, by the thousands.
Do we win by being more like them?
Yes. I'm sorry. You have to do it that way. And I'm not sure everybody agrees with me. I guess a lot of people don't. We are living in a time that's as evil as any time that there has ever been. You know, when I was a young man, I studied medieval times. That's what they did, they chopped off heads. That's what we have...
So let me just clarify this. Right now, the law says they have to follow the Army "Field Manual, " which prohibits...
Right.
You know, you -- there was another issue that came up last night. You -- you just cited how you always were against the Iraq War. Fact checkers have gone through and haven't seen any statements of you against the war until after it began.
In 2003 to 2004, I was against the war. That's probably the first time. Now, again, I wasn't a politician, George. I'm not somebody that you would interview. I was a businessman.
But just last Sunday, you said you would strongly consider appointing justices who would overturn it.
I'm talking about bringing people together and we -- I would appoint justices. It would take a long time, frankly, because I don't know how long it would take to appoint a...
-- that Supreme Court decision?
If they -- if they -- I would appoint them and we will see how they will vote but I would...
But how does that move us to equality?
We'll find out. I mean we're going to find out. There's a lot of people that want to see that. But I would, I'd -- more important than anything else to me, this country is so divided right now, as per her question. This country is so totally divided, it's probably almost never been as divided as it is right now and we have to bring it together.
And how does that move us toward equality for gays and lesbians?
Well, I think what will happen is -- and, look, George, it's very simple. We're going to bring our country together. We're going to unify our country. We're going to do whatever we have to do. I'm going to put the absolute bed -- best judges in position. If their views -- we're going to see what their views are. I will make the determination at that time.
But what do you say to gays and lesbians who think that overturning that decision is not unifying our country, it's dividing our country?
Well, I think I understand what they're saying and we're going to see what happens. It's a long way off, George. It's a long way off.
What's happening here in New Hampshire?
I think we're doing well. I think it's going well. I think our ground forces are good. I think I had a good debate last night.
Better than Iowa?
Well, I think I did very well in Iowa. I came in first or second, depending on how you want to count the Carson vote. I mean depending on how you want to count that, I came in either first or second out of originally 17 people.
Who's standing between you and the nomination right now?
I don't know. It's a long way to go, George. To me, it's a long way to go. I mean I see these wonderful poll numbers, but they don't mean anything to me. I just don't know about polls. I don't know if they're accurate. When they interview 300 people and then they come up with this brilliant poll, to me, the people in New Hampshire have to get out, have to vote and hopefully they're going to vote for Trump, because I'm going to do a good job.
We'll see you on the trail.
Thank you.
Are you looking at your campaign and saying, you know what, maybe I need to do some more traditional things in addition to the nontraditional stuff that's been successful.
That is true. And I think that you'll see it here. Very important was that we get through the debate. Because I didn't want to have a bad debate or even a modest debate. And I think we did very well in the debate according to all...
Oh, there you go.
But I really thought I'd be up to about $45 million or $50 million. And, you know, I'm not. I look at somebody like Jeb Bush who has spent over $100 million and he's nowhere and I say how does that happen?
OK. What's the worse?
Well, you didn't see what I said before that. What I said before that was in the Middle East you have people chopping other other people's heads. This hasn't happened since Medieval times. There's never been anything like this. And I talked about that.
don't you worry though, look, we're the United States, we set an example. We're supposed to be better than that. We're supposed to be -- as much as, look, we're looking at the Medieval...
Sure.
We don't do those things.
Medieval times.
Another part of the debate had to do with health care. And, look, you've been hit on this. It is unclear to me, though, you want more government -- you want some sort of government system on health care.
Yeah.
You don't like the system that's in there now. That I understand. but describe...
But not single-payer...
Describe the system you want.
Let me explain.
Well, that is a fact. Thanks.
I never even heard this. I haven't seen the report.
I believe he is referring to Andrea Mitchell.
I am referring to Andrea.
So you're not doing a one-term pledge?
No, I'm not going to do a one-term pledge, no. If I'm doing a good job I'll keep going.
Donald Trump, I have to leave it there. We'll see you in South Carolina.
Thank you very much.
Of course I have to ask you about a moment that a lot of people are talking about, the debate last night the opening --
Yeah.
-- when they were calling your names, Ben Carson's name was called. He didn't go out and then it looked like you were just kind of hanging out the make him feel better; what happened?
Well, it wasn't ben's fault. You couldn't hear anything. I mean, Ben stood there and I was saying Ben I thought I head your name but I'm not sure and you could not hear anything; it was crazy. There was a man back there who didn't know too much about what he was doing and nobody really knew what was happening. I just said hey I'm going to go out, what difference does it make and I walked out and Ben didn't, but it was not Ben's fault because you could not hear a thing?
But did you hang out with him because --
I did.
-- you could tell it was not going well for him.
I didn't know what was going on. I was saying what's going on here. This is not the way to start a debate, but it was a great evening, actually; the way it turned out, but the opening was a little bit different.
Let's talk about New Hampshire and the state of the race now. Who do you think is your biggest competition at this point?
You never know. I mean, the polls have come out just about 2 minutes ago, and it looks very good. But the debate polls, I think I did well in the debate. Most of the people said I did either well or won it. And it was very important for me to have done well in that debate.
Why?
I just think I needed that. I think it was a good thing.
Why?
Well, I think just based on what I'm hearing about the debate. I wasn't focused on him. I focus on myself so I don't know.
Why aren't you focused on him? Because he is the person who has a lot of buzz. Aside from you. You clearly have a lead in a lot of the polls. He's got a lot of buzz here in New Hampshire. It seems uncharacteristic for you not to be focused on him.
Well, I'm watching everybody. You know, I don't know if it is going to be him or someone else. I didn't think Bush did well in the debate. I thought he did not well at all. I think that a couple of them didn't do too well. That's not for me to say. That's really for you to say who did well. As long as you say I did well, that's all that matters, OK.
I have to say talking to you now, watching you at your rally a couple days ago here in New Hampshire, I want to ask who are you and what have you done with Donald Trump?
Why?
Because you really seemed to have changed your tone. You have gone back to basics. You're really not engaging. It's not happening now. I'm wondering if --
You mean that in a positive way? I hope so.
I was wondering if you think that all of that was overshadowing your core message, which really does appeal to people. That you are not bought and sold. You can make deals.
Well, I've developed a certain confidence. You know, I've never done this before, Dana. I am a businessman. I've been a very successful businessman. I've never been involved with politics other than on the other side.
I've noticed that in the past couple of day's you've been talking about something your father used to say to you which is take the lumps out.
Yeah.
Are you taking the lumps out right now?
I think so.
The way you described it is, you know what -- I don't know what he called you, Donald or Donnie, you know what, be nicer sometimes.
Well my father did, he had the expression, take the lumps out. I used that when I said I'm not giving Iran back the $150 million that we just handed them.
Are you also using it in terms demeanor now?
It's possible. It's possible. I mean, I feel very good. I feel very good about the campaign. I feel very good about the way it's going. We're doing really well up in New Hampshire. I do hear there's a snowstorm Coming, which I'm not happy about, but I guess we can't stop that but we're feeling very good. I think the debate was very important last night. I'm glad it's over. I'm glad we did well. So, I mean, Tuesday's going to be a big day. I'm very, very happy the debate is over with, but I enjoyed the experience.
You keep saying that. It's almost like you feel -- you look like you felt relief --
No, no. There was a lot of pressure on the debate. I'll be honest. for everybody, not just for me.
Sure.
And there is more pressure when I see you and all of your people and everybody else saying this is a vital debate for Trump. I wish I didn't hear it. When I hear Jeremy saying this debate is vital for Trump, you know, it makes it more pressure, and I have always liked pressure, to be honest with your; I've sort of liked pressure and it came out very well.
One last question, you did very well in Iowa. I'm not taking that away from you but you know because you built a brand on understanding that perception is everything and the perception, because of the polls, was that you would win Iowa. So if you don't win in New Hampshire, what is that going to do to your political brand? Is it going to be damaged?
So if I had two seconds, I think I'm doing OK. I'd much rather win. I could say to you if I came in second or third I'd be thrilled, OK, and that way we'd lower ex -- I know about expectations. We lower expectations. if I came in second, I wouldn't be happy; OK? So now if I come in second you can go around and say, boom. No, I would much prefer to win in New Hampshire.
And what would it mean down road, I mean, about getting the nomination?
I think we'll do fine. I mean, look, we're going to do very well I think in South Carolina. We have tremendous numbers there. I think the SEC is going to be great. Nevada is a place I have major holdings. I have thousands of employees there. I think we're going to do well all the way down the line and we hope to do really well on Tuesday.
Is your campaign changing at all after New Hampshire -- because of New Hampshire?
Well, you mean because of Iowa?
You want a big turnout.
I want a big turnout, and snowstorms generally don't help.
Boy, it looks like --
But we are doing really well.
We can tell. I always say to people, listen, if you question anything about Donald Trump, look at his kids. You've got great children and that says something -- that says something about you.
That's so nice, so nice.
Thank you, Donald Trump. We forward to seeing you next week in the studio live and in color.
Well, thank you. We'll see you next week, absolutely. I love it. Thank you.
OK we have someone on the phone. He's just kind of a last minute thing because I guess we're hoping he's here tomorrow, but joining us by phone, Republican presidential candidate, Donald Trump. Good to have you on the phone this morning.
Good morning. I loved listening to Chris. That was great. He is a talented guy. Now he's more talented than I thought, but he's great. Thank you, Chris, very much.
Hey, Donald, good morning. It's Willie.
Hi, Willie. Hi.
Well, I think up here, Donald, that the voters vote because they're citizens first and you vote.
Right.
All right. And by the way, we love Iowa and we love the people of Iowa, especially Java Joes, but the caucus system, the caucus system, I -- they need to clean that up, especially on the Democratic side.
I agree.
Good morning, Mr. Trump.
Hi Mark.
You're on the eve of potentially winning the New Hampshire primary. That would be an historic achievement. I'm wondering if you are at all sentimental about that prospect and how you think a win here would affect your prospects in South Carolina?
Well, you know, I went to South Carolina two nights ago, Mark. You saw that I had a stadium. We had -- on four days notice, they had four days and they filled it. It was 12,000 people came in and it was an amazing feeling. And we're doing tremendously down in South Carolina. Some people -- I think I heard Joe say that maybe he thinks that's going to be one of my strongest states. And so I think we're going to do really well down there. I hope we're going to do really well in New Hampshire. I have a great bonding with the people in New Hampshire. They know what I'm going to do. You know, because, you know, they have a big vet problem up here, the veterans, a tremendous veteran problem, and they know how I am with the vets and nobody knows what I do with the vets. So they understand it. So I think I'm going to do well here and I think I -- I will do well in South Carolina, too. I think I'm going to do well in the SEC generally.
What would a win in New Hampshire, though, mean to you personally? That achievement?
Well, it would mean a lot. And that's why I hate -- I don't know if the snow comes and I don't even know what it means if it comes. You know, what does it mean? Does it mean people don't go out and vote? I guess maybe some people won't. But I don't care -- it's got to be very bad. But I'd love to have a great win up here. I've been friendly with this area for many years and, you know, the relationships I have. And all of my friends say you're going to have a tremendous night, but we will see what happens. Who knows. I mean, I just assume you have to keep working -- we're having an event tonight, we're going to have 4,000 or 5,000 people over at the Verizon arena. And just sort of a lot -- we're going to have a lot of fun tonight, we're going to have a little bit of a rally tonight. But I think we will have 4,000 or 5,000 people tonight and it's going to be very exciting.
Donald Trump, thank you.
Hey Chris, thank you very much, Chris. I appreciate it.
"HARDBALL" tonight, sir.
OK, good. You have a deal.
I hear you fine.
OK, good.
He's not just attacking you, he's attacking, as you point out, Marco Rubio, as well. And at that Republican presidential debate --
I know, but why would he say that Marco Rubio is his friend? He just said -- I heard it! On your show. I'm just waiting --
Well, what do you -- what was your reaction --
I just told you -- hey, Wolf, excuse me, I just told you about eminent domain. He was talking about eminent domain; he used it on Texas stadium. He didn't use it because he's not smart enough to use it, but it was his --
His family, his brother and other members of the family are directly involved in the Texas Rangers -- apparently he wasn't directly involved.
You're right, Wolf. But how can he criticize me for using eminent domain and his own family used it?
What about Ted Cruz?
Well, thought he was doing really well. I mean, he was doing really well, but he doesn't seem to be doing so well up here.
You think he cheated in Iowa?
Say it, Wolf?
A quick question about Ted Cruz, who won in Iowa, at least officially according to Republicans. Before the Republican debate over the weekend, he had said you do not have -- his words -- the temperament to be President of the United States. He was asked about that at the debate and refused to say that in front of you. He wouldn't say in front of you what he said earlier. What does that say to you about him?
It says that he respects me and he respects me a lot. And a lot of these guys will talk big, but in front of you they won't talk. So what that says is he respects me, and I respected him for not saying it, because it shows that he had -- he has a great deal of respect toward me. I respect the fact he didn't say it, frankly. I was surprised, frankly, because politicians will say anything.
Let me wrap it up with one question, because it's a CNN report that we're just getting in from our Paul Cruickshank, our terrorism analyst. It's an important story, CNN now reporting that there was evidence that there were 60 ISIS fighters on the ground in Europe to carry out attacks on five cities in Europe, including Paris, London, Berlin, and in Belgium. And presumably they're still there right now. If you were President of the United States, what would you do about that?
I would knock the hell out of ISIS, Wolf. I would knock them out and they would be gone so fast. And I'd use the full force. We would take care of them. It's -- it's a cancer on the world. And this whole migration, letting these people in and they may be ISIS, is insane. Look at what's happening in Germany, look at what's happening in Europe. You've just seen the beginning. We have no idea where they come from. You've got to knock them out and you've got knock them out fast.
You want to give us details how you would do that?
I don't want to do that now, no. The last thing I want to do is that. You have to have a little bit surprise every once in a while without telling our plans.
Donald Trump joining us on the phone from New Hampshire. Mr. Trump, thanks very much.
OK, thank you very much, Wolf. An honor.
What did you make of Marco Rubio doing an imitation from "The Blade Runner"? He just started repeating himself, repeating himself. Six times! He repeated. Whole speaks parts. What was it --
I was standing right next to him. I don't know what it was. But I was standing right there. And he's a nice guy. He's been very nice to me, I must say. But I heard it once. I heard it a second time. I have, like, a good memory. Then I heard it a third time. I said, I think it was the exact same thing. It wasn't even like, I know you've replayed it. And then after the fifth time, I said, I wonder if he's going to do it once more. But it was a little bit --
Let's talk about how you get it done. Now, we know about the wall. We know about your -- I think it appeals to a lot of people. But here's what happens. You get inaugurated. You take the oath. You have the ball, the party. That night you come back to the Oval Office. You get a call from the speaker of the House. Say it's Paul Ryan. "You know, Mr. Trump, I think that idea of yours of building a wall is disgraceful. I won't even bring it up for a vote. What do you do?"
I'm going to get it done, Chris. I'm --
No, he'll just say to you, I'm not bringing it up.
He may say that, but he may also go along with me a hundred percent. And I think that my history is that I cajole, and I get people to do what they have to do.
What are your tools?
Washington -- me. Washington is in gridlock right now. You understand --
That's where it belongs.
OK, about nine. No, no, we're going to make things better. We're going to bring it up. We're going to get things done.
OK, let's talk about your experience. When you put up a building in New York, and there it is, that big building on Fifth Avenue, Trump Tower --
Which they all said you could never get zoning.
How do you get it done? How do you get it done?
I'm the king of zoning.
But how do you do it? What's your technique? Fear? Bullying?
I deal with people. I hire experts. No. I hire people that are good --
Do you pay these guys?
They're consultants and I --
No, do you pay the --
I don't, no, I don't. The problem is if you do -- first of all, it's dishonest and I'm an honest guy. But if you do that, you know what happens? Everybody else comes along, and it never ends. If you don't do it, it's like the old story. You take care of building inspectors, all the building inspectors hear about it, they all come to you. I don't do it.
What else have wise guys committed say you're not building?
Well, I've known tough cookies over the years.
I mean wise guys.
I know what you mean by wise guys. I've known very tough people. I've known people that make the politicians that you and I deal with every day look like little babies. They'd walk across the street out of fear if they ever saw some of these guys. I deal with people that are very tough people, and I get it done. I deal with people that are heads of countries because I'm all over the world. My company is all over the world. I get along great with people.
He was the boss of Brooklyn.
Mean Esposito -- he was the boss. Mean Esposito, in his own way, was a very, very honest guy. When he gave you his word on something, it was done. I deal with politicians. They give you their word, it's like -- it means nothing. Mean Esposito in a certain way was a very honorable guy.
She's not playing any cards. Let me ask you about the old names. Why are the Clintons, both of them, having troubles this time? Bill on the campaign trail. Well, you basically pushed him out with that thing about sexist charges --
They have not said a bad thing about me since I said --
I know. You've pushed him off the trail.
Were you impressed? Were you impressed?
Why don't you like a nice old guy?
I'll tell you why. He spent $20 million on ads against me, which he shouldn't have done. He should have focused on people that are ahead of him. But he spent $20 million, they're false ads and he says false things about me. I mean, he says so much. He talks about the Second Amendment. Nobody's stronger than Second Amendment than me. He would make it believe like I'm not. He brings up taxes. I have the biggest tax decrease of anybody else and he makes it sound like I'm going to eat it.
What about the stadium?
He's really -- the stadium is another one. Eminent domain, thank you very domain. Eminent domain. He talks about me with eminent domain. It just came out this morning that his father and the group, the Bushes -- not him because he's not smart enough to do it, but his group used eminent domain to get the stadium bought -- the land around the stadium bought in Texas. So he's very embarrassed by it. Let me tell you. He's not going anywhere. He just announced he spent $120 million on the campaign. He just announced about 20 minutes ago that he's against now against super PACs. Well, he spent most of the money in his super PAC, and now he announces that he is against super PACs. It's really pretty --
By the way, it's not since The French Revolution they did a lot of guillotine --
All right, well, I used medieval times.
They did, they did.
But not since I said --
They've been drawing and quartering in England in the 19th century.
You're right, but you know, medieval times made more of an impression, I guess. But I said, not since medieval times have we talked about chopping off heads. I know the parents of James Foley. I see what --
Let's talk about that guy. Because I carry his picture in my wallet. And I think we share that.
Great guy. Right.
To me, he was a man of noble courage --
Great parents, by the way.
Noble courage right to the end. He saw what was happening to him, he knew he was going to reach his end on this earth.
I agree.
He stood his ground and never buckled. What a great man.
A hundred percent.
No, I'm not getting at anything. I don't know the answer.
Well, they're tough answers. They're always tough answers.
Good for you.
And he was great.
What would you do? If it was you in fold?
I would never negotiate --
What WOULD you do?
I would -- what I'd really like to do --
Would you try to stop it?
Yes, I would try and stop it.. I would do everything I could to redefine the area --
Would you bomb?
I would bomb, I would do whatever I could to stop it. The one thing I would never do is pay ransom. Because once you pay ransom, it's over.
You've paid tribute -- some of the Republican candidates have paid tribute saying that the minute he came in in 1981, they sent the hostages back. What was he threatening with implicitly? There must be something --
He said they will not be there when I'm president.
They did that to punish Carter anyway.
No.
Where's this power? How do you use --
I think he was a little bit scared. I watched that. And Carter was a nice man, but you know, they had no fear of Carter for whatever reason. OK.
How do you demonstrate strength so they don't take our hostages? How do you get the message across like Reagan did, don't mess with me? Because strength is a lot about the appearance of strength. How do you create that?
I think the strike in his case was good. But I think it's almost an air that some people have, not a lot of people --
Do you have it?
Well, I don't ever want to be saying that I have it. I mean, you obviously think I do because I --
Have you been impressed by any opponent in this campaign? Personally impressed? "Wow that guy --
Well, I wouldn't want to tell you yes. Yeah, a couple of them are impressive. Some of them are unimpressive. I mean, I think Jeb Bush to me is very unimpressive. Very unimpressive.
I noticed. How about Kasich?
Yeah, he's got something that's OK. I mean, he's got something. He's done a good job. Now, he got help with fracking, in all fairness. When you frack --
Do you know how many Democrats I bump into that like Kasich?
I like him!
No, as a candidate.
No, I like him. I like him, too. He was very nice; then he went hostile on me. Kasich went very hostile in the second debate.
I know, but you're the frontrunner. He's king of the hill. You know how that works. Do you think he would be a good running mate for you?
I think he would. I'm not thinking running mates now --
Ohio. Ohio.
Well, I have very good poll numbers in Ohio.
You got to win Ohio.
You have to win Ohio, you have to be at Florida.
How do you get Florida?
Well, right now, I'm at 48 percent in Florida. I'm at 48, Bush is at like 6, and Rubio, I think, is at 11. And I'm at 48. And I'm saying, what do I need anybody for, right?
OK, got one big problem. Rubio proved the other day he repeats himself.
That's not good.
So he'll repeat himself in this regard. He will say, I won again. They guy's --
How big of an impact does it have long term. Short term it has an impact. Will that affect him long term?
Lost. You don't seem as happy as you were last week.
Really? I think I'm happier now. With those polls -- you just showed me those polls. That makes me very happy.
How do you make China change its currency policies?
By telling them that if you don't change, you're going to have a hard time trading with us.
And what do we do about our debt problem with China if we stop trading with them?
We work out a deal with them.
See, they got -- don't they have us by the shorts?
No, we have them.
Because they have our paper!
Excuse me. We have them. They need our money to come in. Chris, we have them, and nobody's --
Who's carrying our debt?!
It doesn't make any difference.
All right, late breaking news, last question. The counter on the former president of Mexico president says he won't pay for the wall. What's it mean to you?
OK. He'll pay. Trust me, he'll pay. We have such a trade imbalance with Mexico, we have such a trade deficit, the wall is peanuts compared to anything else.
Would you get rid of NAFTA?
I would get rid of it or amend it greatly. NAFTA has been a disaster, especially for New Hampshire and areas like this.
Thank you.
Thank you.
So even in the snow, snowstorm, you got what, 5,000 people at least over there.
We have a lot of people. I know we've had three of our people in accidents already tonight, so I don't know how many can show up. And we 7,000 say they were going to show up. We have a big storm tonight.
Last two days, the polls, you have not been below 30. Things are certainly looking good for you. How do you feel about things on the ground?
Well, we hope so. We have a good ground game. We have good everything. And we'll just see what happens. You know, it's still an election, no matter what. And we're going to see. But we feel very good about it.
Let's talk about the debate Saturday night. It was interesting to me because I watched you. I thought you had a very good debate. And I watched Ted Cruz. Everybody's going after Marco Rubio. Is it because they think you're inevitable in New Hampshire? They think...
Well, they were going after him, and it was sort of a tough night for him, but I will tell you they were going after him, and I was a little surprised to see it. I felt quite good, actually.
Yes.
I loved that.
Well...
Not because they went after him, but really, nobody other than Jeb, and Jeb is easy, but nobody really came after me.
And in the case that was mentioned here, you did not take the woman's home.
I never took it. No, we never took it. And could have taken it and could have bought it at some point. But we didn't, which was a good thing because Atlantic City was not exactly a thriving destination. Worked out well for me, but I never did take it, no.
I don't see a brokered convention.
I don't see it. I don't see it. A lot of people talk about it, but I don't see it.
I think there's people trying to make money through punditry, and a lot of people...
Yes, it's interesting.
Hillary Clinton says that Donald Trump doesn't think America's great. You campaign slogan is "Make America great again."
Right.
What do you say to Hillary?
Well, I think America is great, but it could -- I mean, it's -- look, it's troubled. You report on it every single night.
When you meet people that are losing their homes, don't have a job -- almost 100 million Americans out of the labor force...
True.
... and you meet these people and they tell you their stories, does that motivate you more to run? Does that say -- justify in your mind, This is why I got into this?
It does motivate me. And you know what? Look, I could be doing so many other things right now. It's wonderful standing with you and talking to you in a hotel room, but to be honest with you...
You're thinking about those people out of work, in poverty, on food stamps, out of the labor force.
Well, I am and...
I don't know where they get that calculator in Washington. But if you used it in your business, they would handcuff you and send you to jail.
That was developed years ago, in all fairness, long before Obama, to make presidents look good and to make the economy look good. But when you hear less than 5 percent -- and honestly, I probably wouldn't even be running. I wouldn't get these crowds if we didn't have -- if you had really 5 percent unemployment, you wouldn't have crowds showing up like show up for this.
If you get to the White House, are you going to remember those people that told you about their lost job, their lost homes, they can't -- older people can't live in New York, for example. They can't afford the taxes.
Not only remember them, Sean, we're bringing jobs back from China, from Mexico, from Japan, from Vietnam. That's a new one. But they are just killing us. We're bringing from all over the world. We're going to start bringing our jobs back. They're killing us with devaluation and manipulation of the currency. They're just killing us. Me, I understand it. Obama, he doesn't understand it.
If I could get you to project in your mind, you win the election, you're in the White House, who are the type of people you want to surround yourself with?
Great people and different people. We have the best business people anywhere in the world. We're going to use them for trade. I mean, we're using right now political hacks for trade. Military, I'm going to pick the people. We're going to get the right people, not people that go on even your show and talk on your show. I mean, I see these generals...
Yes. Would you, if president, would you go to the private trust, a secret trust where you don't know anything about your business?
I would do that. And you know, my children are very capable and I have great executives. So I would do that. And my executives and my children would run my companies.
It's funny because you've been hard on some of the other candidates at different times in the campaign. As you look at the slate of candidates, 17, and you're leading in the polls, if you win that nomination, if you won the job, would you pick some of those guys to work with you, hire them?
I would. Some are very good. And I can't obviously tell you who because...
Sure you can. You can tell me whatever you want. You're Donald Trump. You can say anything you went.
Some are very good, and some I don't have much respect for, I mean, to be honest with you.
Yes.
But some of them are very good, and I could see some of them working with me and straightening out our country and making America great again.
Do you give any thought to a VP choice?
I don't give much thought to it. And look, there are so many out there, so many really good, talented people. And I would have maybe two or three, but I don't want to think about it. I want to think about closing the deal. I want to close the deal. I want to get it done, get it closed, get -- and we have plenty of time. I would speak to lots of people about it, and lots of people that know me, including you, by the way.
Right. One of the best things in "The Art of the Deal " is you say any moment, you should be willing to walk away. Never want a deal that bad.
Right. Well, we should have walked away from the Iran deal five times. We could have made that deal so much better. We never walked. I mean, they were dancing in the streets of Iran. They were dancing all over the country...
Scary.
We made it possible for them to take over Iraq. That's an even better deal.
We'll see if the Sunnis and Saudi Arabia will protect their own territory, their own lands and stand up against the rise of the Shia and the Iranian mullahs in Iran.
Well, when they go into Yemen...
... fighting them from Yemen...
They don't want Yemen for Yemen. They want Yemen because of that nice beautiful long border along Saudi Arabia.
Welcome.
Sit down, Joe.
So, obviously, we were telling people about the event last night -- 4 to 5,000 people in a snow storm. And I'm just wondering how you're feeling this morning -- Iowa, obviously, all the polls had you ahead.
A little bit.
All the polls have you ahead here.
I thought I won Iowa.
Yeah. How are you feeling this morning?
I feel good, I feel good. We had a great night and it was an amazing event in a snow storm, in a blizzard. So, I feel very good.
Yeah.
But so many people come that it's sort of not right. Mark understands that, because he has seen it.
Do you think he would be a candidate, or are you saying...
Yeah, I think he's good. He's different.
I agree with that.
And spent a lot of money on doing a lot things.
Changing it.
He got a third term. And then, there was a snow storm, it was a disaster. And I think he would have been a lot better if he didn't take the third.
... into building ground games in South Carolina...
Yeah.
Across the deep south, and some of the other key states?
Sure. Well, I'm $45 million under budget. By this time, I thought I'd spend X -- what have I spent, $12 million or $15 million, and most of it is paying myself back for my airplane. I haven't had to do a lot of advertising. And you know, I go -- I don't know if I'm a believer in polls or not, but I go by the polls and I do a lot of television and you can't do that much television, and then on top of it, you have an ad and then more television and an ad. People would say I can't watch this guy anymore. So I'm way -- I mean, I'm at least $45 million under where I thought I'd be at this point.
Willie Geist.
I don't know who he is. I don't know, but I like him.
He -- yes, he has a sign he wants to give you.
Does he? Oh, wow.
Donald, in public at least, you're not the most reflective or sentimental person I know. But if you think about...
But in private?
But have you been surprised along the way at how well you've done? I mean, when you stood at the top of that escalator on June 16th, did you think you'd be the here as the favorite to New Hampshire?
Well, I'm happy about it. And I've given up a lot. And you know, it takes guts to run for...
He would be coming in to stop you.
Well, you know, he's...
But he would -- he would really...
... got very different views from me.
He could end up electing...
He and I have very different views.
What was the project?
The big project called Ferry Point in the Bronx. It was a disaster. Probably under construction for 30 years and I got it done. I really got -- I...
So let me ask you, how did you...
I did him a big favor.
I always ask leadership questions, this is a good leadership question to ask. How did you get it done?
Because I know how to build, I know how to get it done. I mean, that's what I do. The thing I do best is build. When you have an infrastructure of a country like ours that is absolutely decaying and rotting and falling apart and we -- by the way, we're spending $5 trillion in the Middle East instead of doing what we're supposed to be doing. We have to knock the hell out of ISIS and all, but we have to get back to rebuilding our country because you look at our airports, our roadways, our tunnels, our bridges -- 67 percent of them are in trouble.
And let me ask you about something that did happen last night, because people have criticized the tone of this campaign. What was going through your mind when that woman shouted a word out and you went with it and sort of...
I didn't -- we were all just having fun. It was a great moment, I got a standing ovation, the place went wild. Somebody said mixed cheers. Let me tell you, the place went wild.
No, I saw that.
Standing ovation. You know, you're talking about close to 5,000 people. standing ovation, went totally wild. And all I was doing is repeating, because people couldn't hear it, so I was doing everybody a favor.
You think on your feet so well.
The world of politically correct.
Oh, good Lord. I'm scared to do this, actually.
Go ahead.
It's so funny you should say that. Marco Rubio.
All right. Confused.
Ted Cruz.
I was going to say nasty. He's not really nasty, I mean, he has been very nice, he only goes on and off. I'll say nasty.
Wow.
Yeah. She did. She did. She did. In a certain way, evil. In a certain way, evil.
Whoa. Bill Clinton.
Intelligent.
All right. Donald Trump.
A lot nicer than people think.
So, funny, you should say that. Marco Rubio.
Confused.
Wow.
She did. She did. She did. In a certain way evil. In a certain way evil.
Whoa. Bill Clinton.
Intelligent.
And with me now, here in Manchester, is the Gop front-runner, Donald Trump. Thank you so much for joining us.
Thank you very much.
First sometime in my 30 years on television, you're talking about a p-word and it's not policy.
It's true. We were having a lot of fun last night. I was repeating something that somebody said from the audience. And it was cute. I mean, the whole place gave a standing ovation. They were having fun. We didn't want to be too politically correct. Not the worst thing. But I was actually repeating a word. A woman kept shouting a certain word, so I repeated it, and people had a lot of fun with it.
What do you mean when you say politically correct?
Well, I think people don't want to --
What do you mean by that?
And that word was really sort of a repeat of a word that somebody else was saying. But I think that the political correctness of -- within our country now is too much. It's too much.
Give me example. What do you mean?
All right, I'll tell you, anchor baby. We had a case where a man from CNN, one of the reporters, good guy from CNN, said, well, the anchor baby, because I was talking about anchor babies, where people come over, they have a baby in the United States.
But they're also being deported in larger numbers than any other administration.
Well --
So let me talk to you about your plan. I know earlier in the year, you -- last year, at the end of last year, you released your immigration plan, a five-point plan. We've not heard much more since then so let's go by the numbers. You've talked a lot about building the wall, the very big wall. How much will the wall cost? Have you looked into the numbers?
The wall -- yes, sure I did. The wall is probably $8 billion, which is a tiny fraction of the money that we lose with Mexico. We lose a tremendous amount of trade deficits. We have a trade deficit with Mexico that is astronomical, much bigger than that. We will get -- and I say it also is also part of my plan -- Mexico is going to play for the wall.
So you're doing construction numbers here.
I'm very good at that.
Yes, but you're doing construction numbers, not real numbers, not numbers of what it would cost.
No, no, I'm talking about --
You bring up for example the Great Wall of China that was built with slave labor. You don't have that in the United States.
The Great Wall of China is 13,000 miles long.
Well, people -- I don't know, I don't think people really care how beautiful the door is. It's not their home, but the money could come from, though, the money they bring into their home, meaning taxes. Who pays for this?
Well, the...
Mexico has already said that it's a ridiculous idea. The former president of Mexico yesterday said there's no way, this is a silly idea. Who pays for this?
Well, it's silly for Mexico, yes, because Mexico...
But who pays for it?
I'll tell you who's going to pay for it, Mexico's going to pay for it and it is silly for Mexico. You know why?
How do you enforce this? I mean, you name, for example, New Hampshire, but there are states like Texas, for example, and you're in the hotel, restaurant business. You and I both know a great number of businesses have been behind the backs for many, many years hiring undocumented workers.
Yes.
Some of those very businesses that you know, being a hotel owner, a restaurant owner, etcetera.
And that's OK, they come in legally through visas.
That's a different dynamic.
No, they come in legally through visas, they have work visas.
I'm told that we have to go...
... and we're going to stop that.
... and I'm getting this wrap for some reason. We were hoping that you could stay longer, but I do want to talk to you, going back to the comments that you made at this rally last night, but when you were in Iowa, you were holding your Bible, two Corinthians and all, the Bible given to you by your mother.
By the way, in Europe and different places, they do say two Corinthians, you do know that.
I hear your staff is going crazy that you have to go, but I would love to talk to you a little bit later about the economy...
I would love it.
... the improved job numbers, some of the jobs that have added, and what you would do.
I would love that.
So, hopefully we'll get you back.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Come back tomorrow and tell your staff to calm down.
OK.
Congratulations. The early polling from Dixville Notch, 170 miles from here, you wound up with two votes.
OK.
But Kasich had three and Bernie had four.
But they spent a lot of time up there, I didn't.
So.
That's how I look at it.
Well, you can tell there a number of people who like you because they're offering up their front yards as a place to put your signs.
There's a lot of signs out there, that's true.
I believe you said even if your wife leaves you, even if you're in the hospital, vote.
I said no matter what. In front of a lot of people last night, I said, if you're sick, if the doctor says you're not going to make it, if your wife tells you she's leaving you, she's fallen in love with another man, it doesn't make any difference. Go out and vote, right? So it's a little different.
So the other campaigns are saying you need to win by 30 points for it to be a real win.
Yeah, I know. Of course they're saying that. You know, what? If I win by one point, I'm very happy, OK? I just want to win. I just want to win.
Do you know what that meant?
No. It wasn't overly bad. And I have to tell you the woman shouted, she shouted it out. I said, OK, I'm going to do it. It was like a retweet.
Right.
So I would never say a word like that. So I just -- I just gave it...
You were quoting her.
By the way, I can tell you what? The audience went crazy. Standing ovation, 5,000 people went nuts. They loved it. You know, we're having fun. And that's what I mean about being politically correct. Every once in a while you can have a little fun, don't you think?
Has she called you sexist since?
No. And in fact, they don't even mentioned my name. That was a very tough evening they had, believe me.
What about what Madeleine Albright said a couple of days ago out on the stump, that there's a special place in hell for women who don't support...
I thought that was so disgusting. I thought that was a disgusting -- I've never been a big fan of hers to start off with. I thought that was one of the most disgusting statements the way she said that. So she should be ashamed of herself and she should apologize.
So you're not going to say that men have an obligation to vote for you?
Can you imagine if I said that? But can you imagine if I said what Madeleine Albright -- it would be like. And with her...
That men should be ashamed if they don't vote for you?
Well, you can almost say that. Yeah, wouldn't that be interesting? Let's think about that one right? We might get away with it.
What do you want?
Just tell me, who are you voting for? See?
She said she's voting for America! Make it two eggs over tremendous, OK?
I love her. And she's seen everybody come in. They've all seen Sue. But she just -- I walked in and she said, Mr. Trump, I'm voting for you.
All right.
That's why I asked the question. Do you think I would have asked that question if I didn't?
Unbelievable. All right. Thank you Mr. Trump. Good to see you.
Thank you very much.
Donald, nice to see you and thank you for joining us.
Hello, Greta.
Well, Donald, last night, it was a whopping victory, 20 points in New Hampshire. It's more fun to win, isn't it?
I love winning. It was a great win. It was a great victory. We love it.
Why do you think that on the Democratic side of the aisle that Hillary Clinton got -- she got clobbered by Bernie Sanders, 22 points over there.
Yes it was surprising to see. And, you know, we are dealing with a socialist, perhaps even a communist. I listen to his speech last night. That was beyond socialism. So I don't know what's going on over there. That was a pretty big victory for him.
Governor Chris Christie, you spoke last night. You had a long conversation. I assume that he congratulated you on your victory. What else did he tell you?
Well, I just spoke to him a little while ago, again. And he spoke to me last night. And, you know, he's a friend of mine. He's a good guy? He is a tough cookie.
OK.
Yes.
All right. Another question -- another --
Who's going to pay 95 percent tax? You literally would have to pay 95 percent tax to pay what this guy wants to do. I mean, he wants to take everything away from one group. But the truth is, once you get the taxes beyond a certain point, he is unelectable.
We're just -- today, Carly Fiorina suspended her campaign. I don't know if you know that yet. But any thoughts about Carly's suspending hers?
Well, I thought she was very nice. I thought she was very effective in a lot of different ways. I didn't know she suspended, but, you know, you have to do what you have to do. And we will see what happens with Chris, likewise.
Donald Trump, thank you very much for joining us. I hope you will come back soon.
I will, thank you.
Is that what croaked Rubio?
Say it again, Chris.
OK. I now have to pronounce you something you may not like. I now pronounce you, sir, a politician.
Oh, I don't like that. I don't like that.
But the good part is you're a winning politician. No, no, you're in the business now, sir. You're inside that game. Thank you for calling me so late tonight. Congratulations, really, on a personal level.
Thank you, thank you very much, Chris. I greatly appreciate it. Great honor. Thank you.
I'm joined on the phone right now by the winner of the New Hampshire Republican primary won Mr. Donald J. Trump, Mr. Trump congratulations on your victory. Did you ever think this was going to happen?
Well, it's been a really wonderful evening, Jake. And, you know, I thought it might, but I didn't know by these numbers. And I was so happy. I just looked at your report and it was right across the board with men, with women, young and old, with, you know everything. And to win every single category was perhaps the greatest honor of all.
And it looks like obviously the voting results are still coming in, but it looks like this is the biggest victory in a Republican primary since George W. Bush lost to John McCain in New Hampshire 16 years ago. How does it feel?
Well, I didn't know that number. That's a long time that's a great feeling to know it's been that big of a victory. But that's a lot of years. But I will tell you, it's just an honor to have won. As, you know, I told you if I win by one vote, I'll be happy. But this makes me even happier. I will say that, Jake.
As you may know, South Carolina, they like their politics a little more rough and tumble. Are you ready for what may come your way, the negative attacks, and perhaps even dirty tricks that might happen in the Palmetto State?
Well, we've already had dirty tricks in this campaign. So, you know, I'm ready for whatever they want to throw at me and that's fine. I mean, we've had a lot of dirty tricks in this campaign. But, you know, I want to congratulate everybody that's run. They're all very capable people and it was an honor to run against them. Now I'll see them in a little while like I'll be tomorrow, I'll be around 1:00 or 12:00 tomorrow, I'll be in South Carolina getting ready. And that should be interesting. I love South Carolina. Having the people are -- I've been there many, many times and the people are tremendous people and I think I can do very well there.
There's a big competition obviously for second place and third place in New Hampshire right now. Who do you think is your competition going forward, is it Ted Cruz, do you see some rejuvenation for Jeb Bush and John Kasich, who are you focused on?
I see them all, Jake. I really see them all. I think, you know, they're all good competitors and talented people. And, you know, right now it looks like Kasich has a little bit of a lead, but the other one -- I'm just looking at your chart. Yep, it's getting a little closer. It's going to be a close race I think. And you sort of predicted that, and so did CNN and all groups. It looks like it's going to be a close race for second.
Lastly, you've been campaigning more with your family, your wife Melania, and your boys Don and Eric. How are they taking the news? This is a big, big night in Trump family history.
Well, they're very proud. Melania, standing with me right now, and Don, and Eric and Ivanka. Corey is right outside, who has done a terrific job. In fact, he just walked in now, so I will comment on his ground game which was excellent. But it's been an amazing period of time. And we're all thrilled and we want to make America great again. It's very simple. We're going to make America great again.
Well, congratulations on a very, very strong win in New Hampshire. Best of luck to you. We'll see you out there on the campaign trail, Mr. Trump.
Thank you very much, Jake. You take care of yourself. Thank you.
So Donald what happened last night? The numbers are staggering. I've got Steve Kornacki here who said you just swept through the entire state. You won every region. You won every county. What happened?
Well, I've had a great relationship with the people of New Hampshire. We'd go around and you get to see it yourself. You were at one event. But every event we had we were packed. We had hundreds and hundreds of people, sometimes thousands of people outside on small venues. I mean, you'd have a small venue that holds 200 people, it would have 3,000, 4,000 people standing outside. So that's not a bad sign. And we would just -- it was really absolutely amazing. It was amazing the love that was in the state of New Hampshire. They're great people up there. I know them -- long before the politics thing I've known them.
Donald, it's Willie. Good morning and congratulations.
Hi, Willie.
You are obviously the story here, you and Bernie Sanders. That's a historic win last night. Beneath your storyline, though, some people talking about John Kasich surprisingly coming up and finishing in second place with a good showing for him. We haven't heard you talk much about John Kasich in this race. As you move forward, what are your impressions of him? What do you think about him?
Well, I like him a lot, I think he's a nice guy. Unfortunately, going to the airport two days ago I heard a commercial and the commercial was a little bit negative and I said I wonder who did that commercial. It was a negative commercial of me and it was John Kasich. So maybe I'm not in love with him as much as I was prior to hearing the commercial. It was a false commercial. I thought it would be somebody else but it wasn't, it was John. So perhaps we have to take a little tougher stance than I would have normally. I was surprised to hear it. He talked about he's not going negative but he did a negative commercial on me so I didn't like that.
Do you think he's been a good governor of Ohio, Donald?
Well, I think he hit oil, that's what I think. What happened is he got a little bit lucky but he also let them go after it, you know, unlike other governors where they didn't let him go after it. They were there fracking in Ohio. They hit oil in primetime when the prices were at a high and that makes up for a lot of sins. It makes up for a lot of errors and difficulties. So I think that was a very positive thing for John. And I give John credit. You know, a lot of people don't let him go frack and he said go frack and frankly, that made a huge difference for Ohio.
So who's your biggest threat now moving forward? Now we've gotten through Iowa, we've gotten through New Hampshire. As you assess the Republican field, who's the biggest threat to you?
Honestly, Willie, I think they all are. They're all smart, intelligent, very accomplished people. I wouldn't necessarily pick one. John is a little bit closer than the others, but that could be an outlier also. You never know what's going to happen. I was very happy with our polls numbers because -- You're right, about -- I was listening to before you -- you know, the polling was just about exactly right. We had the polling at 34, 35, 32, probably the result was even a little bit higher than the polling. But I think they're all really potential threats, but I'm OK at handling threats.
Would you keep it or fix it, Obamacare?
I'd rather get rid of it and have a beautiful new plan and concept. I would much rather repeal it and replace it. It's very complex. Keeping it and doing a patchwork job, I don't like. We should come out of the box with something great and I think we'll get great support from Congress and I do that. I mean, I know all of these people, I know all of the players and they want to see it, too, so I think we'll do it.
Mr. Trump, good morning. What would --
Hi, Bob.
Let's learn a little bit about your skills as a politician. Tell me, have you reached out to Governor Christie in the last 12 hours? And if not -- if so, what was that conversation like? And if not, are you going to reach out, try to get his endorsement, try to rally some establishment support behind you?
Well, you know, I never thought of myself as a politician, but Jeb Bush said he's a highly gifted politician, he is a gifted, gifted politician. And I said I am? I didn't know that. So sort of interesting. And actually sort of nice. I think that Chris did an amazing job in terms of the debate as a prosecutor and he's a friend of mine and he actually called me last night and we had a long talk and he's a little disappointed because he really did do a great job, he did an amazing job during that debate. I was witness to it because I was standing next to Marco -- who I like very much -- and, you know, it was a strange kind of a situation going on there. It was a little bit strange and Marco understands that and he'll be able to fix it, I hope.
Well, Donald Trump, congratulations. How's your family holding up at this point watching all this?
Everyone's great. It was great seeing you, and you guys have been supporters and I really appreciate it. And not necessarily supporters, but at least believers. You said there's some potential there. And the same thing with Bob. Bob has been a real professional, whereas other people were looking and saying wait a minute, he's very successful as a developer and a business guy, but he's not a politician and Bob got an early glance and I appreciate Bob's fair reporting in The Washington Post  very much so.
But let me clarify what supporters mean. This is kind of important. Because from the get-go -- I mean, I don't agree -- Donald and I have not agreed on things ever since we started talking about pageants on MORNING JOE, so it's not like Donald and I have the same world view. You guys might in some ways. But we knew that he could do this from the get-go. So I think the sense is that we believed that his talents actually could follow through and translate into something while everyone else underestimated him.
Well, Mika -- Hey, Joe, I just want to say, I watched you two with some of your guests who are so angry that they could not breathe on your show. The anger was incredible. The lack of anything -- I've never seen anything like it, actually. In fact you were upset because you said how can you have guests like this? Whether it was good, bad or indifferent. But I watched that and I thought it was amazing. And I just wonder where those people are today and hopefully someday they'll be allowed back on your show.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Known you more than 30 years. You've always said you're a winner. Last night was the first time that voters went into the polls and officially made you a winner. How does it feel?
It feels great. The people are fantastic from New Hampshire. I mean, I've had a bonding relationship with them for a long time. I've been up there long before the political thing. And I said I was going to do well there and we did, I guess, even better than anticipated. But would have rallies where, you know, ten times the number of people would show up than -- than we expected. We got to see it from an early point. I think South Carolina, frankly, is going to be very similar to that.
New Hampshire definitely shook up the rest of the race and kind of reordered things. Who do you see as your biggest competition now? Is it Kasich? Is it Cruz in South Carolina?
I -- I -- yeah. It's a great question, but I think all of them. I mean, they're all accomplished people. They're governors and senators. They're all very good people. Maybe, you know. But I think, probably, I wouldn't want to pick one because they're close enough, and we'll see what happens. But they're all accomplished people.
It's serious now, Mr. Trump. I mean, now people are going to take a good, hard look at you and say, can he be the leader of the free world? Can he be our president?
They've been looking at me, Matt, for six months.
OK. But now...
This isn't just...
Now this New Hampshire win, though says OK, this guy is on track. When it comes to parents in this country, they want their kids to be able to look up to the president. They want to be able to admire the president. You were on with us last week and we talked to you about being more subdued. You said, I'm trying to become more statesmanlike, more subdued. This week, you continued using some words, repeating a word that a supporter said to you at an event that I'm not going to repeat here. Is that statesmanlike?
Well, you know, we had a massive rally, 5,000 people in a snowstorm -- in a blizzard, and everybody was having a good time. And a woman, not a man, a woman shouted out this word, and then shouted it out again.
But you didn't have to repeat it.
But we had a good time and it wasn't the worst thing in the world.
But how...
You know, the problem with the country...
Is it political correctness or is it just good manners, temperament, demeanor?
Well, I don't think so. No. I don't think -- it wasn't the worst thing in the world. We all had a good time. And remember this, it was a woman and it was a repeat. It wasn't me. In fact, I said you should never say that word. You should never say that word...
And then sarcastically repeated the word.
Of course. And then, did I reprimand the woman? I said...
You can't reprimand someone if you're going to be willing to say the word...
No, no, no. I said...
.... yourself.
I said you are hereby reprimanded. This way, I figured I'd save myself from the press.
Real quickly, when are you going to release your tax returns?
Probably over the next few months. They're being worked on now.
What's the hold up?
They're very -- well, they're very big tax returns. The biggest -- I guarantee you this, the biggest ever in the history of what we're doing. So it's very complicated stuff. But we'll be releasing that.
Will people be surprised at the rate that you pay,?
I think they'll be surprised...
Lower or higher than expected?
... at how little I pay. You know, they're going to be surprised at how little I pay. I fight like hell not to pay a lot of tax. And you know, what? Every politician probably does. I watched others where they say, I want to pay taxes. I fight like hell not to pay taxes. I hate the way the government spends my money.
Thank you for being here.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Donald, let me ask you this. On the cover of the Union Leader here in New Hampshire this morning, there's a picture and it shows you and Bernie Sanders as the big winners. Famously, the publisher of the Union Leader said, " Donald Trump has -- " in an op-ed, "Donald Trump has no business being in this race, " and they endorsed Chris Christie.
Right.
Of course, ultimately, you would like to be the nominee...
Right.
Mr. Trump, thank you so much for your time. And again, congratulations on your big win, taking 35 percent of the vote in New Hampshire. We'll see you in South Carolina.
OK. Thank you very much.
Donald Trump on the phone with us right now. Donald, good to have you. Congratulations.
Thank you, Neil.
Did you imagine this day?
Well, you know, I like to win in life. I've done very well in life. I win. Who would know I would by this kind of a number so early because I've been leading in all the polls, but, you know? We're doing very well, and I hope we continue. It's all about we make America great again. A very simple message, and a very concise message.
... That's not even journalism though, I mean, I said it the other day. When people agree or disagree with you is one thing...
... It's a disgrace, it's a disgrace.
... It's a disgrace...
... He's a low-life. I know him from a long time, but he's a low-life. And, you know, to do a thing like that would be -- is a disgrace. You have no idea the heat that they're taking. You know he tried to sell the newspaper, and there were no bidders. Zero. I mean, not even for a dollar they wouldn't buy it, it's a loser. But, you still have to put up, it sits on a newsstand, and maybe a couple of people buy if it it's got my picture on it. But, it's sort of a -- I think it's a pretty bad thing to do.
... Now, to be fair he has had jobs in the in the...
... No, no, he had jobs after he was a governor, and you know how he got to be governor. After he was governor he got a job for a company I know very well. He's a great guy. He gave him a job for all the wrong reasons. He didn't get a job because of other things.
...
... percent, and he's a lot higher than that. I thought he'd be a lot higher than that also.
... Remember everything, you heard everything perfectly at the Fox Business debates...
... Yes you did, honestly. You did. That's true. One hundred percent.
... What about Ted Cruz? Would you consider him?
Well, he's a smart guy. He's certainly a smart guy, but you know? I don't want to get into that now because I don't want to be -- I just don't want to be talking about it now.
All right, real quickly, this video that came out from Iran today showing these sailors. Remember the ones who were captured a couple of weeks back? Some of them crying...
... Oh, that's disgusting...
Well, as you know, we've already seen Michael Bloomberg is considering a run, tweeting out more pictures of himself with world leaders like Cameron, British Prime Minister Cameron. Others, I'm sure, to follow. But, he seems to be itching to make the move, and commit the move. You said you welcome him, he's a friend, but do you fear that your fellow billionaires could divide that vote?
No, I hope he runs. I mean, I'd love to compete against Michael Bloomberg. I hope he runs, and if he runs, it's not going to be easy for him, that I can tell you.
Who do you think he takes votes more away from?
I think he might hurt the Democrats more, you know? He wants to take everybody's gun away, he's totally pro-choice, he's got a lot of things that really form right into the Democrat line. I would love to see Michael run, but I think it's not going to be very easy for him to be honest with you.
Donald Trump, congratulations again. Polls look good. South Carolina, and some of these Southern states, I think your people has a pretty good ground game there?
We have a good ground game. We proved that this weekend. I mean, we have the best ground game of anybody, and we won by numbers that were even higher than the polls. The polls were saying 32, and we won by 36, and that's a lot. That's a lot. We have a good ground game. We have a great team.
They're certainly jazzed, they're certainly compassionate. Donald Trump, thank you very, very much.
Thank you very much, Neil. You take care of yourself.
Yes. So that could happen to you on Saturday, it could happen to anybody.
No it's not going to happen to me.
Couldn't happen to you.
But a lot of things -- a lot of things will. I hope not. Hey, Bill, a lot of things can happen.
Yes. But I am evil. I mean evil applies to me.
That's right.
But Hillary Clinton --
I get along with everybody. Bill, when I was in business.
I'm curious about this. Inept I could see. You saying her tenure as Secretary of State really wasn't good for the country. That's more of an ineptitude, evil is evil is somebody.
Ok. It's inept. I could have used inept.
You don't really think she is evil though? You don't think Mrs. Clinton is evil?
Well, let's just keep it in abeyance. Let's see what happens.
Do you believe that Bernie Sanders thinks that he can get the stuff that he says through congress? Because I gave you a hard time about immigration -- you are never going to be able to deport 12 million people, that's impossible. And I told you that
Yes, I will.
No you won't.
All right. Ok, we'll see.
But we'll go back to that.
Time will tell.
Do you think that Bernie Sanders believes what he says that he is going to run up another.
No.
$19 trillion dollar debt and nothing is going to happen?
No.
Why?
Look, he was a very ineffective senator for years. I mean he hasn't done anything as a senator. All of a sudden he is going to totally change the country around? I don't think so. No, I don't think he believes he can get this through congress. I don't think he even thinks he has a chance. But I think it sounds great for an election for his purposes.
So you think it's a vanity run? You think it's a vanity run.
No. I think that he does not believe he can get it through congress. You would have to ask him that question. He does not believe he can get it through congress. I fully believe that.
Were you invited to the Sharpton/Bernie Sanders breakfast in Harlem today? Did they ask you to come?
I'm devastated. I'm devastated that I was not invited. I would have loved to have been there.
So you are going to say to them.
It's going to be $505 billion this year.
If you continue to devalue your currency -- I'm going to slap a tariff on all Chinese goods coming into the United States. Ok. They then are going to say to you --
Bill, yes.
President Trump, we are going to sell all of our bonds that we are holding for America's debt. We're going to flood the market with them and crash your currency.
That's all right.
That's what a trade war would do.
Now, they are not -- no, no, no. They wouldn't crash -- they won't crash our currency. They will crash their economy. That's what they are going to do if they start playing that.
All right. It's going to be bloody.
They will crash their economy. You will have -- let me explain something. We're too dependent on China. We're too dependent. They will have a depression, the likes of which you have never seen if they ever did that. That's what would happen, Bill.
Ok.
I mean you know what people don't understand in our dealings with China, we have the cards. They don't have the cards.
They are.
-- excuse me -- Bill, if they're here illegally they may or may not be. Just like the argument we had about the anchor babies.
I'm telling you --
In my opinion you don't need --
-- all settled law says once you're here you are entitled to our constitutional protections, every single case. All right. Just so you know.
I disagree, ok? I disagree. That doesn't mean I wouldn't do that. That doesn't mean I wouldn't do it.
They will block you.
If they are here illegally, I disagree with you.
They'll block it. The federal courts will block it.
They're here illegally Bill.
Look, Obama just got blocked.
They are here illegally.
It doesn't matter. They are entitled to constitutional protections. Obama just got blocked on a, his illegal immigration amnesty and b, in telling the coal companies that you can't have a certain amount of emissions. He got blocked on both of them.
You and I had an argument not so long ago about the anchor babies where somebody comes, has the baby here and they're forever going to be taken care of.
Yes. And that's law.
And everybody said you need a new constitutional amendment to end that. They turned out to be wrong. I turned out to be right. You just need an act of Congress. You don't need a new constitutional amendment. And we had the same discussion.
You change the law but not retroactively. You can change it but not retroactively.
Ok. So, Bill, what you're saying would mean that if somebody just walked across the border, just walked across and they are here for a couple days and border patrol catches them, they can't bring them back, we have to go through a whole long process because you are not right about that.
They can catch them the act of crossing -- if they catch them in the act of crossing, they can repatriate right away. If they're here and established, they get the due process. All right. One more thing.
I disagree.
What would you do?
That's a real problem.
What would you do?
There is another problem. In Colorado, the book isn't written on it yet, but there is a lot of difficulty in terms of illness and what's going on with the brain and the mind and what it's doing. So, you know, it's coming out probably over the next year or so. It's going to come out.
What would do you to stop it? What would you do?
I would really want to think about that one, Bill. Because in some ways I think it's good and in other ways it's bad. I do want to see what the medical effects are. I have to see what the medical effects are and, by the way -- medical marijuana, medical? I'm in favor of it a hundred percent. But what you are talking about, perhaps not. It's causing a lot of problems out there.
But you know the medical marijuana thing is a ruse that I have a headache and I need, you know, two pounds of marijuana.
But I know people that have serious problems and they did that they really -- it really does help them.
Ok. All right. Was that fun? Fun interview? Another one? Fun? You like the show better than anyone, right?
It's always a pleasure after one hour sleep coming in from New Hampshire to be on your show. Always a great honor.
But you still can. You can still can, even though you don't have any sleep. I don't know how that happens.
That's good. I don't know, maybe it's --
Mr. Trump, thank you very much for joining us. We appreciate it, sir.
Very good. My honor.
You want to give us your analysis of why the stock market's selling off and there's turmoil all around the world?
Because we've let China take over our economy, as you've been hearing me say for a long time. We are very, very vulnerable. We are no longer controlling our own destiny. We are the big sphere of other countries all over the world that control us and they're manipulators. They have a tremendous power over manipulation of their currencies, and we are into that web and even though we're not manipulators because we're not smart enough to be manipulators, believe me, our leaders are not smart enough, we are nevertheless in the manipulation business because of the fact that some of the great money changers of all time are people that were wedded with them. And China would be number one. Japan is doing a tremendous number on us now. You know, Japan is backed from the standpoint, obviously doing a very good job. Their currency devaluations have been very serious. When they do that, it affects us.
What are we doing wrong here? You're saying it's China, Japan, maybe Mexico that's hurting us -- what are we doing ourselves?
Mexico, by the way, is killing us. What we're doing here -- well, do you have about two days? I can tell you everything. You know what, Stuart, that could be one of the longest answers I'll have to give to anyone. We may need longer than your program.
You on for 30 second sound bites. Give me a 30 second sound bite.
When you start with the fact that we're allowing other countries to take our businesses out of this country, if you look at the businesses that we've lost, it's vast. It's countries. We have lost countries. We've lost millions and millions of jobs and the jobs we have now are not good jobs. I saw you reporting on the jobs numbers, which are phony numbers because they were put out by politicians in order to look good, but they don't talk about the people that can't find jobs, which are the people that are unemployed. That's called unemployment.
You told Bill O'Reilly the you think the unemployment rate is 25 percent. I've not seen that anyplace else.
Actually, I've even seen some higher than that -- if you add up all of the people that have looked for jobs and cannot find them and now have given up looking, you're talking about unemployment rate that could be as high as 25 percent. It's incredible. Now, you know what I'm saying. When you are looking for a job, you're unemployed. When you give up looking for a job, you are considered statistically employed. So when they say -- we have tens of millions of those people and the other thing we have is we have very bad jobs, and you reported on that. In other words, we have an unemployment rate of 5 percent according to the phony numbers. I call them the political unemployment rate is 5 percent. But they're very bad jobs. They're low paying jobs, they're not good jobs. We used to have real jobs. Now we don't have them. So many of our -- when I was in New Hampshire where we had a very great experience, frankly -- when I look at these old factories and some of them are empty but some of them are converted to senior citizen housing and things like that -- and senior citizen housing is wonderful but it's not a job producing thing. It's not a factory that's producing 5,000 jobs within the walls of the factory.
What would you do about it, though, apart from opposing China or Japan and Mexico?
Well you have to bring the jobs back here. One of the things we're going to do about is lower taxes. The United States is the highest taxed country in the world, essentially. Right there. But it's the highest taxed country in the world. Businesses are leaving the United States, corporate inversions. The United States, right now, is going to lose tremendous numbers of companies. You saw where Pfizer just announced. You saw where other large, respected companies are announcing and have just announced. Pfizer's moving to Ireland because they get lower taxes and other reasons and they want to get their money back. You know, there's a lot of money outside of the United States that these companies can't bring back. It's their money, they can't bring the money back. And because they can't bring it back, some companies aren't even leaving for taxes. They're leaving to get their money, if you can believe it. There are vast sums of money -- they say $2.5 trillion, I think it is 5 trillion --
And you could bring that back by lowering the corporate tax rate and lowering the tax rate on individuals.
Or even lowering the rate just on the money coming back. For instance, now they have to pay a massive amount. People say 35, 36 percent. If you lowered it to 10 percent, it would come back into the country. But they don't do it.
What kind of growth rate do you think we could get if you did what you're saying we should do?
I really believe we could be at the 4 percent growth level. If China has 6 percent or 7 percent growth, it's like they're in a depression. We have no growth. Our last quarter, we had no growth, essentially. We had a tiny little bit. But we had essentially growth. We have no growth. Our country's not growing.
Our viewers are watching you right after the New Hampshire election result. You're looking good. You won hands down. When you wake up on the day after, do you ever think about what it would be like to walk into the oval office as the president? Do you think in those terms?
I don't think too much about that. I have to get the job done. I'm somebody who likes to get the job done before I start thinking about it. And I have a long way to go. We started off with 17, I guess Carly left and Chris Christie left yesterday, as I understand it, so that's two less. And we're getting down to a very manageable number. I think Rubio's been hurt very badly. That was a bad hit. And we're going to see what happens. Bush is a stiff, I don't see how he can win. The last thing we need is another Bush. This guy's total stiff.
How about Mike Bloomberg?
I hope he runs.
He kind of took a shot at you the other day. He said, he should get in the race because the public deserves better. I think that was a kind of shot against you.
Yes, well he did say that, and he was a friend of mine. As far as I'm concerned, he's not a friend of mine anymore, because he did say something to that effect. And all he is seeing is -- because I thought that was a nasty shot. I assume it was taken at me. I like to have my friends -- but when my friends say things like that, assuming it was meant to me, I no longer consider them friends. I knew Michael very well. And he was a friend of mine.
Would you like him in the race?
I would love him in the race. I would love to compete against Michael.
Because you think he'd take votes away from the Democrats?
Well, I think I'd beat him and I think he would hurt the Democrats, yes.
Can I get your fast reaction to a couple of developments here? Pope Francis is going to stand at the border with Mexico, standing with the migrants. What do you make of that?
So, I think that the pope is a very political person. I think he doesn't understand the problems our country has. I don't think he understands the danger of the open border that we have with Mexico and I think Mexico got him to do it because Mexico wants to keep the border just the way it is because they're making a fortune and we're losing.
What do you make of -- you said that you approve of Vladimir Putin of Russia, going ahead and bombing in Syria and in Iraq. While he's done that, now you've got a new huge wave of migrants making their way to Turkey and then maybe to Europe. By backing what Putin's doing, you have actually supported a big jump in the number of migrants leaving North Africa. What do you say to that?
Well I'm not backing anything that Putin's doing. Putin was very complementary of me and people were asking me. What I want Putin to do is bomb ISIS. I mean the one thing I want Putin to do is bomb ISIS. Everything else is secondary. And he is bombing ISIS. I'd like to see him bomb ISIS more than he's bombing them. But we could have some help in knocking out ISIS, because we do need to knock out ISIS.
You've said that Kim Jong-Un of North Korea, you'd make him disappear. Do you want to elaborate on that?
Well, China should make him disappear because China has total control, even though they don't admit that, they do, they're just toying with us as they always do, China has total control over North Korea. They wouldn't be eating if it wasn't for China. And China has a lot of power over him and China should make him disappear. That should be a China problem, not a U.S. problem. You know, we're like the policemen of the world. With that being said, something has to be done because you can't give that maniac missiles.
Last one, Janet Yellen, chair of the Federal Reserve, is going to be testifying again today on Capitol Hill. Do you think that any part of this financial turmoil worldwide is her faulth?
Well, sometimes it's confidence. Perhaps people don't have confidence in her. You don't know what it is, exactly, but it is turmoil. I'm very proud to say I never bought stocks. But a number of years ago I bought a tremendous amount of stocks and I sold them a year ago. I'm very proud. At first, I said, oh, I made a mistake. I saw my stocks and the market look up. Now, I can tell you I'm way, way ahead. So I'm very proud of that. I'm not a stock buyer. In other words, I listen to your program but not for stock advice. Because money was so readily available, it almost was -- every company should make a fortune, and I was right, and then I sold -- I held them for a couple of years and then I sold them and did really well with them. And again, it's not my thing, but I saw this coming. And I've been talking about a bubble. I think you sort of alluded to it but I've been talking about a bubble. We are, right now, in a big, fat, ugly bubble and we're controlled largely by Asia and by countries like China, in particular, China, because of its vast size, and we're controlled largely, our destiny is largely tied into what is happening in China because we're so wired into China. And they manipulate their currency and we don't and that gives them a big advantage.
You know, I find it amazing. I watched on primary night. I'm flipping the dials. I'm watching all these idiots that get paid for their commentary and they don't seem to really know a thing about politic. And the narrative was, Oh, Donald Trump doesn't give specifics. And I'm, like, Well, I've asked you very specific questions. For example, you have said to me you want to balance the budget. You think the penny plan, for example, is a good model.
I do. I do.
You know, it's -- so why are people not hearing that? You said you like health care savings accounts.
The health care savings accounts.
You would also like America -- you would like America to be energy-independent quickly so we don't buy oil from countries that hate us.
Absolutely. Absolutely. No, I want to open it up. I want to -- look, as far as I'm concerned...
Your campaign announced today you're only going to run positive ads in South Carolina. Here's my question. If they start bombarding you with tens of millions of dollars in negative ads, are you going to stick to that, or is it open-ended?
No, I'd like to run -- I'd like to run positive, but if they start hitting me with, you know, negative ads, I'm going to go negative. I have no choice. I have to.
All right, let's go through issues really quick here. You believe we have to balance our budget, right?
Yes. Absolutely.
And you want to do it quickly, expeditiously.
Ideally, yes, as quickly as we can without hurting a lot of people, but as quickly as we can within reason.
All right...
I mean, I've heard people say over the next 25 years.
That's nuts.
People that we're running against I've heard say over 25 years. It's ridiculous. No, we're going to get the -- it's going to be balanced fairly soon.
All right. And you support 2nd Amendment rights, right to carry, right for people to protect themselves in their home and workplace, correct?
100 percent.
OK.
The strongest. There's nobody on the stage -- and you can speak to the NRA about this, including my two sons, who you know very well -- I mean, they're members of the NRA. So am I, by the way. But there's nobody stronger on the 2nd Amendment anywhere than I am.
And you not only will repeal Obamacare, but your interest is in competition and health care savings accounts.
Absolutely. Or we can do something else. But the health care savings accounts are -- you know, I think it's one very good idea. I do like, though -- we have to get rid of the lines between states so there can be competition, Sean.
And as it relates to terror, we know you're going to build the wall. Also, you're going to make sure we can vet anybody coming in from a country where there might be terror ties in that country.
Well, and I've said it, and you know, nobody else wants to say it, but I've said it. We have to stop the Muslims from coming in for a period of time until we find out what is going on. I mean, there's something wrong.
And with ISIS, you're going to take their money by taking the oil and the land that they have taken back after Americans fought, bled and died there.
Yes, but I said to do this four years ago, Sean. I said on your show -- I mean, for four years, I've been saying this, take the oil. Now they're so rich, it will take a while for it to catch up. But take the oil. We have people don't want to hit the oil because it's going to create pollution. I mean, it's hard to believe. At first, I thought they were kidding...
All right, here's a -- last question in this segment...
... but they don't want to hit the oil because of the pollution. Yes?
Looking at the current makeup of the Supreme Court -- our next president may appoint two or three, maybe four justices. Pick two people on the Supreme Court that you think would be a good model for the type of person you're looking for.
Well, I like Scalia and I like -- I tell you what, Justice Thomas -- he has been a great stalwart. He's a -- you know, I've met him on numerous times, and I just think he's been an absolute stalwart.
Yes, he really has been. I agree with you. All right, we're going to take a break. I got some questions...
And doesn't get enough -- and by the way, doesn't get enough credit. He does not get enough credit.
Let me ask you a question...
It's, like, one of my best places in the country.
Yes, but you do these things a lot and...
... I don't really need the credit.
Understood. OK, how well do you have to do South Carolina, and what do you predict you'll do?
Well, I don't know. I mean, the same question -- in fact, you asked me the identical question a few days before...
It won't last long.
... believers to a certain extent.
It won't last.
But they are becoming much warmer.
You outperformed...
... Including big with women, big with men. What?
You outperformed the polls, one. And number two...
Yes, we outperformed. Yes.
All right...
... we did when. But when we came to New Hampshire, we had some ground game. We beat everybody.
All right, Mr. Trump, thank you, as always. Appreciate your time.
Thank you very much.
Impeaching him?
Absolutely, for the war, for the war.
Mr. Trump, thanks very much for your time this morning.
OK, thank you very much.
You mentioned that the World Trade Center came down during George W. Bush's presidency.
Right. Absolutely right.
George W. Bush is a pretty popular guy in South Carolina. When you say that he lied, as you did, and you said that weapons weren't there, I mean, the intelligence...
Excuse me. There were no weapons of mass destruction.
Seems like a race to the bottom to me. Tell me...
No, it's terrible. I think it's terrible. But I didn't say it. He did.
You won New Hampshire.
I did.
Your tax returns, when are we going to see them?
I would say, over the next three, four months. We're working on them very hard. And they will be very good.
Finally, the veterans money that you raised, what is the status of that?
Well, we have given away a lot of it. And much of it is given away. Most of it is in themail.
Well, joining me now is the first of four Republican presidential candidates who are on with us this morning. It's Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, welcome back to MEET THE PRESS.
Good morning.
Let me ask you first on the Supreme Court opening. Do you have a litmus test? Do you have a litmus test on Roe v. Wade? Do you have a litmus test on Citizens United when it comes to deciding who you might appoint to the Supreme Court should you become president?
Well, I think we have some great people out there. Diane Sykes from Wisconsin from what everybody tells me would be outstanding. We need a conservative person. I think that certainly we have some great people. We lost one of the greats. I'd like to have the person tailored to be just like Justice Scalia. Justice Scalia was truly a great judge and respected by all -- both sides.
All right. I want to move on to the debate last night.
By the way which is hard to find.
Let me pause you there.
Chuck, it took --
Well, let me ask you this. In South Carolina as you know, George W. Bush is popular among Republicans. You are -- this is a risky strategy. You called him a liar last night about WMD and you essentially said you would have been ok --
I didn't call him a liar. I didn't call anybody a liar.
Well, you called Ted Cruz a liar.
Chuck, I said maybe there were lies because, look, the weapons of mass destruction they said they existed and they didn't exist. Now, it was his group that said there are weapons of mass destruction. That's why we went in. That's why so many people got hoodwinked into going into Iraq. Then they go in there, they searched high and dry. They looked all over. There were no weapons of mass destruction. Turned out that there were absolutely not -- there were no weapons of mass destruction. Now, was it a lie? I don't know. Who knows?
Mr. Trump, I have to leave it there. Little short on time this morning -- I look forward to speaking with you again soon, I hope. Thanks for coming on and stay safe on the trail.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Mr. Trump, I want to ask you about one more thing you said. You said of DACA which grants undocumented immigrants who enter the country before their 16th birthday and before June 2007 to receive a renewable two-year work permit and exemption from deportation. You said, quote, "I think it's great". That would be seem against your immigration policy.
I didn't say that. Wait, wait, wait. I never heard that question. I never said that.
OK. So no support, to be clear, what amounts in effect to a worker -- visitor worker program?
I mean, Jim, you're putting the question up that I don't even -- I just left the press conference. I didn't hear that. It must have been a different question that you heard.
Donald Trump, thanks for taking the time. We appreciate the time to talk to you.
Thank you very much. Bye.
I see. I see. So, in other words, that's why you think that there were some boos there for a little while, and the standing ovation.
That's the only reason.
Wow.
And I'm laughing at them, because I get it. I understand it.
Yeah.
So, I said, "Don't go into Iraq, you're going to destabilize the Middle East."
Yeah.
And you know, these guys all have their finger on the button, it's ridiculous.
I know you -- I know you are.
But I was against going in. But then I was against pulling out all of the troops. Because I said, wait a minute. It's going to totally destabilize things first.
Yes.
We would have been -- and we could have rebuilt our country because our roads are falling apart. Everything is falling apart -- our outbreaks, our road, our bridges, our tunnels. The country is falling apart because we are spending all this money in the Middle East.
Which is why I ask you about infrastructure.
We've got to -- we have to knock out ISIS and knock them out strong. You know, we play this politically correct thing. We have to knock out ISIS and knock them out quickly and viciously. We have to get rid of them.
Yes. Donald, thank you so much for joining us. We are going to be watching you in South Carolina. My friend, we'll this see you soon. Thank you, sir.
Thank you very much, Maria. Bye.
let's talk about what experts are calling you potty mouth. I can think of off the top of my heads, three things that you have said on air that this is true, CBS will not let me repeat or they would have to bleep them. How are you going to stop?
Well, it's easy, I have decided to stop -- I mean, I do that for emphasis and I do that sometimes nonpolitically. And when I -- once I decided to run for office I sort of said, well, we're going to have to stop.
But you didn't stop.
We'll lose the crowd.
You're down in South Carolina. I'm from South Carolina. I want to help you out here. Let's hear you say, "Please vote for me, y'all".
Well, I can say that. Please vote for me, y'all.
Your message is getting across. Mr. Trump, we're going to let you go. I know you have to take off. So sir, thanks very much. Safe travels and we'll see you tonight with Joe and Mika.
Thank you very much, Thomas. So long.
Donald has this weird pattern. When you point to his own record, he screams, "Liar, liar, liar."
This guy will say anything. This guy lied about Ben Carson when he took votes away from Ben Carson in Iowa.
Building a hotel overseas is not foreign policy.
Every guy that attacked me so far, they've all gone done. We've got to keep it that way, right?
Good to have you.
I thought I did great in that debate. I actually thought I had a great...
A meltdown.
I thought -- nah, I thought it was good. I mean, I was being hit from every side. It was tough. I mean, I was -- you said I was too tough, but I thought I had to be tough. I thought I did well.
Let's start with this question. Now that as we said this morning on the show, if you look at a lot of the polls, a lot of people are starting to say you could be the Republican nominee. So we need to step back and ask a lot of questions...
OK.
Right.
And I said, oh good. That's good, because now I can do it, also. It's just perfect.
Are things closing in here in South Carolina?
Well, I think most of these polls were taken after the debate, and they worked out good for me. And it was taken after the debate. I have never done well in the Wall Street Journal poll. I think somebody at Wall Street Journal doesn't like me, but I never do well with the Wall Street Journal poll. So I don't know. They do these small samples, and I don't know exactly what it represents. But I am really honored by those poll results. Those are great poll results overall.
But your opponents would say, though, you haven't always been pro-life.
No, that's true, and so was Ronald Reagan likewise, so...
Right. So what happened? When did that change come?
It changed years ago. And what happened is I saw things with people and people that I know and people that I respect that made me change. Ronald Reagan changed. If you look at Reagan...
Right.
You know, he said he evolved. He used that expression.
Right.
Ronald Reagan actually used to be a fairly liberal Democrat, and he began a fairly conservative conservative. I mean, fairly. But he became a great president.
But Ted Cruz says, we can't count on Donald Trump in the future, especially in picking Supreme Court justices...
Well...
... if he's changed in the past. So how do you convince...
I'm the only one -- by the way, during the debate...
How do you convince a Republican like me...
That's fine.
... that if you were nominated...
Good.
So let me stop you there. The second amendment, very important in this state. Heller, the decision that the Supreme Court passed that -- or decided on actually found out that the Second Amendment -- ruled that the Second Amendment went -- meant what a lot of people have long believed that it meant, that Americans have a right to keep and bear arms.
Right.
Will you make upholding the Heller decision a litmus test in Supreme Court nominees...
Yes, I would...
... that you send?
Yes, I would. And I talk about it all the time.
So you -- so you won't nominate...
Absolutely...
... somebody to the Supreme Court unless they agree with Scalia on the Heller decision...
Correct...
... that the second amendment means Americans...
Correct...
... have the right to keep and bear arms?
I give that commitment right now, absolutely. And I've been very strong. I'm a member of the NRA. My sons, Don and Eric, are members of the NRA for a long time. They're hunters. They're great members of the NRA.
So we're going to get deeper into your policy positions coming up.
OK.
So you're going to repeal Obamacare?
He lied about -- repeal and replace. Absolutely.
What do you replace it with?
Health care savings plans, one way. We have to get rid of the lines between states. I do tremendous health care. I have so many employees. I have thousands of employees. I've employed tens of thousands of people. I built an unbelievable business. And one thing that has come out, when I filed the documents with the FEC in terms of my business...
Right.
... I built an unbelievable business. So I have tremendous numbers of people...
So let's clarify...
Joe, we have to get rid of the lines. We have artificial lines.
Right. So you're talking about letting people shop from one state to another...
We have to.
No, no, no, but I'm asking -- but that's just what I'm asking you. Just like you've guaranteed -- what you've guaranteed on the Second Amendment. This has been a fight within the Republican Party and what it means to be conservative.
Sure. Sure.
Right.
And we'll work out either through Medicare, which we'll save, or something. We will work out a plan where instead of having people dying in the streets -- and I say to the Republicans all the time. And by the way, I get standing ovations from Republicans, from Republican groups. I got one yesterday. I said we can't let people die in the streets. We got to work out a deal with the hospital or with somebody in that community, where if somebody is sick, and really sick, and they don't have housing, and they don't have...
Right.
... all -- we can't let them die. We're going to take care of them.
So all Americans will get health care of some sort...
We're going to take care of them. We have to take care of them. Now, that's not single-payer. That's not anything. That's just human decency. And I'll tell you what. Every single time I say that, I say to people in the audience -- I say, "So what do you think?" They all stand up and give me a standing ovation, OK?
Hi, Mr. Trump.
Hello, Barbara.
So should we force Germany and Japan to start carrying their load, build up their own military, and start funding their own defense, instead of the United States?
Well, at a minimum -- Joe, at a minimum, I think it's fine what we're doing, but they have to at least pay us for it. They have to pay us so we don't lose tremendous amounts of money. We have...
If you go in and fight, have the country -- our country lead the war against ISIS...
Right.
Right.
... and we have the madman right next to him, and we have 28,000 soldiers on the line, we're going to have to do something.
I've got to ask you -- I know we've got to go to the studio audience. I wish we had three hours, we don't, so I'm going -- I've got to dig into a couple of things you've said here really quickly.
OK, go ahead.
First of all, you talk about the $19 trillion national debt. If I listen to the people I've been listening to for years on these issues, they tell me that your policies would add another $10 trillion, $11 trillion to the national debt.
They're wrong. I mean, they're wrong.
How are they wrong?
All I'm saying is, my policies, I'm going to reduce taxes, OK? And the taxes is going to bring jobs back, and we're going to bring jobs back into the country, big league, and we're going to have a dynamic economy again. You know last quarter...
But are you going to cut spending, too?
Joe, we had no growth. Joe, we had no growth.
Are you going to cut spending?
I'm going to cut spending. We're going to cut spending big league. I mean, you look at some...
Where is that?
So many -- Department of Education. We're going to cut Department of Education. We spend more money per pupil than any country in the world by far, and we're ranked number 30 in the world. You have all of these countries, whether it's...
Bless you.
Oh, I thought she was a -- she sneezed.
You're so used to protestors, somebody sneezed, and you're ready to throw them out.
No, I immediately said the camera's going to go over there and show what a big crowd I have. That's the only way to show a big crowd. That was a healthy sneeze. She's a healthy person.
OK.
Now, these candidates -- I self-fund, I'm going to do it. These candidates are all controlled by the drug companies, the lumber companies. They're never going to do that. They're never going to do it.
Really quickly -- and I know I've got to go to the audience, but entitlement reform, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid...
Right.
... combined.
Right.
... are going to consume every dime that goes to Washington, D.C.
Waste, fraud and abuse.
Well, that's not going to take care of it by itself.
It's a huge number. It's a huge number. Waste, fraud -- you know people have paid...
What about raising the retirement age?
Hey, Joe, I'm not going to...
People are living older than they ever have.
I'm not doing it. Let me just say. Waste, fraud and abuse is massive in Social Security and Medicaid.
All right.
Now, I'm not doing it for that reason. I'm just saying this. We don't have to do it. We're going to make our economy strong; we're going to make our economy rich. And we're not going to have to do it.
Let...
That's a big -- that's a big problem.
It is a big problem. Let's talk about China, though, for a second. You've talked before about slapping tariffs, 40 percent, 45 percent on China, if that's what it took, but wouldn't...
It's not actually what I said. The New York Times said I said that, but honestly, I was at a meeting with the New York Times. I didn't say that.
OK.
I said it is a threat that I would use against China.
OK, but...
For instance, China can solve the North Korea...
So they're pulling me to break. I want to ask you something, though, because before we go to break...
We can't let China continue to get away with what they're doing to our country.
So are you talking about with China -- whether we're talking about tariffs -- are you talking about more threats than action?
It's a threat. No, no, it's a threat, but you have to be able to put it in place. What China has done to us with devaluation of their currency is unbelievable. And nobody thought they were going to do it again, and then four months ago they had the largest devaluation that they've had in 20 years. The largest in 20 years. Now they're going to do it again. Our companies can't compete. They are devaluing their currencies. Our company can't compete.
Hi, Mr. Trump.
Hello, Barbara.
Hi, Mr. Trump.
Hi, Stephanie.
Thank you for being here.
Thank you.
But you whispered it, Donald.
I never whispered it.
Let's talk, though, about civility, though, towards other people...
OK.
.... because you like hammering other people. As a politician, I always had a rule, you couldn't be at war with more than one person at a time. Your rule seems to be you have to be at war with at least a dozen people at a time. What happens if you're president of the United States and...
Changes.
Are you going to have friends on the Hill?
Yeah. I started out -- I was one of 17 people, and we're not including the Democrats. It was coming at me from every which way. I was very strong and very bold, and I hit a lot of people. I knocked out Lindsey Graham. I knocked out Perry. I knocked out a lot of people, Walker, we knocked out a lot of people...
You're still hammering people.
And now I have to, because I still have six left.
Do you have the temperament?
The problem -- I have a great temperament.
Jeb Bush would disagree.
Jeb Bush -- look...
Lindsey Graham would disagree.
Jeb is a sad case, OK? It's sad.
There you go again.
I'm not saying anything -- I'm just saying it's a very sad thing. I said he's a low-energy person. Look, people...
It's not what I want. It's not what she wants.
Our country is not winning.
The question is, do you have the temperament...
Yes. Yes.
... to deal day in and day out with 535 people...
I think I have a great temperament.
Finger on the button.
Finger on the button, OK, finger on the button.
But you're going to get hit by world leaders.
They were asking, your brother was told to do this and this by Donald Trump, and they have to respond. I was being hit by everybody. Finger on the button. I'm the one, the only one that said don't go into Iraq. So don't tell me about finger on the button. I want to build our military so strong, so powerful that nobody's going to mess with us.
So what does that mean? Is that more money, too?
No, it's more money, but it's cheap compared to what we're doing right now. Nobody respects us right now. They don't respect us...
All right.
Nobody's going to mess.
Is it insulting...
Well, I'll tell you...
There are some similarities.
We're different in one primary -- I'll tell you, there's one thing that we've very similar in. He knows that our country is being ripped off big league, big league, on trade. The problem is, he can't do anything about it, he's not going to be able to do, whereas I'm going to do things.
Why not?
Because he doesn't understand it. I mean, he doesn't understand what's happening. But he does know that China and these other countries are ripping us off -- Mexico. You see Carrier moving down, they're moving down to Mexico. Nabisco is moving. The whole thing is crazy, what's going on with Mexico. He does understand that, much more so than many people, but he'll never be able to do anything about it.
Do you think -- do you think she'll be indicted?
I think maybe she will, but I think if she isn't indicted, the only reason is because the Democrats are protecting her. She is being protected 100 percent. Because you look at General Petraeus, you look at all the other people that did a fraction of what she did...
Would you ever consider -- speaking of General Petraeus, would you ever consider General Petraeus possibly as a vice presidential candidate if you won the nomination?
We can't, now. He's been so badly hurt.
Donald, you have said you're going to build a beautiful wall and Mexico is going to pay for it.
Right. Right.
But you never say how.
It's so easy.
You say believe me, they are.
It's so easy.
Believe me is not an answer. How?
Believe me. Let me tell you. Believe me.
How are you going to make Mexico pay...
Can I tell you? Can I tell you? You have to stop, and I'll tell you.
How do you get Mexico to pay for it?
Very simple. You have five different ways. Number one -- here's the key. They are making, right -- if you look at it a company -- $58 billion. The wall is a -- a year. We have a trade deficit with Mexico of $58 billion. All I have to do is start playing with that trade deficit, and believe me, they're going to pay for the wall. You watch.
OK.
... because I always wanted to run against a socialist in this country. I can't imagine it. But I think he'd be easier to beat.
Hi. Hi, Mr. Trump. I was just -- I'm a college student, so education is really important to me. And I was just wondering, since there's so much going on right now in the rest of the campaign, I was just wondering how you are going to -- what -- like, what are your thoughts on Bernie's higher education plan and how he's going to reduce the cost --
The problem with Bernie -- thank you. That's a very good question. The problem with Bernie's plan is everyone's going to pay 95 percent taxes. I mean, you know, you have that and you have all the other things that he wants to do, and you're going to have...
So then let's talk about the cost then.
... you're going to have a tax rate of 95 percent.
So how do we reduce the costs for colleges? It's insane, the inflation rate...
You're right.
... for higher education is...
You know why?
OK. We've got -- we've got Hiral now...
Good question. Thank you.
Hello, Mr. Trump.
Hi.
My question for you is, why did you decide to run for president?
My theme is make America great again. I want to make America great again.
Why?
I want to make it strong -- because I love the country. I didn't need this, Joe. Believe me, I have a wonderful life, I have a wonderful company, I have a wonderful family...
Thank you, Donald.
Thank you.
Now I want to turn to Mr. Donald J. Trump. Mr. Trump, thank you for joining us.
Hi Steve, how you doing?
I'm doing good, sir.
So what was Jessica, was she positive or negative? I was, I just got in on the last check in of the conversation
I think I did I I think she I think she was not I think she was not a supporter she was saying how you're persuasive and you're persuading lot of people but I think she was calling you know she was questioning some things, particularly your religiosity and your adherence -- but listen that's a great thing about the show, we got --
Then I'm glad then I'm glad I didn't hear the conversation.
Why do you think that is?
Because I'm, you know I'm a Christian, I'm a Protestant, I'm Presbyterian and I'm not a liar like Cruz. Cruz lies, I've never seen any human being lie like this guy lies. Even Rubio called him a liar yesterday and politicians don't do that to each other --
Mr. Trump, I want to get on another topic, I don't want to but however, you've been in New York real estate in global real estate and the gaming industry and with politicians that's a -- you can't say reasonably that Ted Cruz is the biggest liar you've ever seen given the environment you've had to come out I've seen some guys you had to do deals with globally and it --
That's right, you don't want to you don't want to deal with them. Let me tell you, I've seen I've dealt with much tougher than him, he seemed like a baby by comparison, but he's the biggest liar. Ok let's get onto another subject.
Ok I wanna ok listen --
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
No, you don't you don't now you can't make me un -- I want to get on to something that I think is more meaningful substance. Number one, ok let's talk about this, your the basis of your philosophy where you're pointing the American people: we're gonna protect the American sovereignty, we're gonna build a wall and make Mexico pay for it, China -- we're gonna get 10 million jobs back from China and and we're gonna temporarily halt immigration from Muslim dominated countries until we sort out exactly what's going on in the country, who's coming in and who's coming out those three things ok --
Those are among three things --
That's three basically but you look around the horn, yesterday at the border two million people, open-air mass, you had actually called out the Pope, about a week ago saying hey, you know the Pope is very political, I understand he's the Vicar of Christ and heads the Catholic Church, but he's very political and he's gotten involved in this border situation and he's really arguing Mexico's side, he doesn't understand the issues. Yesterday -- and by the way the Vatican came back against you by name, one of the Vatican spokesman, which we're looking up, I don't think has happened since Henry the Eighth, so it's like six hundred years.
Great honor.
Yesterday at the border he had a mass, and in his homily, we've got our lead story up on it, he really put the blame for this issue -- now he did some symbolic stuff about praying across the border, etcetera -- but he put the blame on this issue principally on Mexico. Do you believe that the Pope blinked because you brought up the fact that hey, please do not get involved in American domestic politics here, this is very complicated. Do you think the Pope blinked and really really took your side and argued that it was a it was Mexico's -- Mexico's making a lot of money, this is a Mexican problem they're forcing on the United States?
Well that I don't know but I put it out there because I heard the Pope and I respect the Pope and I love the Pope in many ways. I love you know what he stands for and I like his attitude. He's very independent, he's very different, and sort of a modern-day Pope if you think about it. But I put it out there because he was going to be at the border and I said well you don't know -- I mean because he'd made statements about sort of me I guess or whatever and I put out a very strong statement that you know you gotta take a look at the border, what's happening: there's tremendous crime, there's drugs pouring through the border, it's not coming from us, it's coming from the other side. And I made a pretty strong argument that I talked about the wall very quickly and it got picked up. And and he could have been persuaded, I mean I don't know, but I really respect the fact that he sees both sides, you know a lot of people are inflexible, they won't change and I saw that he came out and he is, hey look, Mexico could stop the drugs in two minutes. Mexico could stop illegal immigration in two minutes. You know, you can't get into Mexico. You wanna become a citizen of Mexico you can't get in. Mexico, Steve, could stop illegal immigration -- we wouldn't even have to build a wall, if they wanted to, if they wanted to do it. And by the way if I win, they're going to start stopping it also, beyond the wall. We're gonna build the wall anyway, but they're gonna start stopping it. Because they could stop it. But they say "Oh, come on through!" It's like they're a railroad station. But if you want to make a left turn and go into Mexico you don't have a chance, you don't even have a chance. But when you want to go through to the United States, Mexico says "Welcome, welcome." And probably by the way some of their bad ones, their bad dudes, they say "Get the hell outta here." You know, why should they put 'em in jail for the next 30 years? "Let's give 'em to the United States." Steve, we have a hundred and seventy nine thousand criminal illegal immigrants in our company, criminal -- these are people convicted of crimes. Some of them very serious crimes -- a hundred and seventy nine thousand of them. They're coming through the border. So look, I know what I'm doing, and the people understand, and you know that phony Wall Street Journal poll that came out yesterday which was in my opinion was a fix, you want to know the truth. CBS just came out with a poll that says the same as every other poll. You know Wall Street Journal came out with a poll cause I'm not a big fan of Rupert Murdoch.
That's a Rupert Murdoch that's a Rupert Murdoch-controlled Wall Street Journal, is it not, sir?
Well, it was a Rupert Murdoch hit. It was just a Rupert Murdoch hit --
You believe that's a Rupert Murdoch hit on you?
Well I, something's wrong. Because look, every single poll, every single poll that has come out nationally -- and locally, by the way, you see locally and I mean we're doing fantastically well, right? South Carolina, we're doing fantastically well. But every single poll that has come out over the last, you know long time have us near 15, 20 points nationally. All of a sudden out of nowhere the Wall Street Journal poll comes out and I'm essentially even but I'm down two points to Cruz of all people. Cruz can't get elected dog catcher. So I'm down two points to Cruz. So now what happens, Steve? They put it on the front page of the Wall Street Journal. When I was leading big last month in the Wall Street Journal --
It was back in the tire section. It's back in the tire section, right?
You couldn't even find it.
It was in, no, I saw it, I saw it, it was back in the tire ads. They had tire ads back --
I'm telling you, I never found it. I could not find it.
Hold on, let me ask you, hold on, hang on. Rupert Murdoch, Fox News, New York Post, Wall Street Journal, is his U.S. media arms; he's got also the Times London --
They treat me very badly, that whole group treats me badly --
You think that's cause Rupert Murdoch's got, you think Rupert Murdoch's trying to do a hit on you?
I have no idea why. I don't care why, but they treat me very badly. I mean you know it's obviously not having too much of an impact. Look the Wall Street Journal poll was a phony poll. It was a dishonest poll, in my opinion. It was a phony poll. And even somebody at NBC said this poll can't be right. They did -- it was a small sample size, but it was a very conservative -- and it was and people, people at NBC News were embarrassed by it, ok. But the Wall Street Journal poll -- I don't --
By the way you talk about your new super -- that's your new super PAC the Morning Joe show, right? You're talking about your super PAC told you that? That --
No that's the Morning Joe show, but they treat me fairly at least. I mean they treat me fairly, it's a good show, they treat me fairly. And CNN treats me fairly! The worst, the worst treatment I get is from Fox, ok? Between Karl Rove who's a moron, between you know Krauthammer who you know he can't say anything good no matter what. I mean I when I won in New Hampshire --
How can they treat you badly, you have a very strong personal relationship with Roger Ailes, how can that happen?
Well I don't know. Roger Ailes and I like each other but he doesn't do anything for me, that I can tell you. He certainly doesn't do anything. In one way he's very professional, he won't lift his finger to help me.
Let me let me --
Roger Ailes will not lift his finger to help me. Which is fine, I mean he's a professional and maybe that's the way he's supposed to do it. But I get treated I get treated very --
Do you think they're over the top with Rubio, Rubio support? Do you get a sense that they're biased towards Rubio?
They're in love with Rubio -- why I have no idea, but they are in love with Rubio.
Is Nikky Haley -- are Nikki Haley and Marco Rubio gonna become the Ken and Barbie now of Fox News, you gonna see em nonstop 24/7 since she endorsed him?
Well I I don't know but they are in love with Rubio and it's amazing to me and after he cratered in the debate they protected him. And Megyn Kelly is you know she's just you know very biased. And I look at it and I just I just look at it and in my opinion I get treated the worst by far by Fox. And I do like Roger, he's a friend of mine, but he's a friend of mine that won't do anything for me.
Let let let let me pivot back to Mexico --
So I don't know how -- I don't know if that's called a friend.
Many of our people that come to the site, in the comments section people that call say "Look, I like what Trump says I -- but I don't know if he's going to back it up." Would you commit, if you win the nomination, win the presidency, let's talk about the Mexican border. Would you commit to actually go down and spend significant time in the Rio Grande Valley, in Texas, Arizona, other places where this wall has to be built, to show the American people you're serious about that?
For sure I would but I've already been there. I've been there twice, I've been there three times. I mean I, I don't have to spend the rest of my life there, I understand it. I can look you know I'm a great real estate guy, I've made a fortune in real estate. I can look at it and by the way we are going to need a little eminent domain to get that wall built just so you understand you know you need eminent domain. You have to pick certain areas, OK? Hate to tell you. But we're going to have that wall built and it's going to be a great wall and it's going to be a wall that works and it's going to have a door in it because we want people to come through, you understand, but they have to come through legally, Steve.
Let me ask you on China: China every number coming out of China, I don't know what you can believe what you can't believe, but one thing's certain, they're walking down their GDP that they're showing to the world. The country's highly leveraged, big problems internally as this as it starts to unwind. All the the the bailout from 2008 to 2016 has really been demand from China since the the banks are still zombies. Do you believe that China is now -- where they're putting surface-to-air missiles in these islands and now they're building these artificial islands which are really just aircraft carriers in the South China Sea -- do you believe they're trying to be provocative to the United States, because they're trying to they're trying to take the eye of Chinese domestic -- people in China off the domestic problems particularly as their economy starts to collapse, just try to focus on foreign interest and foreign powers they gotta stand up to?
Well I also think they want to scare us a little bit, because guys like me, I've been saying it for a long time, but people are starting to realize how China's just ripped us off. It's the greatest theft in the history of mankind what China's done to the United States because of stupid politicians. It's the greatest theft in the history of mankind and they see now that the United States is wise to it because of my campaign and I think that they're probably being provocative militarily so that we don't do the things that we have to do on trade.
Is South China Sea a vital -- ambassador John Bolton was on here 15 mins ago said it's a vital national security interest, the free flow of the Pacific Fleet in goods from the Straits of Malacca to Korea, Japan, Philippines, the United States is a national is a central national security interest to the United States. Do you believe that?
I agree with that, but we have to be reimbursed for the money. We cannot continue to police the rest of the world including Asia so that South Korea can have free trade and so that other people can have all this free trade and so they can get rich and that we have our ships all over the place and we have our planes flying and spending billions and billions of dollars. These are wealthy countries, they have to reimburse us for our costs.
Last last question about Apple. Apple, this whole situation about the encryption about the phone from the terrorist, I know you made a big issue about the terrorists about him getting in here. Where do you stand on this whole Apple issue and do you believe your rise of this interest in nationalism that your campaign and obviously Santorum and others brought up has gotten Apple in a tough situation, whether their loyalty is to the United States of America or to some global you know capital markets?
Apple is wrong and we should go in and get that thing and we have to find out what's on those phones, and Apple is one hundred percent wrong, they should break into the phone.
Last question with Israel, you -- the headline is that you're gonna look at both sides and be even handed. Your answer on this situation with Israel and Palestine was actually more subtle, I believe. You said you know so many tough negotiators that -- people, private citizens that have been engaged there that haven't been able to move the football. One point you wanted to make was that you don't intend to turn your face cards over all the time and show everybody. What would you mean by this response?
Was that not covered that way in the papers? Did they not show --
It is, but I think I think people are jumping on the headline that you're going to not pick sides or you know I think they're going for the gray -- the answer was more subtle and a lot of times you don't have subtle answers. This was quite subtle. What did you mean by it?
My answer is this. If I'm supposed to be a mediator or an arbitrator I don't want to go out and say you know this one's wrong that one's wrong I want to say let me see what happens. Now I what I really said was that this is perhaps the greatest jigsaw puzzle in the world, the toughest puzzle to solve anywhere in the world. If you could solve this pu -- because I've been told by great people and great negotiators, this is not a solvable problem.
People you admire that have been engaged in this, correct?
Great negotiators, talented, I'm telling you that these are great negotiators, they say it's not solvable because the hatred is so intense it's an impossible problem to solve. I would like to try and solve it, but I can't solve it if I'm gonna start you know saying the various things that they ask me to say. So what I want and what I tell you is it's a very tough setting. It's probably -- you know when you talk about deals? This is probably the toughest deal to do, because the hatred is so ingrained. But nevertheless and what I said and I said that, but nevertheless I will try and solve it.
Last thing Mr Trump, you know people are saying -- the callers and people and think that when you get and when you start talking about these issues people lean forward, they wanna hear the answers, they they they they they either like what they hear or they they know at least where you're going, your thinking's going, but when it gets to these personal attacks it's turning people off. On this Ted Cruz situation, you've dealt with the toughest hombres in the world. You can't expect us to believe that Ted Cruz is the biggest liar you've ever met. It's just not it doesn't it doesn't stand to reason. He may be a guy you disagree with, it may be he's put up some --
Yeah, he's right up there, let me tell you. He's right up there. He'll say things that are just totally wrong. Well Rubio said the same thing, I mean Rubio came out two days ago, he said "he's a liar I've never dealt with a guy like this." You have to set the record straight. At least I can set the record straight, because I have you know I have people like you that take my calls. But the fact is at least I can set the record straight. But no no he's he is he's right up there in terms -- not by any means the toughest person, because I've dealt with some very bad hombres, but he is somebody that does not tell the truth.
Mr. Trump, thank you so much, I know you're incredibly busy.
Ok, thank you very much, thank you, Steve.
Welcome. How's it going? Nice to see you.
Hello, Anderson. Nice to see you.
Let's start right there.
A little surprise.
But people do come and go through the Vatican, and it's open to tour.
And they're gonna come and go through the wall. I mean -- you know, but they're gonna come and go legally. They're gonna do it legally. And that's what I want, and that's what a lot of people want, obviously, because they agree with me.
You could -- you're doing well in the polls. You could pick up a couple votes tonight.
Well, that's a maybe, actually.
Would you like to meet with him and talk to him about it?
I'll do it any time he wants. I mean, I think it would be very interesting. No, I like him. I mean, I like him as a personality, I like what he represents and I certainly have great respect for the position.
I -- I -- as you know, we did a town hall last night. I talked to Marco Rubio, talked to Senator Cruz. You sent Senator Cruz a cease and desist letter to the campaign about an ad they're running that features an old interview you did with Tim Russert back in the late '90s...
Long time ago.
Yeah, you -- when you were...
Many, many years ago.
... when you were pro-choice. You are now -- say your position has completely changed...
I'm pro-life.
... you are pro-life, and you're adamant about that. But...
But that's not the only thing. I mean, look -- he has a problem with the truth. And even Marco Rubio -- I guess today there was something about he was -- you know, picture was manufactured, and it was not perfectly...
Do...
A problem for the party, for the Republican Party.
I want you to meet some of the voters. Sherry Burris is here. She's Republican who says she's currently undecided.
Oh, that's too bad.
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Thank you.
Good evening, Mr. Trump. My question's about health care and I'm a local health insurance agent over in Canvas, South Carolina. And I'm not a big fan of Obamacare.
You're right.
Yes. You've gone on record as stating that -- many times that you're -- one of your first acts of duty when you're elected president would be to abolish Obamacare.
Right. A hundred percent.
Let me ask -- just to follow-up...
You understand what I mean. There's no competition.
I got one question about it. If Obamacare's...
Thank you...
First of all, hello, good to see you again.
Hello, Orrin. Nice to see you.
I think it's about five years ago I sat in your office and you said you were thinking about running for president then, and you didn't run then. But man, are you running...
I should have done it. We would have had Obama for four years instead of for eight years. Right?
... right, right. Well, man, are you running now.
I am running. I am running.
... right, and you've made a lot of statements about a lot of issues. You've covered a lot of ground in...
Right.
... in a very short period of time. One statement you made, I'm really having trouble getting over, frankly...
OK.
... and I wanted to ask you about it.
Sure.
As a matter of fact, when I was watching the debate, and you made this statement, I had to apologize to my children for the words that came out of my mouth when you said what you said. And that was -- and I don't want to put words in your mouth, so correct me if I'm wrong...
Go ahead. Sure.
I don't -- I don't believe that. I'm just wondering, given some time passing -- perhaps you've rethought that. Would you be willing to rethink that?
Well, a lot of people agree with what I said. And I'm not talking about lying, I'm not talking about not lying. Nobody really knows why we went into Iraq. The Iraqis did not knock down -- it was not Saddam Hussein that knocked down the World Trade Center, OK? That's...
What was -- just -- what you said was, "they lied, they said there were weapons of mass destruction, and there were none, and they knew there were none. There were no weapons of mass destruction."
Well, there are a lot of people that think that. There are a lot of people that think -- look, bottom line, there were no weapons of mass destruction. They said, "there are weapons of mass destruction." I was against the war when it started.
I'm trying to separate -- yeah.
Let me tell you, do I know?
Just to his question -- one more chance. Either -- you believe he either lied or did not lie. Are you willing to say which?
I don't know what he did. I just know it was a terrible mistake.
So, was it a mistake for you to say in that debate that you thought he lied?
I'd have to see the exact words. Look, I don't know. I would probably say that something was going on. I don't know why he went in. I don't know why he went in. Because honestly, there was no reason to go in. They didn't knock down the World Trade Center. It wasn't Iraq that knocked it down.
You would not say again that George W. Bush lied.
I don't know. I can't tell you. I'd have to look at some documents.
You talked about Carl Icahn already.
Yeah, but I don't necessarily -- you know, Carl's a very successful businessman. What I'd really love Carl to do is check out how are we doing in trade with China, pal.
You want him to negotiate.
I'd like him negotiating.
Would you want all Republicans in your cabinet? Or would you want a cabinet of...
No, not necessarily. I want the best people. Honestly, I want the greatest negotiators. We can't lose $505 billion next year with China.
But does that...
But by the time the war started -- that was quite a bit before the war started.
Yeah, this was 2002.
By the time the war started, I was against the war. And there are articles -- I mean, there are headlines in 2003, 2004 that I was totally against the war. And actually, a couple of people in your world in terms of the pundits, said, you know, there's definite proof in 2003, 2004 Trump was against it.
But 2004, the Reuters article, which you pointed to a lot, and there were a couple of comments you made, I think, at a Vanity Fair party and one other comment. Those were, I think, a couple of weeks after the war began.
Which is OK. A lot of people said -- you know, it was so early that even if it was a little bit after the war, I mean, he was totally against the war. I was very much against it. That was probably the first time I was ever even asked about the war. Howard, who's a great guy, by the way. A lot of people don't understand that. But he is --
He's a great interviewer.
He's a great -- he's a great interview. He's a very talented guy and a good. But that was probably the first time -- I don't remember that, but it was probably the first time I was asked about it.
OK. I haven't heard it, but you may have said that.
And, you know, when you're in -- when you're in the private sector -- yeah, I may have. When you're in the private sector, you know, you get asked things and, you know, you're not a politician and probably the first time I was asked. By the time the war started, I was against it. And shortly thereafter, I was really against it.
I want you to meet another voter. Ryan Parsons is his name. He's an aspiring entrepreneur here in South Carolina.
Hi Ryan.
Hey Mr. Trump. It's an honor to speak to you.
Thank you. Me too.
Good evening, Mr. Trump. Welcome to the capital of southern hospitality.
Thank you.
You had said she would be great and she would be -- she would be fantastic.
She's very smart.
Come on, wait -- wait a minute.
No, it's true.
I gotta call you on that. What?
It's true.
Right. In fact...
... because it's a conflict of interest.
... and just -- I want to read the quote, just so we -- we're -- have it on the record. You said, "I think she'd be phenomenal. I think she'd be one of the best, but frankly, we'd have to rule that out." So you never actually were proposing it. So just for the record.
Yeah. It's a -- and I don't think she'd want to do it either.
I understand you like -- you were a big fast-food guy as well -- that you actually bring fast food to your plane sometimes.
I do, sometimes. And -- and frankly...
How much do you sleep?
And -- and by the way -- about three to four hours a night.
That's all you need?
It's all I need, luckily. I mean...
A lot of people --
Will he be Trump?
Will he beat you? Are you concerned about that?
He's no Trump, right?
He was an airline pilot.
My brother Fred. He was -- he was a very talented flyer of planes, it was -- I mean, great pilots would go to him to study. I mean, it was a real ability he had. But the alcohol was -- I mean, it taught me a tremendous lesson, and he taught me a tremendous -- he was really very --
And you have the biggest crowds.
I have the biggest crowds.
All right I want to get back to the horse race in a minute. Let me go to the main attack line that is being used against you.
OK.
You're not a conservative.
OK. Well, I am a conservative.
Let me go to the heart...
We have the world's worst trade deals, by the way, just so you know.
So then why the attacks about, Well, he used to be? Is it -- is it just because...
Well, they say that, but...
Right.
And you know that. I've been -- I've been on your show...
Do you -- so you're going to build a wall. That's conservative. Can you balance a budget? Do you believe it's possible?
Oh, absolutely.
You know, $20 trillion in debt.
Very quickly. I even like your penny plan. You know, I'm a very sophisticated guy. I went to the best business school in the world and all of that stuff. I like your penny plan. I mean -- and you can do more than a penny.
Waste, fraud and abuse.
Or you could do it quicker. You know, some of these politicians think you can't balance the budget. Some of them think it's going to take 25 years. You've had them on your show, where they say, We think over a 25-year period, we can get the budget -- and you know that's not going to happen.
We always get the promise that we're going to get lower spending and higher taxes. You get the taxes, you don't get the spending. You get amnesty, you never get the wall. So you...
Sean, I've seen politicians on your show that you are for and they're getting ready to go to Washington for the first time. And they're going to get rid of Obamacare, they're going to do this and that, all these things that you have to do. They're going to balance the budget...
Doesn't happen.
A year later, you have them on your show, they haven't done anything.
Yes.
They talk.
I saw the knees buckling. I saw the same thing.
I saw it for the first time.
Yes.
In other words, a day goes by, all of a sudden -- I'm telling you, these people need a strong leader.
Yes.
These people are weak.
... important to you. You want to eliminate baseline budgeting. Cut...
Absolutely. Yes.
... waste, fraud and abuse.
Right.
How important is lowering taxes for economic growth?
Very important. I have my policy, and I have the biggest tax cut there is of all of them. We have a tax cut for the middle class. We have a tax cut for business. Our business, our middle class -- we're paying the highest taxes in the world, Sean. We are paying in this country the highest taxes in the world. So I have big tax cuts for the middle class. You know, we've forgotten about -- the country has forgotten about the middle class.
It's shrinking.
No, no, they built our country, OK?
Repatriated money, trillions of...
Corporate inversion. I mean, you look what's going on with corporations, where Pfizer is leaving this country. How about where a Chinese company is buying the Chicago Stock Exchange, OK?
Well, you what happened with the Carrier workers.
Carrier is leaving. They're going to Mexico.
Into Mexico.
And I know how to stop that.
I've asked you at least three, four times about your replacement for Obamacare. And for some reason, the press never picks up on your answer.
Well, I talk health care savings. You know, you look at health care...
Health care savings accounts.
You look at -- you look at getting rid of the lines. I've been talking to you about that a lot. You have to get rid of the lines.
In other words, buying across state lines.
Absolutely! There's no competition. And you know why? Because all of the politicians that you have on your show all the time are paid off by the insurance companies. That's all. It's very simple -- meaning campaign contributions. As much as you like them, they get campaign contributions...
They don't get any money.
But they were on your show.
Yes.
And the truth is they get tremendous campaign contributions from the insurance companies. They're making a fortune. Obama got taken care of by the insurance companies. Obamacare  is a windfall for many insurance companies.
Well, it's also forcing young people to buy plans they don't need...
Oh, it's sad.
... and with a health care savings accounts, you can get a high deductible, catastrophic care, and you pay four times less.
It's great. But you have to get rid of the lines so you have competition also.
And can take it portability job to job.
Portability is very important.
All right, what about -- you said education. You would take the entire Department of Education and take the money that we're spending federally on education and give that money to cities and states?
Give it to the states. Absolutely. And to have -- look -- and they can do it with real love and with heart. You got to bring education -- if we were doing well on education, I'd say, Fine. We're ranked number 30 in the world. You have China, Denmark, Sweden, Norway -- these countries are all the best countries, right?
Your two favorite justices on the court now?
Well, Scalia was one. And I'll tell you something. I think a man who's so underrated and he's so solid is Justice Thomas.
I agree with you.
He doesn't get enough credit. He's been a rock just about more than any of them.
Did you ever read his book "My Grandfather's Son"?
I've seen the book. I have not read the book.
Really good book.
I'll look at it.
All right, you talk about...
Do you agree with that?
Yes. I think...
He doesn't -- he doesn't get enough credit.
Very different personality than Scalia. Scalia jokes, has a lot of...
Like the opposite.
... comments...
Like the opposite.
... you know, biting dissents and opinions...
But he's been a rock.
Because it's such a mess.
Tough issue. The Palestinians and the Israelis don't exactly -- they're not exactly meshing.
Yes.
And you know, one of the reasons that I said it last night -- the toughest single deal to make is getting them together. And I've been told by some Israelis that no matter who it is, you'll never do it. I'm going to give it a shot, but I will say it is probably of all the deals, right...
You did mention these kids that are funded by Hamas and Hezbollah.
They grow up hating.
He's been horrible to Israel.
You know what? I think it's habit. They do it out of habit.
What do you think of Prime Minister Netanyahu?
I think he's good. I like him.
Strong.
He's always been -- he's strong. He's always been good to me. He asked me to do a commercial for him. I was his only celebrity that he asked to do a commercial, Would you do a commercial, when he ran for office. But I think he's very good. I think he's been treated very, very badly by Obama.
Let me get you to expand -- you always talk about trade, free trade. You say you're free trade, or fair trade.
Look, I want to be smart trade. It's good to be smart.
But not protectionist.
No, not protectionist. But you have to use that as a -- as a...
Leverage.
Of course.
In negotiations.
We don't use anything. Hey, look, we let China dump their stuff on us, but if you try and do business in China, you can't. I mean, it's impossible. You can't get your stuff in. It's very hard.
Right.
You can't get your stuff in. And you have to pay tax. So it's got to be equal. It's not equal. And we're losing $500 billion this year...
In a trade deficit with China.
We have a trade deficit with China. We're $500 billion -- I'm going to negotiate. Believe me, we're not going to...
You want U.S. cars sold in China.
I want -- yes. And I want them made here and sold in China.
Exactly.
Like Boeing. Boeing goes and takes an order, now they have to build airplane factories in China. And be careful, South Carolina and other places, and Seattle, by the way...
Yes.
Nobody's ever done it like China. And I told the folks last night, right here, I said, Be careful of your Boeing plant because you think it's good now, but in three years, when the ones are built, the big ones in China, and the currency manipulation takes place, South Carolina is going to have a problem.
Think how bad the economy is when you talk about banks now charging you to keep your money.
Yes, that's right. It's opposite. It's opposite.
Let me ask you this. You actually said something that really intrigued me. There's still 28 pages of the 9/11 commission report...
Right.
... that have never been revealed.
Right. And they should reveal it.
I got the impression that you knew something maybe we don't know about the Saudis...
I think you'll find out when that's opened -- I think you're going to find out Saudi Arabia had a lot to do with ripping down of the World Trade Center.
Would you open that if you became president?
I would open it, yes.
That's pretty interesting. I played a tape for you on my radio show the other day. Bill Clinton gave a speech. He'd been offered bin Laden, knew bin Laden was a threat...
Should have taken him out.
Should have taken him out.
Should have taken him out.
And also, even though you were against the war -- and you and I had some debates at the time. You were against the war from the beginning.
Totally against the war. And you would know that because you and I have been doing this for a long time.
We just disagree.
And you and I used to fight about it.
We used to fight about it.
Now you probably say Trump was sort of, like, right. Not sort of right.
Well, the thing is, once we go to war, what I'm afraid of is -- we lose 58,000 people in Vietnam, we lose 5,000 people in Iraq, and then Obama politicizes it or they politicize Vietnam, and why did we send American sons and daughters to fight, bleed and die, and then we only give Ramadi, Fallujah, Mosul and Tikrit over to ISIS? That's insanity!
We shouldn't have gone into Iraq because we destabilized the Middle East. OK, once we're in...
You win.
... the way we got out was horrible. You win. You're right. But the way we got out was horrible, where he announces a date, and now the enemy pulls back, and they say, Why should we fight? You know, despite what you hear, they don't want to die. They say, Why should we fight? We get out, and the mess starts. But we should have left troops. I didn't want to go in, but we should have left troops there.
And keep -- and sustain the victories we have.
We should have done something.
And I do agree with you about keeping the oil and giving the money to the military.
I've been saying it for four years.
Why are we paying the cost?
Now ISIS is so rich, and also paying the cost for all of these armies that we're supporting. I mean, Saudi Arabia, so rich, making a billion dollars a day before the oil went down, so now they're making half, right?
I was glad to hear you say the other day there were only three people that were waterboarded totally. One was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who gave the information about the courier that led to bin Laden...
Right.
In other words, whatever it took to get information.
Whatever it took. Excuse me. And I prefaced it by saying in the Middle East, they're chopping off heads. I haven't seen that since medieval times. I read when I was a young guy in history class, I would read about medieval times, they chopped off heads. Now James Foley, these wonderful people -- I know his parents. They're incredible people. They're chopping off heads.
Scary.
OK?
It's evil in our time.
And here we are, they're chopping off heads. And we want information about them and we can't waterboard, OK? We can't waterboard. No. So when they came to me -- by the way, it was very interesting. They came to me. They asked me the same question. I said, I'd approve it immediately, but it's got to be worse. And I got a standing ovation. I didn't know what I was going to get. You know, I didn't exactly poll it. I don't poll things.
You don't have pollsters at all.
No, I do what's right.
What's your reaction to Obama saying Donald Trump won't be president, I don't believe he'll be president?
Well, I was complimented. He's been the worst president in the history of our country. I was complimented. And I actually said it's lucky he didn't -- that I didn't run four years ago because, unfortunately, Romney didn't take us to the promised land. It didn't work out for Romney. But I said, You're lucky I didn't run four years ago because you wouldn't be a two-term president. And I really mean that. I think I would have -- you remember when I was thinking about running and...
I do remember.
... I was number one in all the polls and everything. But I was very busy. I had many, many jobs going up all over the world, and I had my children that were sort of young and learning. And well, now they're in great shape, Ivanka, Don, Eric, and I have great executives. So doesn't matter.
Conservatives were concerned in the debate about -- you said about Planned Parenthood, They do good things for women. I just don't like the abortion side. Here's my question.
That's what I said. It's true.
... no taxpayer money.
No, not while they do abortions. I made that clear. I made that clear, I think, at the debate.
All right, last question. Things are getting heated. It always happens historically in South Carolina. You threatened a lawsuit with Cruz. Where does that stand?
Well, we'll see. I mean, I have a couple of them in theory. Was he born -- he was born in Canada. He lived there for four years. He was a citizen of Canada until 15 months ago.
Mr. Trump, good to see you.
Thank you, Sean.
Thank you. Appreciate it.
Thanks, Sean.
Donald, nice to see you.
Thank you.
Were you surprised, though, yesterday, or whenever you heard, to wake up, to find out that you and the pope were embroiled in this global dispute?
Well, maybe surprise isn't quite stronger. How about shocked?
I spoke to Prime Minister Tony Blair, former Prime Minister Tony Blair a number of years ago and he said that he agreed with President Obama on that decision because everybody thought that there were weapons of mass destruction. That that was the intelligence they were getting.
They made a mistake.
They made a mistake. What should they have done differently?
Well, by the way, Tony Blair thinks it's now a great error. I mean, I've seen --
But China doesn't want Kim Jong-un to fail I don't think or to fall apart because they fear that the people in North Korea are going to flee into China. They don't want all those refugees.
You're right. But China has tremendous power over him, I mean, in terms of food, just getting there. China is the key.
Do you have any problem with the fact that it was strictly a civil settlement?
I don't -- I don't have a huge problem with it because I understand.
But you know who pays for this? It's not the culprit. It's the shareholders and those that are going to have to -- you know, the shareholders pay for it.
If somebody did fraudulent, absolutely. If somebody made bad business decisions, absolutely not. You know, you can't -- the problem is --
How about Senator Rubio?
Well, you know, we've had a pretty cordial relationship relatively speaking. It will be interesting to see how he does. It will be a very interesting Saturday.
If you are the nominee, what is your criteria for vice president?
Somebody that can be a great president. You know, it's really a simple criteria.
Do you have any names?
I do. I have names in mind, but I don't want to think about it. I have to get there.
Somebody in politics or would you go out to politics?
I would go in politics, because I'm out of politics. Now, I've been a politician all my life in a sense that I deal with politicians all my life. But I'm out of -- I am, you know, look, I would rather get somebody that could rather really do a job within politics. We don't need two of me. We need one of me and we need a politician and we have to get the right guy.
What's surprise --
I can't believe that I'm sort of a politician now, but one day it was going to happen.
Donald, thank you for talking to me.
Thank you very much.
Do you think you have this nomination in hand?
No, no, not at all. I mean, look, I'm -- I'm dealing with very talented people, very smart people, great politicians. And Ben Carson is still in, I understand, and he's a terrific guy and a talented guy. So, you know, I'm dealing with very smart people, talented people. So I'd never take it for granted.
Mr. Trump, thanks for joining us this morning.
Thank you very much.
Joining us now from Palm Beach is Donald Trump, winner of the South Carolina primary. Mr. Trump, congratulations, and welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.
Thank you very much, Chris.
You talk about your empire, I'm sure you have a ton of lawyers and a ton of accountants. Don't voters deserve to get a look at your finances, sir?
Oh, I think so. I've already given my financial statements more than anybody's given --
No, but the tax return?
They turned out to be about five times greater than anybody ever thought. No debt, very little debt. Tremendous cash flow. Some of the greatest assets in the world which is the thinking that our country needs to get rid of its $19 trillion, etcetera, and to make good deals.
But the tax returns?
But I've given -- tax returns, at the appropriate time. There's no rush, at the appropriate time.
Are we going to see you at the FOX debate on March 3rd?
Yes, I expect to be there. Sure.
Well, I like forward to seeing you, sir. Mr. Trump, thank you. Thanks for your time today.
Thank you, Chris. You too.
Safe travels on the campaign trail, sir.
Thank you very much.
OK.
People are not going to die on the sidewalk if I'm president, OK?
Well, let me get something definitive from you...
When I say that...
-- on this.
-- Chuck, I say that...
Right.
Excuse me. I say that to packed houses with thousands and thousands of people...
Yes.
-- Republicans, mostly, and I get standing ovations. I'm not going to let that happen. If I'm president, we're not going to have people dying on the streets. So you can call it whatever you want.
No, I understand that.
I don't call it a mandate.
Well, let me ask you this...
I just say it's common sense.
A...
We're going to have to get plans. They're going to be a lot less expensive than Obamacare. They're going to be private and there are going to be lots of different options. We're going to have...
Let's play...
-- so that you can't get competitive bidding.
-- you'd defund it. Now, the government will say Democrats...
That's right, I would.
Now, clearly, you didn't sound like an enthusiastic -- enthusiastic supporter of the war and -- but I am curious to the second part of that quote...
I wasn't.
Yes.
-- a good guy, different from what you see on the radio, OK. I won't say it. But if you look at my conversation, I was a very -- that was probably the first time -- don't forget, I was in business. I was a businessman.
Right.
I was a real estate man and a businessman. That was the first time I think that question was ever even asked of me. That was long before the war took place. That was, you know, many, many months before the war took place.
Right.
And you could see by my answer, I wasn't exactly thrilled...
Right.
-- Joe Scarborough just released something yesterday more on point, much nearer, and he put out a Tweet saying that, you know, this...
All right.
-- and now they're finally taking over Iraq. As we sit here, they're taking over Iraq.
Well, let me...
We get nothing.
-- let me give you one more issue where you sort of went counter to what is perceived as Republican orthodoxy...
OK. Fine.
OK.
-- of the other side. So that's all I'm saying.
We'll be watching on Tuesday.
Thank you very much.
All right, Donald Trump.
And the pope was very nice, by the way. Yesterday, the pope issued a very nice statement. And I appreciated it.
Best interview in America, Donald Trump, is back. Donald Trump, congratulations, big win on Saturday night, huge, actually. You won every category of every demographic.
Well, thank you very much. It was great. The people are fantastic. That area of the world is great. And we had a good time, and we had numbers that were even better than projected, so we're very happy about it.
Now I think your secret weapon is Ivanka. Has she had the baby, yet? Donald Trump? We can't hear him.
Yes, I hear you. We just cut out.
OK, has Ivanka...
My secret weapon is Ivanka. I saw you on one of the shows, and I was very honored, because I think you got it right. That was something we agree on.
Oh, we, absolutely. She is the second best interview. But has she had the baby, yet?
No, about a week. It looks like it's about a week away.
All right, now...
And in fact, I've been to three cities now, and every time I go there, I say we have a hospital ready.
I...
And she's a great person. She really is. She's great.
Every Monday quarterback in America wants to know why Donald Trump doesn't announce that Ted Cruz will be his nomination to the Supreme Court, and Marco Rubio will be his Vice President, and then you lock it up and it's done. Have you heard that?
Well, I don't know. I'm not so sure about that, and you know, I have heard that a little bit. People sort of like that, some people, and some people probably don't like it at all, as you can imagine. But it's been a very interesting experience. We're doing really well, and I'm in Nevada now, and I think you know, based on the polls, but of course, you never know what happens here. A lot of strange things happen here, and the caucus system is dangerous, to use a very nice word. It's sort of a dangerous system. But we'll see what happens. We should do pretty well tomorrow.
Jon Ralston tells me you're going to win, and you're going to win big, and he's forgotten more about Nevada politics than everybody else knows.
That's right. He's a great guy. He's a great guy, and he really knows this state better than everybody, and I saw him actually today talking about that, so I hope he's right. I just think the caucus system throws wrinkles in it. I really don't believe it's a good system. You know, I like to have a person walk in, vote and leave, as opposed to walk in, sit around, and who knows what happens. So you know, that's my preference, but let's see. I mean, we should be in pretty good shape tomorrow.
All right, now let's talk about Ted Cruz and tax returns. First of all, when do we get tax returns, Donald Trump, because Mitt Romney got killed on this four years ago. And you've got to get them out there as well.
Well, we'll get them out at some point, probably. I mean, I'm looking at it. I told me people the other day start looking at it. You know, I have very, very complex, I have, did you ever see the picture, I tweeted a picture where the returns are like two feet high...
I didn't.
... which by the way it itself is ridiculous. But my returns are among the largest. I'm audited all the time by government. And I think every single year, I've had an audit for years. And you know, other people, friends of mine say they never get audited. I say congratulations. I have audits every year. So it's, you know, one of those things. But we are working. They're very complex papers, but we're working on it.
Will we get them soon, do you think?
I don't know. I have to ask my accounting people. But we'll be working on it. Everything is very much, you know, I gave my financials ahead of schedule, much ahead of schedule. I had a long time to give them, and I gave them immediately. And they were very complex, also, and very big, and they turned out to be extremely good, much better, actually, than people thought.
Yup.
I think you would agree to that.
I do. I do.
You know, they were...
Now let's talk about Ted Cruz. He fired his communications director today because of the...
Yeah.
Does that satisfy you that he's taken any steps that you think need to be taken?
Well, look, he's, we've had a lot of problems with him. And he's a person that doesn't like telling the truth. And I just find it hard to believe that some of the things he said. I can only relate him to me. I can't relate them to Ben Carson. He did a thing called a notice of violation or a violation notice, and it was a voter violation, and it was a terrible document. It was a fraudulent document. People don't even talk about that. You know, they talk about Ben, who really went through hell. I mean, what they did with Ben was incredible that he had left the race, and officially notified people that he had left the race, and vote for Cruz. That was terrible, and then they did the voter violation document, which looked like it came right out of the IRS. It looked so official, and scared people, and I guarantee, a lot of people went out and voted for him for that reason. And you know, then you see the other things. He's done things with me that are incredible. You know, he did two robo-calls on election day in South Carolina, on election day, and they were terrible. One was on the confederate flag, and the other one was on, I believe, gay marriage. And they were very, very rough, and very, very unethical to do. And that was done on election day. How would you like to be going to the polls, and you're notified that one came out, and then a couple of hours later, another one comes in. So he plays hardball, but, and I like hardball, and I've met a lot tougher people than him, believe me, many, many, many times tougher. But he has a real hard time with the truth.
All right, last, we've got 45 seconds. Can you assure conservatives that if you're the nominee and you win, that the Supreme Court nominee you'll come up with, you said delay, delay, delay. That's exactly right, Donald Trump, exactly right. But will you get us a Scalia?
Yeah, that would be my ideal. That would be my ideal. You know, I mentioned one name, Diane Sykes, who's very good and very respected, and very conservative, also. I mentioned, actually, two names at the debate.
Yup.
But, and those are both excellent names. Yeah, the ideal would be Scalia reincarnated.
Good to see you. Grab a seat.
Great guy. You are -- you are a great guy.
Right? It's good to see you. Congratulations.
Thank you.
Yes.
My son loves him. My son -- right?
You see who's sitting next to him, the number one show on the Strip. That's Carrie Fader.
Yes. Very good. Good group over here.
Can I...
So the answer's yes, but it'll take a little time, right?
It -- do you ever think now that this is going to happen? If we look at the polls for super-Tuesday -- now, you have a big lead here...
Right.
Nevada. It's all right...
Nevada.
Yes.
So I hope it works out well, but I think we're going to do quite well.
You know, one of the things -- I think the question I get asked most often about you -- and I've had the opportunity to interview on -- interview you on radio and TV a lot -- is you call yourself a common sense conservative.
Right.
How did you evolve -- everyone knows that you did have liberal positions in the past.
Right. Right.
How did you become a conservative? What -- what changed?
So I think I've always been very conservative financially, although I must tell you, if you look at my company right now -- very little debt and a tremendous cash flow. You know, I filed my papers, and everyone's like -- like, they -- it's a great company.
Yes. I know.
... because you have to have competitive bidding.
Well, that is what health care savings accounts are about.
Right. It really is, yes, and health care savings accounts are great. And it's much better, and you'll have your doctor, you'll have your plan. You know, president Obama lied so much in order to get Obamacare  passed. Twenty-eight times. You said 24. I actually heard 28. But he said you'd have your own doctor, you'd have your own plan. All these different things. And frankly, once...
Well...
Unless the Republicans...
Go ahead.
... give it more life, which is what they do constantly. I don't know -- I don't get it.
No. I think the Republicans have surrendered way too -- way too much.
How about the last budget? How about the last budget?
That was a surrender. Executive amnesty was a surrender...
Yes.
You're also spending less per vote...
Yes. I...
Yes.
A lot of people thought it was very funny. It was meant to be cute. But the truth is, he should have been at that funeral. That's a funeral that he should have been at. I mean, here we are, where he's trying to push somebody. And I don't blame him for that. He should try, but the Republicans absolutely shouldn't let it happen.
Hold the line.
And I'll tell you what I don't like. I mean, the first day, they said, Absolutely not. Absolutely not. And here we go again because the second day they say, Well, there is a minor chance that we could work -- and all of a sudden -- and now I see it coming.
I predicted that was coming.
Obama is a terrible negotiator with everything except when it comes to negotiating with the Republicans. He gets everything he wants. It's true.
It's a good point.
Look at the Iran deal. I mean, the Iran deal is one of the worst deals I've ever seen in my life negotiated, $150 billion -- we get nothing. We get nothing out of that deal.
But let me follow-up with this...
And Netanyahu, a good guy -- I mean, he was -- I have never seen -- he was so stressed. He couldn't -- he couldn't make his point. And even the fact -- look, having nuclear deals is a good thing, not a bad thing, but you want to make good nuclear deals, not horrible deals. And you don't want to pay $150 billion, etcetera, etcetera.
You want to see...
No, no. People have read...
Can I get you to clarify one thing that became an issue this week? You do -- do you or do you not support mandates? In order words, mandating that the American people...
No, I don't support them, but I want to take people with health care.
OK...
Look -- on health care. People are not going to die of -- I make many speeches to tremendous crowds of people. We have -- tonight, I'm going to have 12,000 people after this. And I tell...
Oh, I think that's a false narrative...
Can I tell you what?
... about conservatives, though. Yes.
I have these -- well, but I have these very stupid, highly conservative people...
Yes.
I mean, the point -- just to finish up, we want to have great health care. We're going to have much less expensive and it's going to be much better, etcetera. And you're only going to take what you need. You know, part of the problem with Obamacare, you're taking things that you don't need that you could never use. But we're going to have people -- there's going to be a certain segment of our society that doesn't have anything.
All of...
And we're going to -- we're going to have to take care of them, and we're going to -- maybe through Medicare. We're going to send them to hospitals and to -- we're going to take care of them. And every time I say it -- I don't think I've ever had somebody say, We don't want to do that. But it has to be explained, and some people call that a mandate. It's not a mandate.
How do we balance a budget? We've got $20 trillion in debt, $120 trillion in unfunded liabilities, 95 million Americans out of the labor force, 50 million in poverty, 46 million on food stamps, huge numbers. How do we help all of these people? How do we build up our military, which has been decimated under this...
Right. Right.
... president?
All things that I'm going to be doing.
How do we repeal and replace Obamacare  and still balance the budget so we don't rob our kids blind?
Well, Obamacare  is going to kill our budget because Obamacare ...
Already is.
Obamacare  -- yes, but the numbers in '16 and '17 and '18 are...
Could you do all that and balance a budget?
Yes, you can.
And how quickly? And how?
Well, you know, you say something, and you've been saying it for years and it sounds simplistic. It's actually not that simplistic. You've been talking about the penny plan, where you take a penny off for four or five years, etcetera, and I think actually you could do better than that.
One penny out of every dollar...
I actually think you can do better than that.
We don't bid out anything.
We're the largest purchaser of drugs in the world, we don't bid it out. A friend of mine who's a doctor came to me. He said, We don't bid it out. And I said, No way, no way. And then -- then he didn't understand why. As soon as I figured out that we actually didn't, I said, Well, why is because all of these that I'm running against, plus another group of about 400 people...
Yes.
... they take money. They take so much money. If we bid out the -- the purchase of drugs, this country would save hundreds of billions of dollars a year, and we don't do it.
Last question on the economy. You said that you would lower taxes.
Right.
Fewer -- there were a lot more people that wouldn't pay any tax.
Right.
How...
For years, I've been saying it...
And that changed your mind.
It changed my mind. And there have been other things. But it changed my mind. I mean, this is...
I know a lot's been made over -- you said good things about Planned Parenthood, but people -- I guess they missed the interviews you've done with me. You said...
No, they didn't -- no, you know what happened? They don't want to put it down. Look...
Because you said...
We have to be...
... you would not fund Planned Parenthood.
We have to be realistic. I know people having to do with Planned Parenthood. I know women that are -- you know, that are -- that use Planned Parenthood. They do certain things properly, cervical cancer, lots of different things. But I would not -- I would defund it if they're not -- if they're going to do the abortions. And I said that to people.
If they continue abortions...
Yes, but they serve a -- you know, they serve millions of women...
Let's talk about, if you get the nomination. A big part of being a president -- I've been to Trump Towers many times. I see how your operation works.
Right.
I wonder in my mind how that would translate if you become the president. Who are people, of the top of your head, that you would want to surround yourself with on important issues like national security, homeland security, the economy?
Yes. OK, so first of all, we have so many different elements. We have trade. I'll be so good on trade. You know, when I first announced on June 16th, I came down the escalator with Melania, and it was really a nice thing. But it takes guts to run for president. It takes a lot of courage to do this.
So you're free, fair trade?
Fair trade --
You said you believe at this point in the race that it is going to be Hillary Clinton. If you're the nominee do you view her as a formidable opponent? Somebody that's tough?
I would love to run against her. And I --
That would help.
I don't think our country is ready for communism. I really, I sort of like that. You know, when you say 97 per cent tax in order to take of these things -- and by the way, then you wouldn't have enough either. So --
All right, awesome. Hello Mr. Trump.
Hi.
My question to you is this. Being a millennial, how can you better inspire my generation of young voters and gain our support?
Say it again, the last part?
Hi Mr. Trump. It's so good to see you here in Las Vegas.
Thank you, nice to see you.
Right.
So it's a great question, the answer is yes. Thank you.
Can I do a follow-up on that? We obviously have the Supreme Court opening and you have told me in three separate interviews that you'd look for justices like Scalia and Clarence Thomas?
Right, that's right.
The constitution is the foundation of our rule of law. You read the constitution. What does it mean to you?
Well, the constitution is sort of everything. If you look at it and you look at what's going on, and the problem is our constitution is being badly denigrated by what's happening, as an example with Hillary Clinton, because you have other people that have done very little by comparison to what she's done with the emails and all of the security measures that are in place, and everything that's taken place, and she's just sailing along and running for president and --
Do you think she gets away with it?
I think so. I think she's going to get away with it if -- well, you know, look, there's a long-term statute of limitations. It depends, if a Republican gets in, you know, there's a long-term statute of limitations --
Well, that raises the next question. Would you appoint an attorney general --
I would certainly look into it. I think it's a disgrace. I think it's so bad. General Petraeus was destroyed, his life was destroyed. You have many, many other people, not just a few, you have many people that did far less than what she did --
All right, we have I believe is a Lauren --
So Sean --
Thank you by the way.
-- on a big downward, he's on a very big downward spiral.
It's very interesting as you watch her campaign and you watch the people around her and one has to wonder if 60 percent of the people of this country think she's dishonest and not trustworthy, how do you get elected with that?
Well, look, I think the government has to do something. I just don't see how they can get it -- and I will say if I'm the nominee this will not be a subject that's going to die very easily. I'll be talking about why nothing is happening.
So you think she's running for her own survival.
I think she's running a very important race, the most important race of her life, before, now not just because it's president. I mean, she's running a very important race for herself.
Look into it as best he can. I'm not -- I don't know everything about it. I just see what's going on.
But what side are you on? What side are you on? Do you have an opinion?
Hi. Thank you for taking my question.
Thank you.
So coming out of college I have close to $30,000 --
I know.
-- in student loan debt. And I know you said you plan to get rid Common Core education. But beyond that, what are your plans to make college more affordable?
We've got to do something with the cost of colleges. Now, what's happening is you're a conduit for government to give money to you to give to the college, and the colleges, their costs are going up by a factor that's faster than anything else practically is going up. People are making phenomenal salaries at the top. You know, our professors are teachers, we have to take care of them. It's very important. I mean, to me it's so important. But you look at how the costs have escalated for colleges. And all they're doing is the students essentially are giving them the money and yet you're borrowing too much money. I'm going to look into that very strongly and we have to do something to help the students. Sean, I get this question more than any other question I get.
It's so high.
These students are absolutely -- they have it up to their neck. They're not able to function. And then in many cases, on top of everything else, they can't get a job.
And you need a degree to gets doors opened.
We're going to do something. OK?
Do you think you'll be able to get the win tonight here?
We hope so. We have an awfully big crowd.
What are you plan -- did you expect to see anything like this, Mr. Trump?
No. Like this. This is incredible. Thank you.
How about to the Democrats? Do you have any message to Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders tonight?
Well, no, they've got their own race. I wish them both luck. I think proably Hillary looks like she's very successful but -- if she's allowed to run. We're going to find out whether or not she's going to be allowed to run.
All right. Thank you, Mr. Trump.
Hello, Rachel.
That's right.
But we're one and a half years and we're under budget and it'll open in September of this year and they were supposed to open up in September in two years from now. And I thought I could just have, you know, we really have a great team, Eric and Don are working on it and Ivanka is really in charge of that one and she's done an amazing job. And it's going to be one of the most beautiful hotels, I think it will be one of the great hotels of the world.
Yes.
They go up this pyramid chain and they pick them out very early and our people cannot deal with it because we're not using -- and we have the greatest business people in the world. We don't use them. So Carl Icahn is an example, endorsed me. Many of the business people endorse me, the great ones. And we're going to use our greatest business people to negotiate trade deals and we're going to not be losing this kind of money. We have horrible, horrible deals with Japan and everyone else.
What do you think that brought out for the voters tonight to your advantage?
Well, I think they see that I'm a guy that can handle people. I mean, I've done this people. I've created jobs, I've created great companies and a really great company, and I think it shows what you're made of. I think it's really a good test. But I enjoy the process. I've actually enjoyed every single debate.
During that debate as it was going on, Marco Rubio started on his website selling watches as a pretend gimmick to say that they were watches that, you know, that would have been yours that you would have been selling but they're just donations for him. It was a quick response during the actual debate what do you make of the move?
Well, look, the problem with Marco, he's a choke artist. He chokes. And he did it in front of Chris Christie. I've never seen anything like that. I was standing right next to him. I look over, I said are you OK? I mean, he was -- it looked like he just came out of a swimming pool, he was soaking wet and he kept repeating himself, repeating himself.
He tried to use that on you tonight.
No, no, but I didn't do any repeating, I mean, I just say, hey, I just say what's need. I didn't do that. But he really -- we can't have a choke artist. You know, one thing I've learned from sports. I was a actually a very good athlete. When you're a choker, you're always a choker. We can't have that. We can't take any chances in this country.
How long, now that you're starting to get the votes in and you're at the top, do you think that people should start thinking about leaving this race?
I think so, but, you know, it's not for me to say. I would say that a few of them maybe should. You know, Marco, I'm 20 points up with him in Florida, right? With Cruz I'm even, it seems the last polls I'm even in Texas and winning every other state. Yes, I think so. I think it's going to be over fairly quickly and I don't think there is going to be a convention.
It seemed like Senator Rubio was more intent to going at you directly tonight than even Senator Cruz. Why do you think that was?
I think that's true. I was a little surprised by it but I liked it. I thought it was fine. But, you know...
Do you think that the race is over for the nomination?
No, I never say it's over. It's not over until it's over, as our friend would say, right, Yogi. But I think we're doing really well. I love that Bloomberg poll. It did many of the southern states and we're just leading by tremendous numbers.
Do you think when you're standing on that stage tonight specifically, as you said, it was a focus someone of three-man dynamic tonight?
I thought it was very unfair, I must tell you, to Ben Carson and to the governor. I thought it was really pretty unfair because they weren't asked very many questions. And you know, they are the final five. And I actually though Ben in particular was treated unfairly. I don't think he was asked enough questions. It wasn't -- it wasn't right.
You're talking about each other that's what happens.
Yes. I think he had a right to be upset. But that's up to CNN. And the same is true I think with Kasich. You know, I just enjoyed it. I had a good time, I was in the middle of it and I really enjoyed the process. I love the process and I actually like debating.
They came at you tonight about something that's in the news right now that really is that your control, which was the tax returns.
Yes.
You know what would you do with this issue if somebody else had it? Would you say what are you talking about? The tax returns just put it out.
Nobody that is under a regular audit. I mean, it is just a regular audit I do almost every I think for 12 years, 10 years, 12 years, I get audited. Nobody would ever put out their returns that's under an audit. It's very unfair that I'm audited all the time. And by the way, I always passed the audit. Excuse, I have always passed the audit.
Why wouldn't you put it out because you're under audit just so people understand?
Of course you put it out. You are in the midst of negotiating and talking to the IRS. You never put it out. You would never do that. Your lawyers would never allow you to do that. It is a very simple audit. I think it perhaps will go fast and perhaps it won't. And when it is complete, you got them. I love it. But I think until that audit is done, certainly you wouldn't do that.
Did you anticipate both of them coming at you that way?
Yes. I did. I really anticipated it. I was prepared for it. I thought would happen. They're desperate. I mean, what are they going to do? They are losing by massive amounts. Rubio hasn't won anything. Ted one Iowa and that's under suspicious because of what he did to Ben Carson. So, you know, I mean their -- and he has lost very badly since then. I mean, Ted is -- I'm leading with evangelicals, I'm leading with men, with women, I am leading with everything. So he is under a lot of pressure. Hey, look. The politicians, they are under a great deal of pressure.
Have you heard anything from former Mexican president Vicente Fox?
Well, I think he should apologize for his foul mouth. I think it is a disgusting thing that he said. And I could tell you, I would not use that word. But if I did use that word, I probably wouldn't be even been allowed on the stage tonight.
How do you feel after tonight?
I feel great. I mean, I think we're doing so well. I think the debate was really one of my west debates considering the fact that is being hit from all sides.
It best to be tested, though, right?
It was a good test. It was really a good test. I really liked it. I enjoyed it. And now, I go down and I guess I speak to other people other than you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Chris. Take care of yourself.
Good luck, Mr. Trump.
Thank you.
Joining us first here now live is the front-runner, Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.
Thank you.
Mr. Trump --
I mean, when you think of that as being a con man, I don't think so.
But --
By the way, different laws and I didn't hire the Polish workers, Chris.
But let me ask you about that --
He hired the polish workers.
OK. We'll let me give you something else which is a lot more current --
All I did was hired a contractor. I didn't hire the Polish workers.
-- and that is, that he is hitting you on Trump University, a program that you helped set up --
OK.
-- that you said to share your real estate knowledge and so you could help people invest.
Yes.
Let me ask you about that, because this week -- this weekend --
I'm not a settler. You know what, Chris --
Let me ask you this though --
I don't believe in settling cases. I believe in winning cases.
I don't think I ever brought that up. I don't think I ever brought it up.
OK, well, you always talk about the fact that Trump doesn't do well with --
I do know that.
You talk about net worth. You don't learn -- you don't know that?
Can you tell us what the gross income is --
I've been singled out --
OK, I got -- I got you.
As far as taxes are concerned --
I've got two more questions I've got to ask you.
Go ahead.
Yes, I want to ask you about...
And the Republican Party is not being run properly.
The Ku Klux Klan?
But you may have groups in there that are totally fine, and it would be very unfair. So, give me a list of the groups, and I will let you know.
OK. I mean, I'm just talking about David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan here, but...
I don't know any -- honestly, I don't know David Duke. I don't believe I have ever met him. I'm pretty sure I didn't meet him. And I just don't know anything about him.
All right, Donald J. Trump, thank you so much. Good luck on Tuesday, sir. We will see you on the campaign trail.
Thank you. Thank you very much, Jake.
You...
I signed the pledge. And I will abide by the pledge, unless they default. But, as far as I'm concerned, they have defaulted.
What about...
... frankly, everything of real value -- hey, John, everything of real value is in my financial disclosure form.
Let me...
I always say to my people, how come I'm always audited and friends of mine are never audited?
Let me ask you.
I think it's very unfair.
All right. Mr. Trump, thanks for being with us. We will speak to you again soon.
Thank you very much.
And I'm joined now by Donald Trump, the Republican front- runner. Mr. Trump, welcome back to the program to MEET THE PRESS, sir.
Good morning.
Do you believe --
But I don't -- they don't have any proof of any illegals.
Do you use eVerify in everything you do when it comes to finding out the immigration --
Yes, I have it. I have eVerify. Yes, I do. And I use eVerify in that building. And The Washington Post  mentioned that they spoke to people. There's no names. I read the story. It was from a few months ago. There were no names whatsoever. They have no proof. They have no evidence, no nothing. They saw people and they were people coming out of the building. And they were absolutely -- we go with eVerify. I am extremely strong on it. Every time I have a contractor meeting on that building -- and we're doing fantastically well. You know, we're going to open that building in September, which will be very exciting, just before the election, perfect, I mean, you know --
The timing.
-- but I will tell you this, I am very -- the timing is good -- but I -- I am very, very tough on that. And they have absolutely no evidence whatsoever. It's a typical Washington Post story.
And you think it's because he's Hispanic?
-- an A from the Better Business Bureau. This is a case that should have been -- well, because of the wall and because of everything that's going on with Mexico and all of that, I think it's, frankly, this -- look, this is a judge who I believe has treated me very, very unfairly. This is a case that should have been thrown out a long time ago in the opinion of many great lawyers.
Mussolini is a known fascist.
-- people can Twitter 14 million people --
Do you want to be associated --?
It's a very interesting quote and people can talk about it.
Well, and it is trending on Twitter right now. Mr. Trump, I have to leave it there. Stay safe on the trail. We'll see you Super Tuesday. Could be a big night for you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Donald Trump joins us now on the phone. Mister Trump, good morning.
Good morning.
Let me just start off where Peter just ended up. I'm sure you've heard Marco Rubio's latest shot at you. It follows shots you've taken at him. I would say it's fair to say both childish, who has big hands, who has small hands, who has big ears, who has small ears, who sweats, who's a loser, who chokes. Can you blame people sitting across the country and around the world for saying, wait a minute, these guys are running for the most important and powerful job in the world?
Well, I never started this, Matt. I'm way ahead in the polls.
I'm not sure people would agree with that.
Sure. But I'm way ahead in the polls. And Rubio came out and started doing because he's desperate. He's -- he's twenty points behind in Florida. He's a no-show in Florida. The people of Florida, they wouldn't -- they wouldn't elect him dogcatcher. And frankly, he's -- he got desperate and all of a sudden he started doing personal attacks. So when somebody does a personal attack, you hit them back and I hit them back very hard.
But at this stage of the race, Mister Trump, don't the voters deserve to hear answers to their questions --
Yes.
-- as opposed to childish insults?
I do. I agree. But when you have one of the people running that gets personal, I always believe in answering back. And I answered back and I would continue to answer back. But, you know, it hasn't helped him in the polls because his polls have actually gone down since he's doing it. But he did it because he's desperate. He's losing Florida. He's losing all over the place. I don't really blame him for doing it because the other -- his other approach was not working, so I don't blame him. But it is politics, Matt. I mean, it's something that happens. I mean, he was desperate. He's down in the polls. He's a nervous wreck. I watched him -- I watched how his melt -- I watched his meltdown against Chris Christie.
Mister Trump, let's -- let's --
And -- and the guy -- he wanted to go a different approach.
OK. I think we're -- I think we've cleared that up. Let's talk about another issue that has bubbled up. And this is your comments on a CNN program where you were asked about David Duke, former grand wizard of the KKK. You said three times in this interview, "I don't know who David Duke is," and you refused to disavow or distance yourself from him. Now, a lot of people are scratching their heads over that because, number one, you disavowed David Duke two days prior. Why are you pretending that you -- or acting as though you don't know who this person is? Why not disavow David Duke, disavow the KKK? What's going on?
Well, first of all, he talked about David Duke and other groups. He talked about other groups, OK?
Yeah. But you said three times --
Excuse me.
-- "I don't know who David Duke is."
Excuse me. No, no. Well, I know who he is, but I never met David Duke. So he's -- when you talk about it, I never met David Duke.
But in 2000, you refused to run on the Reform Party's platform because David Duke was a member of it.
I disavowed David Duke a day before a major press conference. And I'm saying to myself, how many times do I have to continue to disavow people? And the question was asked about David group -- David Duke and various groups. And I don't know who the groups are. I said, would you do me a favor and tell me the groups. He was unable to tell me that.
He says, "I'm just talking about David Duke and the Klu Klux Klan here." And you said, "Honestly, I don't know David Duke."
Let me tell you. OK. So let me tell you. I'm sitting in a house in Florida with a very bad earpiece that they gave me and you could hardly hear what he was saying. But what I heard was various groups. And I don't mind disavowing anybody. And I disavowed David Duke and I disavowed him the day before at a major news conference, which is surprising because he was at the major news conference. CNN was at the major news conference and they heard me very easily disavowed David Duke. Now, I go and I sit down again. I have a lousy earpiece that is provided by them. And frankly, he talked about groups. He also talked about groups. And I have no problem with disavowing groups but I'd at least like to know who they -- who they are. It would be very unfair to disavow a group, Matt, if the group shouldn't be disavowed. I have to know who the groups are. But I disavowed David Duke. Now, if you look on Facebook right after that, I also disavowed David Duke. When we looked at it, and looked at the question, I disavowed David Duke. So I disavowed David Duke all weekend long on Facebook, on Twitter and, obviously, it's never enough. It's ridiculous.
Real, real quickly. There's a big piece in the New York Times yesterday, Mister Trump, about the Republican establishment's efforts over the past couple of months to derail your campaign. Governors got together and met and talked about writing a letter to the American people disavowing your brand and your candidacy. In your opinion, right now on the eve of Super Tuesday, has the Republican establishment lost its opportunity to stop you?
Well, I think I'm doing very well. A Reuters poll came out where I'm at forty-four and forty-five and -- and other people are at eleven, so that's a pretty big lead, to put it mildly. That's a national poll. So I'm doing very, very well. I'm doing well in all of the states. I'd love to win Texas. That's the only one where I'm a little down to a sitting senator who's done a terrible job, hasn't done a damn thing for the people of Texas. So I think I have a chance of winning Texas. I think I'll win Florida in two weeks because Rubio is a no-show. He's -- he's done a terrible job for Florida. He's defrauded Florida. He never shows up for votes. So I think I'm going to win Florida.
You said yesterday you feel like --
And even though I've been doing -- I'm doing very well.
You said yesterday you feel like in a sense that if the Republican establishment gets together and has some organized way to try to defeat you, that they're violating their pledge to you. And if that's the case, what's -- what's -- what's your next step? What would you do about that?
Well, if they violate the pledge, which possibly they've already done, as you understand, if they violate the pledge, I will do something that would make them very unhappy. I have millions and millions of followers. We had the endorsement yesterday of Jeff Sessions, Senator Jeff Sessions, one of the most respected people in the Senate, and we attended a -- a -- an event that was so incredible in Alabama, with thirty- five thousand people. I don't know if you covered -- everybody covered it, but I don't know if you talked about the number of people. We have thirty- five thousand people in a foot -- in a big football stadium.
Right.
And he said he has never seen anything like that and he's been in politics for thirty years. He has never seen an event like that with that people and that kind of love.
Donald --
We have tremendous -- we have tremendous support. And I think, frankly, the Republican Party should get behind me because we're opening up to Republican Party. When I won in South Carolina, we got far more votes than the Democrats got.
Right.
You know, if you look at our votes versus the Democrats, we get far more votes. And we get far more votes than we got four years ago. We're opening up the party. Democrats are coming in. I call them the Reagan Democrats.
Let's choose -- let's choose that as --
Independents are coming in. It's a far bigger party. I've done a very great service for the Republican Party.
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
All right, Mr. Trump. If you shake every hand...
Hi, everybody! Hi, everybody!
Mr. Trump, can I take a selfie with you?
You got it.
You got the selfie, too?
How are you?
Nice to see you, sir.
Hello, Sean.
Forty-nine percent!
That's big. That's a big number.
You know what's funny? I was watching some of the coverage of the other primaries, and I see these pundits. Some of them are so dumb. And they actually say, Well, if his person leaves or that person leaves, you take all of those numbers, every one of them, and give it to them, and Donald Trump may lose.
I've heard it many times, and in fact, from some of the folks on FOX, I must say.
If you look at the polls, only state that you are really behind in tomorrow going in is Texas.
Yes, little bit.
So what does that mean?
I think we have a good chance in Texas. Look, you know, we're ahead in every state. You know, it was very interesting, if you look at South Carolina, we were supposed to lose that, and we won in a landslide. We were supposed to lose Nevada, and we won in a landslide. And New Hampshire was so great right from the beginning. And I don't know. I mean, I think we're going to do well, but we'll see what happens.
It was a pretty brutal weekend. I mean, if you believe some of your opponents -- let's see, you're a member of the mob and...
That was a new one.
But you know, there is a chance tomorrow night we will know after all the results are tallied that the only two people that will have won states, and you will have won the majority of them, are you and Ted Cruz.
Yes.
But what does that say about the other candidates, if they can't win a state...
It means it's tough for them.
I know a guy that runs a medical center and it's a practice that people join in Wichita, Kansas. They buy -- they literally buy drugs in mass directly from the pharmaceuticals at discounted rates, and they pay next to nothing.
And the government pays much more.
And the government pays 10 times more. Crazy, right?
It's very sad.
Let me talk about...
Honestly, it's very sad.
I know you do.
And you and O'Reilly...
Greta.
... a little bit rough, and Greta, and so many others.
I've been down to the border for the FOX News Channel.
Right.
And I've been all the way from the Rio Grande to San Diego. I was in a drug warehouse bigger than this room, floor to ceiling drugs. I was in an office building in San Diego. A tunnel had been dug from Mexico.
Right.
I was there when gang members were arrested. Believe it or not, I was on horseback, all-terrain vehicle, helicopters...
Right.
... and boats.
Right.
The New York Times is claiming today that they had an off-the- record conversation with you in January. Off the record, by the way, now they're leaking it.
Yes, of course.
Typical media.
No, no. The most dishonest media group. And it's also failing. I call it the failing New York Times. It is doing so badly, it's dying. But I did, they had a -- we had a board meeting. It was off the record. All of a sudden, they leak it. It's all the over the place.
But it's not negotiable about building it.
I actually said -- I -- no, building it? Not negotiable.
It'll be part of...
... $10 billion is not bad.
It'll be...
Part of the whole thing.
And I don't think a lot of people understand where competition is instituted in state lines.
That's right.
Do you go as far as health care savings accounts?
I did. And I mentioned that.
Yes.
I talked about health care savings accounts. I said get rid of the lines, you're going to have competition. Then they said, Oh, be more specific. Let me tell you, the competition is going to make it specific. You're going to have hundreds of different deals. You're going to have many people coming in and competing. They're all going to be different.
So in other words, the companies that offer the best deal...
Right.
... at the best price...
Correct.
... will get the most business.
To individual people, and companies.
So it's a free market system.
It's a free market system.
And you did get -- and a lot of people said -- I've never felt that as a conservative that people want people to die in the streets. I think we've always taken care of those that need help.
Yes.
Why did you get criticized for that?
I don't understand it. I must tell you. Look, there are going to be some people -- you can say free market, you can say it's going to be much cheaper. "Obamacare" is horrible. It's -- you know, your premiums are going up 45, 50 percent. It's a horror show.
And the government buys drugs in bulk. The government will...
They'll buy -- and things will be -- now, most people are going to be able to buy their plan. It's going to be a much better plan than they have now for a lot less.
Yes.
But I'm not going to allow people to die on the sidewalks in the street. And you know when I make that in a speech in front of all Republicans and -- I get standing ovations.
Yes.
I mean, it's crazy. Who wants to let that happen? I'm not going to let it happen.
Just for the benefit of time, an issue that came up in the debate, too, was the issue of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
Right. Right.
You know, I look at the Palestinians -- here's Israel, '67, '73, Israel has offered everything but the moon to get peace with the Palestinians.
Right.
I'm going to ask you a last question...
It would be good for everybody. If we could make peace, that would be great.
Last question. We have a -- only a minute. ISIS, radical Islamic terrorism...
Right.
Is this a lifelong struggle, do you think, against radical Islamists?
It certainly seems it. It's a horrible thing. Something's going on. And you know what I did with respect to Muslims. There's something going on and we don't know. It's a temporary halt. We have to have a temporary ban.
So, are you prepared right now to make a clear and unequivocal statement renouncing the support of all white supremacists?
of course, I am. I mean, there's nobody that's done so much for equality as I have. You take a look at Palm Beach, Florida, I built the Mar-a-Lago Club, totally open to everybody; a club that frankly set a new standard in clubs and a new standard in Palm Beach and I've gotten great credit for it. That is totally open to everybody. So, of course, I am.
Mr. Trump, thanks for joining us this morning.
Thank you very much.
Joined now on the phone by the Republican front-runner for the presidential nomination, Donald Trump. Mister Trump, good morning.
Good morning, Matt.
Mister Trump, it's Savannah. We just got some excerpts from Mitt Romney's speech today. He calls you among other things a phony, a fraud and he says you're playing Americans for suckers. Your response?
Well, he begged me four years ago for my endorsement. I mean literally begged me and he is a failed candidate. I mean, frankly, I backed him. He failed. He was a horrible candidate. Didn't know what he was doing. He disappeared in the last months before the election while, in all fairness, Barack Obama is doing all of the shows, Jay Leno. He was doing David Letterman all the time and -- and this guy disappeared. He went away and he got killed in the -- he got -- he got decimated in the election. Now I will say this, if you look at what's happening and you see I've won a lot of different states, but maybe more importantly, millions and millions of people are joining the Republican Party and going out to vote. And on the Democrat side, you will see what's happening. They're down thirty percent. The Republicans are way up higher than they have ever been and setting records because people are energized by what I'm saying, the American -- the American worker is making less money now than they made twelve years ago, Matt, and we're losing all of our trade. We're losing our jobs and people are tired of it.
I want to go back to Mitt Romney for a second, Mister Trump. Do you fear that he could now become a unifying voice in this fractured and frantic effort on the establishment side to stop you?
Mitt Romney is a stiff. Mitt Romney will not get elected. Mitt Romney failed twice and really failed last time. He was going against a President that should have been beaten. The President was not doing well and he should have been beaten. That should have been an easy election. The problem is nobody came out to vote for Mitt Romney. And I'm talking about Republicans. They didn't come out. I mean it's well documented. I'm not just saying this.
Right.
They didn't come out to vote for Mitt Romney.
The next question I have, you may have just answered it with that answer. But tonight at the debate it seems highly likely that the three other candidates left on the Republican side are going to go after you. They're going to save their fire for you. So the question is, how will you respond tonight? Will you be that guy who just called Mitt Romney a stiff or will you be that guy who tried to appear much more presidential? For example at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday night. Who is the real Donald Trump?
Well, it's different. Look, I have these guys like this lightweight Marco Rubio who doesn't even show up to vote for the people of Florida. He has defrauded the people of Florida. And I can't imagine anybody from Florida wanting to vote for this guy. But I -- I -- if you take a look at what's going on, I can't act overly presidential because I'm going to have people attacking me from every side. A very good man, Ben Carson is not there any longer. So now we're going to have more time for, you know, the fighting. I can't stand there and act presidential --
Why not?
-- when I have people throwing out --
Why can't you be presidential and say I'm above this?
Let me tell you, because when people are hitting you from different angles, from all different angels, unfortunately, Matt, you have to hit back. I -- I would have a very, very presidential demeanor when I win, but until such time you have to hit back. When you hit back, you're no longer presidential, unfortunately.
Mister Trump, on another topic, a lot of Republican leaders in the last few days have said the final straw for them was this controversy over the weekend about David Duke and the KKK. Now in fairness to you, you have since disavowed David Duke. You said I disavow but many Republicans --
Not since disavowed.
And before --
Not since disavowed. I disavowed him many times over the years. I disavowed and -- and --
That's why it was so weird when you didn't do so on the CNN interview. People were surprised at that.
But, Savannah, he was talking about different groups and he couldn't tell me who the groups were, I said name --
Right. But you, yourself --
-- the groups.
OK. Not to go over this again but you yourself said I don't know who this David Duke is three times --
No, no. I didn't --
So clearly you knew he was talking about David Duke.
Savannah, what I meant by that is I never met David Duke. I know who David Duke is. I know him from --
OK. But that's not what you said.
But I don't -- I -- I, excuse me, excuse me. I'll tell you what I meant. You don't know, I know. I never met David Duke. I don't know him from the standpoint I never met him. But I certainly would not have anything to do with him or the KKK. And everybody knows that. And I say how many times do I just have to disavow. And right after that I tweeted that I disavow any, you know, any endorsement or anything of David Duke. Who would endorse David Duke?
Well, that was just my question --
So I said --
-- to kind of give you the chance to say and convince these folks --
OK. OK. Let me say it again for the --
-- that this is not something you want.
Savannah, let me say it again for the twentieth time. I disavow David Duke and the KKK and anybody else who preaches hate. Is that OK? Is that, I mean, are you going to now ask me about it the next show when I call in? So I disavow David Duke and obviously the KKK but I have been doing this from the time this question has been asked.
Right, except for that one time which is why people were wondering about it.
I don't know. I don't know.
But I think -- I think we settled it.
I -- I -- I think I've done it and -- and he was talking about groups. And in all fairness to groups, there may be a group in there that shouldn't be disavowed. And I think it's very unfair to a group if that's the case. I don't know. But he talked about, as I remember, the word groups and obviously but I would obviously --
But if they are white supremacist groups, I think you've made it clear, you don't want their vote, is that what you're saying?
I don't want their vote.
OK.
And I've said it. And I think I've said it many times and I might -- maybe I said it better the first time and the fourth time and the ninth time but I disavow and I disavowed right from the beginning.
Donald Trump, thank you for being with us. We appreciate you calling in.
Thank you very much.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Well, let me -- let me ask you about that, because it's one of the most stunning numbers that we saw election night. I believe that Chuck Todd talked about it yesterday morning on the show, that it's almost a complete reverse of what happened with Barack Obama in 2008.
Right. Right.
So -- so, if the Republican Party -- Donald, let me ask you this, let me ask you this.
Go ahead.
So, Donald...
They didn't -- hey, Mika, they didn't vote for Romney last time.
Right.
Now, they didn't exist, because they were Democrats and independents, but they didn't vote for Romney. The Republicans didn't vote for Romney last time.
Well, I want it on the record on this show. Let me follow up, and then I'll open it up...
Mika, just to put it clear, I disavowed him in the past, and I disavow him now. And it was very clear that I disavowed, but the press doesn't want to go with it. They just love the story. By the way, if you look at my Twitter, which took place just about the same time as that show, you'll see I disavowed right there, too.
Well his -- my question -- one of my questions is, has he offered a settlement? Has Schneiderman offered you a settlement?
Well I don't think I've given him the opportunity.
For people unfamiliar with Trump University, how did it work? Was it a semester long? Would I get a bachelor of arts from Trump University?
It was different courses. It was different courses on, you know, real estate.
Hey, Donald, Donald, it's Willie. Good morning, good to talk to you.
Hi, Willie.
So the plan right now appears to be in the Republican Party is for your opponents to stay in the race long enough to peel away delegates so you can't get that majority and clinch the nomination before you head to the convention.
Right.
Right.
It's time to make a change. Now, a real change by somebody who knows what he's doing.
Donald, I understand what you're saying there, but what do you do when you get to Cleveland without a majority of the delegates? Do you have a plan, and what does that look like?
I don't know. Hey, Willie, Willie, I will just do my best. Look, I'm going to have more votes than anybody else, I brought millions and millions of people into the Republican Party in a short period of time. The only one that's going to beat Hillary Clinton is me, because New York will be in play, Michigan will be in play, great states will be in play that none of these people, like a guy like Marco Rubio, you know, this guy doesn't even show up to vote in the Senate. You know, he's ridiculous. He doesn't even show up to vote.
Yeah.
He has defrauded the people of Florida. The guy doesn't show up to vote.
So, so Donald -- but -- Donald -- yeah...
And I don't know what he's doing. Here is the point, the point is, I brought millions of people into a party, all of those people whether I do independent or not, Joe, and Willie, all of those people are going to leave the party, they're going to get back and they're to go back to where they came from.
They're saying some very nasty things about you, but can you reach out and bury the hatchet and say, "Let's go together as one party?"
Joe, I would have no problem doing it at all, but here is the problem, I have not been recognized for having done something that nobody has ever done before. We have a party that's stagnant and dying, we have a party that's...
Right.
All you have to do is ask Mitt Romney. No -- he -- millions of Republicans -- I'm not talking about independents and Democrats, which I'm getting -- I'm getting independents -- millions of Republicans didn't show up last time to vote.
I understand.
Knocking the hell out of me and it's really unfair, I want to tell you something. But if I leave, if I go, regardless of independent, which I may do, I mean, may or may not, but if I go, I will tell you these millions of people that joined, they've told them, they're all coming with me. They're going...
But Donald, you're missing the point. This is what happens in politics, people try to kill you and then they come together at the end.
Yes, I know that. I have no problem with that, Joe.
Thank you very much for coming on the show this morning.
OK. Thank you very much.
Since I'm live at 11:00, I don't know who this guy is. He's been following me around all day. Now look, we're standing mano a mano here, you're not going to be taller than me. So the debate?
I thought they did a really good job. I enjoyed it. It was tough, but fair.
Who is your main competition in your opinion going forward? Come on, come on, no, no, stop, stop.
Well Ted Cruz seems to have, you know, he's second...
Yeah.
Quite a distance away but he's second. Marco would be third, the governor would be fourth.
And do you think that's the way it's going to shake?
Probably well, that's the way it is right now. It can change very rapidly.
All right. You look a little tired. Are you tired?
No.
No. OK. Romney hit you hard today. Are you surprised?
He's a failed candidate.
I know, I know. But were you surprised?
I'm just telling you, he did a horrible job, he wants to become relevant again. He really let us down. Four years ago I supported him and helped him a lot. He really, really let us down. He knows I feel it. And, I guess he felt it. He said that. But I think my retort was far stronger than his, and if you look on Twitter and if you look at what's happening, I think he made a fool out of himself if you want to know the truth.
Why do you think he did it?
Because I think he's a jealous guy and I think he'd like to run but he didn't have the guts to run this time. And he probably should have. I don't think he would have done very well and I told him he was a joker, I mean he's a joke artist and that's what happened with his last...
Do you think he's angling to going to the convention if you don't have enough delegates?
Well it might be, and that's why he didn't support anybody but he doesn't have, he would be beaten so badly by Hillary Clinton, your head will spin. So, he doesn't have it.
When you hear guys like Romney and there are not a few of them, there are many of them in your party.
Right.
Why do you think you engender so much loathing from them?
No and love, and love.
Yeah I mean, you have plenty of die hard supporters.
65 percent and believe me, a big, big portion, if you look at all of the polls that are coming in now above 50. And I will tell you, a tremendous amount of the party loves what we're doing. You see the numbers of people, millions of people are joining the Republican Party. You can't say it's happening...
All right. You got a lot of detractors and people like Romney, you come out...
I think once it's over, I think people are going to get along, not everybody but people are going to get along with me well very well. I'm very much a unifier.
What about you, or personality engenders these people to come after you.
I tell it like it is. I tell the truth.
I mean, but Romney feels that you're a danger to the country.
I don't think he feels that at all.
Do you think this is all contrived.
I would say mostly contrived. I think he feels very badly about his poor run, he run very poorly. He made a fool out of himself, should have won that election, he went way for the final four weeks.
But why would he come back now though. I mean he's been out for so long.
Well I was hitting him hard because when he was going to come back, I was saying he was a choke artist. I mean he choked. He choked in the last campaign. I mean, he really, look he lost in the senate and he really lost twice for president, not just once. So he has three in the row. The worst guy we could have would be him.
But just jealous?
Ultimately, he went to see Jeb Bush and he was actually afraid of Jeb.
Yeah, you told that story in May. So just jealously eyes...
I don't know what it is. I don't know what it is. You'd have to ask him. But I think he made a fool out of himself he shouldn't have don't it.
Well your supporters are going to stay with you. I don't think there's any doubt about that. He's not going to change their mind. But you need to get on our calculations about 30 million people who are not supporting you now to support you to defeat Hillary Clinton.
I think I'm going to defeat Hillary because we're going to win Michigan. We might win New York. See, when I run, I have a whole different calculus. I have a chance of winning of New York. Nobody else does. We have a big chance of winning New York. We're going to win places like Michigan, I'm going to win Pennsylvania, I'm going to win Ohio. I'm going to win a lot of places, I'm going to win Florida. Florida is my second home. We're going to win places that nobody else is going to win and we're going to add states that nobody else can even think of.
No, it's my job. Come on.
Yes. It's called politics and I'm fine with it. And, if you look at what I've done, I've built an unbelievable company. You know that. I know that. Most of the people know that. And what I'll do is let it be known, I have buildings all over the world, we have jobs, it's going up all over the world. Very few people have built a company like I have built a company.
All right. Are you getting mad at guys like me when you ask negative questions?
No I know you'd become very negative. I do think.
Yeah me?
Yeah.
Why would I do that?
I don't know, who knows. You have to ask your psychiatrist. But I think you become very negative...
Toward you?
Yes. Do you know Melania?
Yes. Your better half.
It's true.
But it's not even close. But I want to get back to this. I think I have been very fair to you, very fair.
You've been fait but I think you get a little bit carried away with yourself, frankly.
Do you want to give me an example?
No, I'm not going to give an example.
Come on.
We're just finished a debate which I hear I just won based on all of the polls again. I won a lot of debates but I really had a good time tonight.
I know you pretty well, though.
And the people, I tell you what. The people but you have to remember, I brought a lot of -- I brought millions of people into the Republican Party. That's why I'm doing so well.
That -- you're right.
That's why we have so many people. But, the best chance of winning is for me to run as a Republican. I will beat Hillary Clinton. These people will not beat Hillary.
OK. So you're going to -- even if they give you the runaround, even if they do bad things to you at the convention, it's possible.
It's always possible. The best chance of winning is to win as a Republican. Run as a Republican, and win. And I am far head of everybody. I'm leading by a lot. I think we're going to do very well over the next two weeks, also. People will be surprised at the amount of victory, the size of the victory. Even you were surprised.
I wasn't surprised. Come on now.
The Super Tuesday...
From the very beginning...
We're going to have other Super Tuesdays.
From the very beginning, I understood your appeal. Yes. Melania. Did you see the numbers on Greta last night for Melania, did you see those numbers?
Were they very good.
Yeah, they were much better than your number.
I'm happy...
So maybe, maybe Melania runs for V.P.
I think that's a good idea.
Look, it's nice of you to lead off the Factor at 11:00. OK. And if I'm unfair, you come on and tell me and give it to me, man.
I will. I promise.
All right. Thank you.
Thank you.
That's right Anderson. Mr. Trump, thank you very much and Mrs. Trump. What do you think of the debate?
I thought it was great. I think they did a very good job. And I thought it was very fair. I actually thought it was going to be tougher. I thought it would be more violent but, it was good. I thought...
Could it be more violent than the what?
Well, I thought it was tough fighting. I though it was going to be worse.
A big moment was when the moderators trying to get you to explain some sort of shifting of positions, the way that they put it.
Well I think I explained it very well, all of you...
Can you tell me where you'll be flexible?
I have people over my life I've known people that are totally inflexible, they go nowhere. You have to have now. With that being said you want to make great deals, not average deals or not in need in the middle, you want to make great deals. But there's nothing wrong with having some flexibility on something.
How -- on what part of your immigration plan do you think you would be...
I think it would be quick to say, frankly right now, I'm very satisfied with what I have. That doesn't mean I wouldn't take it different. I might make it tougher. I mean, to be honest with you, it could be tougher, it's pretty tough but I might make it tougher like...
Then like the wall for example non negotiable?
The wall is going to happen and Mexico is going to pay for the wall. And just like you standing there, you can bank on it.
I can't believe I'm going to ask you this question but, do you realize that you're probably the first person in American history may be even world history to make a joke about your, you know, what on a debate stage?
No, I only made a joke a bout my hands. I have very powerful hand.
Yeah, you went a little further than that.
Look at these hands, aren't they beautiful? I have very powerful hands and large hands, relatively large hands and a politician was said, I didn't have a large hands. It's the first time anyone has ever said that one. So, no, I think it was a very -- I think was a good moment.
What was going through your mind when Ted Cruz said, more than once that you should breath.
Nothing, I didn't even know if he said that, I mean, did he say that? I mean.
Yes.
I really don't know. I don't think Ted had a very good night but I think that and I think we did have a very good night. But I found it to be very interesting. I did not find it to be a stuff as that though.
Let me start with tonight and the debate itself. You -- somebody just said they love you. But I want to ask you this, as you answer the questions, you obviously are the frontrunner so you're going to get most of the fire. You seemed at ease there tonight and it didn't seem to bother you. You went in expecting it, I assume.
I did. I actually thought it was going to be much tougher than it was, Sean. I thought they'd come at me a little bit stronger. They're pretty far down, and I really thought they'd come at me stronger than they did. I actually enjoyed the debate. And I mean, according to "Drudge" and all of these polls, the result was really good, so I'm happy about this.
Last question. This is now, I think, what, the 11th debate that you guys have had. Were you happy with the FOX debate tonight? Are you happy with the debate process? Do you think they're becoming repetitive? Do you think that maybe they have run its course, or do you want to keep doing them?
I thought the moderators did a very good job. I was very happy with the way I performed. I think that now it's getting so repetitive it's ridiculous. I just don't think we need any more debates. I guess we're saddled up with one more. But I really think the moderators were very, very good, the three moderators, and I thought FOX did a very good job tonight.
A lot of people read that as a threat.
No, no, not a threat, not a threat. It's not a threat.
How?
Well, I would like -- I happen to think that when you're fighting an enemy that chops off heads, I happen to think that we should use something that is stronger than we have right now. Right now, basically waterboarding is essentially not allowed, as I understand it.
And you would like it to be, if you could expand it.
I would certainly like it to be, at a minimum, at a minimum, to allow that.
Why do you think we don't have those -- why do you think we don't have waterboarding allowed?
Because we're a weak -- I think we have become very weak and ineffective. I think that's why we're not beating ISIS. It's that mentality.
Isn't that separates us from the savages, rules?
No, I don't think so. We have to beat the savages.
And therefore throw all rules out?
We have beat the savages.
You said I disavow...
So, I said it myself. How many times do I have to reject or disavow?
And you don't want the supporters?
No, I don't want anything. But how many times...
What do you think of white supremacists, by the way?
I don't like any group of hate. Hate groups are not for me. But I have said this before. The press hates me to say it. They just don't want to pick it up.
All right, Mr. Trump, we're going to have leave it there. We have run out of time. Thanks so much.
Thank you very much.
Taxes.
... necessarily...
Yes, I mean, median income is down thousands of dollars, millions more in poverty, on food stamps and out of the labor force.
Right.
I have.
I've been hearing you long before I really knew too much about it. And then, you know, a few years ago, I started really looking. And it was always amazing to me that the politicians didn't -- they hardly even considered it when they were talking about Obamacare. And...
Between energy...
... Obamacare  is just a disaster.
So let me ask this...
Just so you understand...
Yes. I don't want to interrupt you, but you know, because you can also add to your list, I guess, you're conservative on immigration. You're conservative on the issue of people, refugees coming into the country, enhanced interrogation.
Well, I'm the most conservative. Yes. Sure.
I don't mean to laugh...
... the conservative label...
... but it's true.
I know, but it's true. It's, like, you know, you have 19 seconds to speak.
Yes.
... endorse me last week. And he called up. He said, You're the right guy. You're the toughest guy for it. And you know, that's a pretty good thing.
Well, let me ask this...
He's got one of the worst records of voting in history.
It's amazing.
And in a couple of states...
It's massive!
... it was over 100 percent?
Listen...
And instead of the Republicans fighting, Sean, they should say, This is a blessing.
Yes. I agree. All right, Mr. Trump, we're going to see you Wednesday, by the way, in North Carolina.
Good.
Yes, I had a feeling...
I will not -- I will not disappoint them. Believe me.
I had a feeling you'd like that introduction. You know, negativity is something that most people say they hate in a political campaign, and yet, you know what? It works. When we look at polling in Michigan and in Florida, that does seem to be tightening. Do you think it's a direct result of that scathing takedown by Mitt Romney and speeches by Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan and the attacks you're facing from Cruz, Rubio and some super-PACs out there?
Well, I'm the only one that could beat Hillary Clinton and a lot of polls have shown that, frankly, and -- and I'm the one that's going to do the job, I'm the one that's going to bring jobs back to the country. Mitt Romney is a failed candidate. He ran one of the worst presidential campaigns in the history of our country, and now he wants to be relevant again and it's disgraceful...
Mr. Trump, I'd like to ask you about something you've been doing rather recently at your rallies, which is having your supporters raise their right hand and say, "I pledge to vote for Donald Trump." Now, as you know, a still image of that at your rallies has gone around the Internet and some people have been quite disturbed by that image. And in fact, Abe Foxman, who's a holocaust survivor, says it reminds him of the Nazi salute. I wonder how you feel about that comparison and whether it would make you want to perhaps not do it anymore, if people do feel that way?
Well, I think it's ridiculous. I mean, we're having such a great time. Yesterday, I had 20,000 people in Mississippi. I had tremendous crowds in Michigan. And sometimes, we'll do it for fun and they'll say -- they'll start screaming at me, "Do the swear in. Do the swear in." I mean, they're -- they're having such a great time. They're massive crowds. I get, you know, by far the biggest crowds and we're having a good time. Honestly, until this phone call, I didn't know it was a problem. We were all -- you know -- and -- and...
Well, in light of that, does that make you...
I'll tell you what...
... reflect on it?
... almost everybody in the room -- almost everybody in the room raises their hand. We're having a good time. I never knew it was a problem.
Does it bother you?
Certainly, if there's anything -- if it's offensive, if there's anything wrong with it, I wouldn't do it. But when I say, "Raise your hand, " everybody raises their hand. They're screaming to me to do it, "We want to do it." And it's really -- you know, we're all having a lot of fun. I never thought it was anything offensive.
But let's just be clear, though -- so because you now know that it is offensive to some people, will you say, "OK, let's not do this in the future?"
Well, I'll certainly look into it. I mean, I'd like to find out that that's true. But I would certainly look into it because I don't want to offend anybody. But I can tell you that it's been -- it's been amazingly received -- well received. But I will certainly look into that, Matt.
All right. I think that's a fair answer. Mr. Trump, thanks so much for your time this morning.
OK. Thank you very much.
And we're waiting to see what happens tonight Mr. Trump. Thank you for joining us this morning.
OK. Thank you very much.
Good morning.
Good morning. Well, they like me in Michigan, I have to say. And I like them, so let's see what happens.
Well, what do you think is going on with John Kasich closing in?
Well, I think Rubio is really failing badly. He's been a terrible senator, he doesn't show up to vote, and he has some big problems, as you have probably heard. And you know, a lot of people think he's dropping out of the race, so I think that probably helps Kasich a little bit. But Rubio is sinking rapidly, so we'll see what happens.
Right.
I think we'll do very well there.
You did.
And you know, look, they're very nonviolent, that I can tell you.
Thank you, sir.
Very good, that's true. Have a good time. Thank you very much.
Is there a team?
Yes, there is a team. There's not a team. I'm going to be forming a team. I have met with far more than three people, and I will be forming a team at the appropriate time.
What? It's just, I mean, at some point, there have to be people who will stand by your side and take on global strategy, and some ideas that you find important that they bring to the table. Who are these people?
Well, I think Senator Jeff Sessions as an example, who wasn't on board the last time I spoke to you, because he just endorsed me last week, but I think he is a prime example. He is highly respected as senator, and he is somebody I have a lot of respect for. And that would be one to start off it. In addition to that, I'm dealing with numerous other people and I will be making a decision over the fairly short period of time.
All right. So Donald, we -- we've been showing pictures -- we just did it one time. Showing pictures of people raising their hands when you asked them to pledge that they are going to vote for you.
Right.
Yeah.
And the entire place practically, laughing and having a good time, raises their hands. They're just -- they're raising their hand in the form of a vote, not in the form of a salute. That is crazy. That is crazy.
Right. Yeah. Yeah.
I can't believe that's even being posed.
Yeah.
But no, they're spending a lot of money on that.
Yeah.
The good news is I'm up against a senator who frankly is very unpopular in Florida. He doesn't vote, he doesn't go and vote. And I think if he actually ran for an office there, he wouldn't be elected as dog catcher, honestly.
Well, you -- if -- if they -- if they take this from you at a convention, will you run as an independent?
I don't know, Joe. I don't even want to think about it now. I mean, to be honest, I'm the front runner by quite a bit. CNN had me at 49 the other day, 49 to 15, I think 15 and 15 for the two of these guys. I hear Rubio is getting out. There was big stories all over the place that Rubio is getting out. I don't know if he's getting out. He probably should. He hasn't won hardly anything. He probably should get out and he's not popular. I mean, he's not popular in his own state. He's taken -- he's really defrauded his own people because he said he was going to be a senator and he doesn't go and vote.
Really quickly, Mark Halperin.
So you know, we'll see what happens.
Mr. Trump, in 2014, what was your effective tax rate and how much did you give to charity?
Well, I gave a lot of money to charity. I could release a list. I don't talk about my tax rate because I'm under audit but when the audit's finished, I'll give you my tax returns. I have also filed full financials with the Federal Elections Commissions and it's almost 100 pages, so you have my full financials talking about all of the things you have to talk about, including worth and all of those things, cash flows, worth, very little debt, tremendous cash flow, great company, some of the greatest assets in the world, which frankly you can't learn about from a tax return. You can't learn -- honestly, you can't learn very much from a tax return, almost -- frankly, almost nothing. But I filed my financial statements with the Federal Elections Commission.
All right. Donald Trump, thank you. I should mention you are set to join us live again tomorrow, so we look forward to that. Good to have you on this morning. Appreciate it. Also...
OK. Thank you very much.
Sir, can you hear us?
Yes, I can, Chris. Good morning.
So...
You know, I just have -- in fact, Paul O'Neill, the great Yankee, endorsed me last night. I didn't even know he was at the room. He was at the press conference. I said, "Paul, will you endorse me?" He said, "I love you. I'm going to endorse you." So I -- you know, Paul is from Ohio and Paul was -- you talk a great champion, that guys was great. Solid as a rock. And...
You're not going to get any argument out of me about Paul O'Neill...
I have one of the great hotels of the world. So -- so I mean, I have -- I have great places that we're going to. North Carolina is going to be, I think, fantastic.
It is -- it is disheartening, to say the least.
... for the Democrats.
But isn't there a message in that, Mr. Trump?
I think it'll be a nice -- a nicer, softer, lighter debate, I hope.
Well, how do you take advantage of that? Because if the message of what happened last night is look, people don't want to see their feelings rejected by just telling them they're wrong to feel a certain way, in this case, about Donald Trump. Is it time for you to actually be that change? Ironically, I mean, many people look at you as the person who set the tone of negativity in this race. Is it time for you to say, you know, what? Enough with the negative. Stop attacking me. I'm not going to attack you. We need to unite. We need to be something better.
Well, Chris, I didn't set the tone of negativity. What I did was I fought back. I mean, they were -- they attacked me viciously and I fought back. And don't forget, we started with 17 people. So you know, I've been doing this now for a while. And the nice part is everybody that's attacked me so far has gone down. Wouldn't that be nice for our country because we don't win anymore as a country. So wouldn't that be nice to have somebody that could do that? But every single person, I mean...
Paul, really?
That's what we should be doing, Chris. We should be talking and unifying because I'll tell you what, with all of the new people that have come into the Republican Party and that have come to vote, you know, during all of these -- during this last session, I mean, it's been incredible. During -- during the primaries, with all of these people that have come in, we have something that's special. We have something that the Democrats can't beat us. The only way they're going to beat us...
I know you have a...
... if we keep fighting so stupidly.
I know you have a busy morning, but you just said something very tantalizing, here. This is such a big moment as you head into this debate tomorrow night. The party has to make a decision about whether or not if you have the most if they embrace you as that. Now, one of the big pieces of conflict is how you'll deal with the power structure. You talking about Paul Ryan, you know, you got a little sideways with him last week when you said Ryan's got a big problem if he doesn't do what I say. It's interesting and news-worthy to hear you...
But that wasn't meant as a threat.
... spoke with him and had a good conversation.
Chris, that wasn't meant as a threat.
Give me a taste of that conversation with Paul Ryan.
That was just that they'll lose...
Before you have to go.
... because I have so many people that they'll lose. You know, I mean, it wasn't meant as a threat.
That's the -- that's the trick for you right now. You've convinced the people within your party. Now, you have to convince the party structure itself. We'll be watching that. Tomorrow night is a big night. You had a big night last night. Thank you for speaking to us first here on New Day. You're always welcome to talk about what matters here.
Thank you very much, Chris. I appreciate it. Thank you.
We've all been talking about it this morning. Why did you decide to bring out all of your products last night?
Well because, you know, I filed a lot of papers, over 100 pages with the Federal Elections Commission and it talked about what a great company I've built. And it's truly a great company, a massive company, and everybody was very impressed with it. Otherwise, believe me, you would have been reading about it and writing about it, I can tell you. And when Mitt Romney got up and said steaks, which we have, wines and all of the different things, I have the largest winery in the East Coast and it does tremendous business, the magazine, I have a magazine that's morphed into this magazine that's absolutely incredible.
But Donald, this is what I don't understand, though. You just got off of a massive electoral victory. You won Mississippi, you crushed everybody.
I know, but I like to set the record straight, Joe --
What's wrong with asking a spokesperson to do that?
I think it's very dishonest and I like to -- I sold the airline. I mean, what's wrong with selling an airline?
There's no moment you have to respond to every attack.
And you know what, Joe, it took me three minutes and I set the record straight.
It was longer than three minutes.
I don't like that.
Mika thinks it's smart.
Yes.
We've been talking about Marco Rubio. You had a great night last night. Marco Rubio, not so much. And he has some decisions to make. Would you ever consider him as your running mate?
Well, I don't want to say that now, Mika. He has a big decision to make and he should make his own decision. And you know, I have always liked him and then he really hit me very, very hard and somehow it didn't work --
Well could you forgive him for hitting you and pick him as vice president?
But I will tell you, I got along with him great until a few weeks ago when he started playing Don Rickles. And you know, it was very surprising to see and he was out of character and --
Would you consider him, though, as a vice president?
You know, I became very nasty about it and I guess he's really got a decision to make. I know what you're talking about, I just don't want to be involved in his decision. His decision is a personal one and --
Since you need help with Hispanic voters, since you need help with the Republican establishment, could Marco Rubio, as your vice president, be a bridge to that Republican establishment?
Well, I think this. I think if he runs and loses and, you know, I don't think he would win right now, but if he runs and loses I think he will never be able to do anything very big politically in Florida. I don't think he would be considered by anybody as a vice president and I don't think he could ever run for governor or whatever he might want to run for in the future. So I think running and losing would be risky. But again, that's his decision. I think it has to be his decision 100 percent.
But I'm asking you, though, if he drops out before losing Florida would you consider him, could he possibly be on the list as a vice president of yours because he could help outreach to Hispanics and help your outreach to the establish.
Sure. And he's got a lot of talent. I just don't want to say that yet, Joe. It's too -- It's just not appropriate to talk about it until he makes a decision. I have respect for him, he's got great talent and I just don't want to say that yet. It's too soon.
Thank you. Congratulations. Quite a run of victories.
Thank you, Bob. Bob, I still remember when you were up in my office many years ago and that was still an honor. It was a great honor, believe me. A long time ago.
Well OK. Yeah Carl Bernstein and I came and interviewed you after your book "The Art of the Deal."
That's right.
I want to ask about the wall you're going to get Mexico to build. We were talking about this earlier and a number of my colleagues here say you really haven't answered the question how you're going to do that. And you know from business somebody can have a good idea but how are they going to do it? And can you give us some idea?
OK. Great question, Bob. Sure. OK. Look, the wall. First of all, Mexico is not going to build it, we're going to build it. And it's going to be a serious wall. It's not going to be a toy wall like we have right now where cars and trucks drive over it loaded up with drugs and they sell the drugs in our country and then they go back and, you know, we get the drugs, they get the cash, OK, and that's not going to happen.
Right. How are you going to get them to pay for it?
We're going to build a wall and Mexico is going to pay. And the reason they're going to pay and the way they're going to pay, Bob, is this. We have a trade deficit now with Mexico of $58 billion a year. The wall is going to cost $10 billion a year. That's what it's going to cost. It's going to be a powerful wall. It's going to cost $10 billion. Now --
But they're a sovereign nation.
When you're losing -- or essentially losing -- but when you're losing $58 billion a year on trade -- in addition to that we give subsidies for Mexico. Believe me, I have all the cards. Now will a politician be able to do it? No because they don't know how to negotiate. That's how we have the Iran deal where we give them $150 billion and other things. But for me that's a hundred percent, Bob, and you can hold me to it and you will hold me to it.
Just suppose they won't do it. Would you --
We pay a subsidy. Money coming over the border, they're -- there are so many ways that Mexico makes money with us, Bob. There are so many different ways, five in particular, that we will take it out of there.
All right. Very good, Donald.
That nobody else could add but me.
Mr. Trump, there have been incidents --
Hi, Cokie.
Hi, Mr. Trump. There have been incidents of children, white children, pointing to their darker skinned classmates and saying you'll be deported when Donald Trump is president. There have been incidents of white kids at basketball games holding up signs to teams which have Hispanic kids on them saying we're going to build a wall to keep you out. Are you proud of that? Is that something you've done in American political and social discourse that you're proud of?
Well, I think your question is a very nasty question. And I'm not proud of it because I didn't even hear of it, OK? And I certainly do not like it all when I hear about it. I have -- You're the first one that's told me about that. But I am --
It's been reported in many newspapers.
I would not be proud of that at all and that's not what the purpose of it is. We want to make America great again. We want to bring back our industry, we want to bring back our jobs from China and Japan, and by the way Mexico, which has taken so many of our jobs. And that's what it's about. I have not heard about these incidences.
When you talk about deporting people and you talk about building a wall and you talk about banning Muslims, doesn't that have an effect --
I talk about deporting people that are here illegally, OK?
-- on children? Doesn't that have an --
And I also talk about people coming in, Cokie.
-- effect on the whole discourse?
I talked about deporting people that are here illegally. They're here illegally. We either have a country or we don't. I talked about deporting people that are here illegally.
But what about the effect on children?
I also talk -- Cokie, I also talk about building a wall and oftentimes I'll say, and there's going to be a big beautiful door in that wall and people are going to come into our country because we want people to come in. We want people to come into our country, but we want them to come in legally.
But what about the children, Mr. Trump? What about what the children are hearing from you and how they are responding to it?
Well, I think people are responding very positively.
Children, I asked.
I think the messages are very positive. You know, "Make America great again " is a very positive message. It's not a negative message. And that's why --
Unless you think America's great already. And a lot of people think America --
No, I think America is -- right now -- very, very troubled. I think we're being laughed at all over the world. I think that if you look at our military, we can't beat ISIS, General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave right now, Cokie. We can't beat ISIS, OK? I think that our veterans are not taken care of, they're treated worse than illegal immigrants, by the way, you want to talk about a problem.
You've had a good many veterans against you.
Our educational system is at the bottom of the heap worldwide. We're doing horribly with education and yet we're No. 1 in cost per pupil. Yeah, I think we have a lot of problems. Obamacare is a disaster, it's got to be repealed and replaced. It's a disaster. People are -- Obamacare has not worked. It's going to die of its own volition, but it's better if it gets terminated and if we come up with something. And no -- We have -- If you say America's great right now, America is a very troubled, a very, very troubled nation right now, Cokie, and we -- on top of it all, we owe $19 trillion.
All right. We're being told that you've got to go to a follow-up interview, Cokie Roberts may want to come to your office and interview you more -- for extended remarks, as well. Let me ask you, though, in closing. Donald, obviously all eyes are on Florida and Ohio over the next seven days. What are your plans and what do you project wins in both of those winner-take-all states?
Well, I think we're going to do well. I'm in Florida now. It's my second home. I have tremendous -- I have thousands of employees in Florida and it's a great state and I think I'm going to do great -- in Ohio likewise, I've -- you know, I've lived in Ohio for a couple of seasons and it's a fantastic place where I have so many friends and they're all enthused and all excited. Paul O'Neal, the great Yankee last night, was at the meeting. I didn't even know that. And he stood up and he endorsed me and having Paul O'Neal endorse me, he was such a solid guy, such a great ball player, such a solid guy. And I think -- he's from Ohio. I think we're going to do great in Ohio.
As most candidates are. We appreciate it. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Huge night last night. Do you have any idea that you were going to win as big as you did?
Well, I felt good. I mean, Mississippi, I was in three or four times and it was like a lovefest. And so, I felt very good about it. Michigan has been great. It has been great for me for a long time. I have so many friends there. I had no idea it would be that big.
Do you think it's the message on trade in particular in Michigan that was effective? Sanders winning as well there. You have a very similar message.
I think they want strength. I think they want military. I think they want to take care of vets. I think they hate Obamacare. But I would say ultimately it's about jobs and the economy. And you know, Michigan has been stripped. You look at those empty factories all over the place. And nobody hits that's message better than me. I'm going to take care of it. I'm going to stop it. I'm going to stop the craziness that is going on. If you look at what's happening, how -- even today, I mean, we're just shipping company after company after company is leaving this country and leaving jobs behind. And I'm going to get it stopped.
Two new polls out today. Quinnipiac, also a CNN one both showing essentially the same thing. You are way ahead here in Florida. Almost I think 2-1 against Rubio. And even in Ohio leading Kasich with six points and seven points in each poll. If you win Florida and Ohio, is it over?
I think so. I think if I win those two, I think it's over. I thought Kasich said after Michigan he was going to drop out, to be honest with you. He was saying that he will win Michigan, he will win it easily. And he --
He is now saying Ohio. If he doesn't win Ohio --
And I was saying Ohio. But no, he said Michigan. He said, you know, it's his neighbor. And he said he is going to win Michigan, and he was pretty confident of Michigan. And I thought he said he was going to drop out if he lost Michigan. I guess he's not going to do that. So I think we are going to do very well in Ohio. I know Ohio very well. I have many, many friends.
You think you'll win there?
Well, even Paul O'Neill of the Yankees endorsed me. He is from Ohio. Great guy. And he endorsed me last night at the press conference. I think I'll win Ohio, yes. And I think, I mean, we just have better policies. The country is sick and tired of what they are seeing. The country is sick and tired of these politicians that's talk and to all talk, no action. And they are all tired of it, Anderson.
So if Kasich drops -- if you win Ohio, Kasich drops out and out you win Florida and Rubio is gone and it's just you and Cruz, if you don't get all of the delegates needed to win by the convention --
Well, I think if I win Ohio and if I win Florida, pretty much, you're going to be pretty much assured of doing that.
You think you'll get all the delegates?
I think so, yes. I really think so. I don't see the convention going that route. I see probably getting the delegates. You know, it is like the fighters. That's the ultimate way of doing it. You knock them out. If you knock them out, nothing can happen.
You want to go for knockout?
I would rather go for a knockout.
I have heard that.
Puts down the Bible and then he lies. I have never seen a man lie this much. But even --.
You think for a guy who says he is very religious, you are surprise?
No, Ted. I call him Lyin' Ted. He is Lyin' Ted. And you know, that's his name. And I think frankly that name has stuck because the evangelicals are on my side. They don't like liars. Evangelicals do not like liars.
So if it goes to convention, you don't have -- you are a couple short or couple hundred short, for you, that doesn't matter. It's got to be you as the nominee? No other deal is acceptable?
I think this. If you go to the convention and because of some artificial number that they said, if you go to the convention and you are leading by a lot of delegates, I think you should get the nomination. And that will be me. I'll have far more delegates. Now, whether I get to that artificial number, I don't know, but I think I will.
You've had a lot of money thrown against you in just these last couple of weeks.
This never been anything like it.
So what do you think was Rubio's demise?
I think he tried to be Don Rickles, frankly. He wanted to be Don Rickles and he's not Don Rickles. And it took me by surprise. I mean, I'm standing at one of the debates and all of a sudden, he got nasty. He was very nasty.
Did he get under your skin?
No, he didn't. Nobody gets under my skin. I mean, you have to handle it. But he was really rude. And, in fact, for a while, I wasn't even sure if what I was seeing was right. Then he had a horrible debate with Chris Christie where he folded. I mean, he totally choked. And you know the expression. Once a choker, always a choker.
Do you think going after you, you know, with jokes, with humor, with insults, that took him off his message?
I think so. He wasn't only joking. I mean, he was insulting and, you know, made up insults, a nasty insults.
And it weakened him do you think in a long term?
It turned out to. I didn't know it would. I mean, I think I hit him very hard. I probably hit him much harder. But maybe for me it's more natural. It wasn't natural for him. And took him off his game. Amazing, I've never seen anything like it. And he went from being, you know, from doing pretty good to now he is at the bottom of the pack.
I want to ask you about Cruz in a minute. But just in a big picture, have you given much thought to how you want to define the GOP? I mean, you will be not only the nominee, you will be standard bearer for the Republican Party. How do you want to redefine the GOP?
OK. Well, I think the biggest story in all of politics, all over the world right now -- I've been on the cover of "Time " magazine four times in the last short number of months -- I mean, because of what's happening. There's a movement. And it's millions and millions of people that are disgusted with the incompetence of our politicians and our leaders, if you want to call them that. I don't even call them that. I hate to use it.
Republicans and Democrats?
Republicans and Democrats. And I'll get to the Republicans in a second because they are blown a great opportunity. So you have primaries. And millions of people more are going to the primaries and voting. And in all fairness, it's because of me. I'm not going to joke. It's not because of Ted Cruz who nobody cares about. Millions of people are going to the polls. More people than did four years ago and did ever. By the way, ever. You report on it. Millions of people, it's the biggest story. And people come up to me, Mr. Trump, when I'm signing autographs or shaking hands. Mr. Trump, 50 years old, 60 years old, I've never voted before, but I'm so proud to be voting.
So you want a more populist GOP?
No, no, I'll tell you what. I'm a conservative person. I don't think the labels matter. You know they say he is not -- Jeb Bush used to say he is not a conservative, OK. He is not a conservative. I say, what difference does it make? I mean, who cares? I have very conservative views. But one view that probably isn't considered conservative, but is it smart trade. I want smart trade.
Your position is actually similar to Bernie Sanders in some way. I mean, you are both --
Except I can do something about it. The difference between Sanders and I, I watched him recently. And he is right about one thing. The world is ripping us off on trade. It has been a horrible thing. It has been horrible, horrible experiment. I have been against it for years. You know, if you look back, I have been against it your friend Wolf Blitzer actually did a tape of his interviews with me from like 15, 17 years ago. And I was saying the same thing, a little bit different nations like Japan who is really ripping us off.
But your position is pretty un-Republican. I mean, Larry Kudlow who, you know, is positive about your corporate tax policy, he's critical of you on trade. He says that essentially it's going to be raising prices for people on consumer goods, on electronics, on cars and other items. And it's essentially a tax on people who can't afford it.
No, I have heard Larry. And let me tell you what's going to happen from a practical standpoint, from a negotiating standpoint. The world is ripping us off because of manipulation, monetary manipulation, devaluations, OK. They are great. The greatest player of them all is China. Nobody has ever played the valuation game with their currency better. It's currency devaluation, than China. China is a grand master. Japan is doing very well. But some of these countries are just absolute masters at it. When we start getting tough, and they think that we're serious, and I'm totally serious. I would put a tax on it in two seconds.
You talk about a 45 percent tax --
I've talked about different taxes. I have also said -- I didn't say I was going to put. I said use it as a negotiating tool, and I would if we couldn't make the right deal.
But that would raise prices for consumer goods.
China just devalued their currency recently more than they have at any time in more than two decades. This was like shocking. And the only reason they did it is because we're weak and have no leadership. It makes it impossible for our companies to compete with Chinese companies and China generally, OK. It makes it absolutely impossible. The threat of me doing this, for instance, the threat of doing it against Japan or China, tell Japan, by the way, when your cars come in you are going to have to pay a 35 percent tax. I sued 35 percent. I only used 45 if somebody is really egregious and, of course, now you have many people that are really egregious.
So you are seeing this as a negotiation tactic?
Absolutely. And you know what is going to happen? When they see that we are not playing games, that we are really do because I would do it in a heartbeat. I would love to do it. When they see that we are not playing games, they are going to stop playing with their currencies and they are going to stop taking our jobs to the extent that they are taking them right now.
You do worry a lot of people, obviously, in the Republican establishment, though. You know this better than anybody and I know you don't like the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll. A new one just came out today and saying the majority of the American voters, six in ten, saying you are harming the GOP's image. Two-thirds have a negative impression of you. How do you go about bringing the GOP back together?
Look, first of all, millions of people now are voting more as we just said, more than they were four year ago, eight years ago, 16 years ago. Millions and millions of people. They would never see anything like it. I was in South Carolina and a woman came up who was at the polling. She said, you know, Mr. Trump, I've done this for 24 years. I've never seen anything like it.
I want to ask you about Ted Cruz. You talked about the importance, you know, you and I talked about the importance of being flexible.
He's totally inflexible.
Cruz says flexibility is Washington code word for he is getting ready to stick it to the voters. What is flexibility to you? On what can you work?
It's negotiation.
So you can work with Democrats?
Hey, I wrote "the art of the deal." OK.
So Donald Trump as president reaches out to Democrats and Republicans?
Well, that's the way it was set up, Anderson.
So those are all things you can make compromises on with Democrats to get something done?
Of course you can. Of course you can. You can't be inflexible. Look, if somebody wants to sell this house and they want a billion dollars. I want a billion dollars. You have to negotiate a little bit. OK.
So the other knock that, you know, because some conservatives make, certainly to make on President Obama. They say he is sort of an imperial president. It's one of the things Cruz is saying about you. Even these are the pledge that you are having people make at rallies. He says that you're -- they're treating your supporters like subjects to a king. The implication being as president you would be...
It's just words. Look, it's just words. Ted, it's just words with Ted. Ted is a guy who's somebody he's a very inflexible guy who never -- he'll never make a deal. You talk about gridlock now. If Ted Cruz became president you wouldn't have anything done and Washington would be a total piece of stone. You wouldn't make any -- just I understand you know, he talks about he's a constitutionalist. OK, the constitution was set up with senators and congressmen and you are supposed to work and make deals.
Do you see the constitution...
And two parties. And it could be more than two parties but two parties.
Do you see the constitution as a living breathing document that -- or do you see that something set in stone from long ago? Those are sort of...
I see the constitution as set in stone. I see it as one of the great documents of all time. I also see it as something that says you're going to sit down and make deals. I mean look, if Ted wants something, health care and he won't negotiate, the other side is not going to negotiate either. There is going to be a little bit of movement. And that's wrong.
And that's key to you to end gridlock in transition?
Yeah, but I'm going to make a better deal on the other side.
All right.
I'm going to make a better deal.
On foreign policy. Is there -- and maybe you've been running a campaign. Have you started thinking about a -- sort of a Trump doctrine when for using foreign power overseas. What criteria do you look that?
First of all, there can be no doctrine because everything is different. Every situation is different. And I didn't want to go into Iraq and I'll say it 100 times. I didn't want to go, you know, there is way you were on Howard Stern's show years. You know, before it ever happened. And if he asked me that question and he's a friend of mine. He's a good guy actually, much different than you see on radio. Believe me.
It's a great interview.
H is a great guy. But Howard asked me and I said, "Well, I don't know." That's was the first time it was ever asked. But don't forget I'm an entrepreneur. They don't ask me about me simply going into Iraq at that time? And this was long before we went in. And you could see that I was very hesitant. That's was like I wish I go in. Look...
Do you think your...
And besides that. Iraq did not knock down the world trade center. Just in case you had any questions.
Do you think Islam is at war with the west?
I think Islam hates us. There is something -- there is something there that is a tremendous hatred there. There's a tremendous hatred. We have to get to the bottom of it. There's an unbelievable hatred of us.
In Islam itself?
You're going to have to figure that out. OK. You'll get another Pulitzer, right? But you'll have to figure that out. But there's a tremendous hatred. And we have to be very vigilant. We have to be very careful. And we can't allow people coming into this country who have this hatred of the United States.
I guess the question is...
And of people that are not Muslim.
The San Bernardino killer?
The bottom line is they killed 14 people. They gave them baby showers. I mean, they were friends of theirs and they walked in and they killed them. There's unbelievable hatred. You look at Paris, 138 people killed. Many, many people are going to die in the hospital. Mortally wounded, horribly wounded, horribly wounded. And they walk into a room and boom, boom, boom. There's a sickness going on that's unbelievable. And honestly, you have to get to the bottom of it.
You talked about going after the families of terrorists. You now reversed that essentially...
I didn't reverse anything.
You would still want to go after the families of terrorists?
No, no, no. I didn't reverse anything.
You would still want to go after the families of terrorists?
No, no, I didn't reverse anything. I clarified very simply we have laws. We have to obey the laws. Now there must have to be one what
During the candidate of church would be against the law.
I didn't say kill. We have to go after them. The family knows would have terrorists in that
Where you said the other day we have to play the game, you said we got to play the game the way they play the game.
We have to play the game at a much tougher level that were plan.
What does that mean though?
We have to expand those laws.
Does that mean cutting off heads?
No, it doesn't mean that but we have to expand the laws luck.
What is explains the laws?
Anderson, lets me explain something we are playing at this level and they don't care. They have no rules. And we have these rules that are very onerous. I mean our military is got brought in because...
When you say increase the laws and do more than waterboarding, what is that specifically?
I'll work it with the generals. I'll work wit the generals.
I talked to General Michael Hayden.
For sure he says it's terrible that we talk that way. And, you know, what that's why he's been fighting this war for many years. OK.
He is the Four-Star General Former CIA. Fomer Head of the CIA., he says sharing foreign policy ideas are frightening.
Oh, yeah I know well, his, he frightens me because we've been fighting ISIS for many years and this shouldn't have taken -- this should have been over with quickly. So that's the problem we have these people that are frightened because I'm protecting chaos.
Yeah, you did.
OK.
So when you say so are you still in support of waterboarding and more?
I'm in total support of waterboarding. It going to be within the law but I have to expand the law because a lot of people think it's not within the law now because of this administration. So they are allowed to chop off heads and we aren't allowed to waterboard. Somehow we're at a big disadvantage. I will tell you that right now.
On a -- yeah.
And, again I was going to give you the analogy. So they are sitting around having dinner. They believe it or not, even though they chop off heads and even though do they drown people, and they are talking. Can you imagine the conversation when they are talking about how weak and soft and pathetic we are and they go out and chop off people's heads? OK. They can't believe it. They can believe it.
I asked about...
The fact is, just in a nutshell, we have to be much tougher. If we're going to beat ISIS, we have to be much tougher than we are. When you have General Hayden saying, "Oh, that's so terrible the way Trump is talking, " that's why we're losing.
I got to ask you. I watched the press conference you gave last night. The victory speech. Obviously huge night for you. Just a couple factual things. The steaks you showed, those aren't Trump steaks, right?
Oh, no they are Trump. No I buy them. I'm not going to kill the cow.
No but they aren't sold those are because...
No, no, we sell excuse me.
For showing this thing was to fight back in Flint and Mitt Romney said about...
No, no just I understand Trump steaks. We sell the steaks through my clubs. I have many clubs and hotels. So we sell this cow...
But they aren't sold at Sharper Image. They are not
Oh no, they are sold differently.
That business is gone.
No, no it's the same thing. It's an offshoot of it. I mean it's the same thing. We have, we do a tremendous steak business.
Because those steaks weren't bought locally from a meat supplier?
No, no. We buy a lot of steaks from different places. I don't want to but if I'm in California, I don't want to buy my steaks in New York.
So those steaks you sell...
...we sale the steaks, and largely, to our hotels and our clubs and things like that. You know, it's a small business..
And the magazine, you showed up, that's not the Trump magazine that Mitt Romney was talking out?
I've had many magazines. Every time I open a business, I'll sometimes open a magazine for a period of a year and get the business started and then close it.
If people were pointing out today saying, "Oh, look, the items you were showing last night, in order to push back against Mitt Romney, you know, the implication was those are Trump steaks available nationwide somewhere they're not."
...where they are available nationwide. You can buy them at different places that I own. I own many, many places.
You can buy them if you eat in your restaurant here somewhere?
Yeah.
You can't go on the internet and buy them.
The magazine, that magazine has been with me for a long time and you've morphed it in.
But that's not the Trump magazine that Romney was talking about.
...many magazines when I start a business, and I keep it open for a year or two until the business gets going. And after the building, if business gets going, you close it up. It's like a loss leader, because frankly, you don't make any money with these magazines.
Do you think they'll going to start to coalesce around you?
... every one of those, I'm the only one can beat Hillary and I'll beat her easily. I'll bring in Michigan, I may bring in New York. You know, we always talk about the path. You know, the path is much tougher for a Republican, you do understand that structurally. Because if they lose Ohio, it's over, If they lose Pennsylvania, they loose Florida, it's over. But I'll bring in states along the other. First of all, I'll win in Florida.
Will you debate Cruz if it's one on one?
Yeah, that's fine.
You would do a debate with Cruz....
I don't think he's a good debater. I think he's -- frankly, the way I look at Ted, I think it's very phony. I think Ted is actually a bad talker, pretty good debater, bad talker, can't talk. I don't mind debating him at all. The problem is when I debate somebody, then people say, I'm not a nice person. But they say you won the debate.
So, bottom line, tomorrow night you're expecting a different tone, but you'll be ready for anything?
... be softer, but I'll be ready. I mean, you know, I think that Marco is going to be a different person. Marco has been, you know, mortally wounded. You know, question is, will Marco even be there? I hope he makes the right decision. I'm not going to make the decision for him. But Marco has been, you know, pretty, badly wounded. It will be interesting to see what happens. Kasich is interesting, because he said he's going to win Michigan and he lost. He said he's going to win, I mean, he said it to you. I think I watched him on your show.
He never came out and said he'd win. But, he said, he thought he would do very well.
...said, he would Michigan. He didn't even come in second. OK. So, you know, I mean, I was of the impression if he didn't win Michigan -- I'm not talking about Ohio, I'm talking about Michigan. If he didn't win Michigan, he would drop out. He came in third. OK. He didn't even come in second. So, it'll be interesting to see what he says. And Ted is Ted. I mean, we've been playing the game now for a long time. These debates to me are getting very boring, if you want to know the truth.
Mr. Trump, thank you.
Have a good time.
Grab a seat. Wow.
This is a big deal.
Thanks for being -- all right, you are maybe one week away. If you were to win Florida and Ohio, and polls show that -- the RealClearPolitics average is about -- you're plus-18 in Florida.
Right.
He was on my T.V. show. He and I had a big fight.
Oh. OK, well, I...
You don't expect he's going to write a check, but what you're saying is that they will have to make concessions.
Well, there's many different ways.
So in other words, you don't expect Mexico to say...
No. No.
... Yes, Mr. Trump, here's a check for $10 billion.
Because politically, it's not feasible. It wouldn't look good.
Want me to tell it?
Yes. Go ahead.
What do we do -- every time you look at the equation -- all right, you got discretionary spending, and then we have Social Security and Medicare, the third rail.
Right. Right.
Would you consider raising the retirement age? Would you consider maybe getting rid of cost of living benefits...
I am...
You don't think we'll have to cut entitlements?
I don't want to cut entitlements, no. I don't want to...
All right, so let me then...
I don't want to cut entitlements.
... trillions of dollars...
Corporate inversion.
... and you talk about -- corporate inversions, repatriating the money...
Right.
We have Obamacare.
Right.
But you'll replace it with health savings accounts...
Absolutely.
... with competition and portability.
Absolutely.
You can take it job to job.
You can take it from place to place.
And more.
No, no. And more.
And more.
People are absolutely getting killed. So it won't exist in 2017. It'll explode. It'll blow up.
... if you stub your toe.
The thing with Obamacare  is the young people aren't joining. And the people that they really want to pay for other people that do have difficulty -- I mean, you know, preexisting and difficulties -- those people aren't joining. The people with difficulties are all joining. And it's just not working.
All right...
It never was going to work. It never had a chance to work.
All right.
... because they happen to be on FOX, many of them.
Pound the host, all right.
They even said...
All right.
-- that was a...
Last...
-- and so many other things...
Last night, you said something...
And they would be so foolish, Sean, to give it away.
I agree with you.
Millions of people, they would be so foolish to throw that away.
When you see the numbers and the percentages, this percentage increase on the Republican side, clearly, the energy is there.
Yes.
On the Democratic side, it is depressed. It's down 35...
Thirty-five percent down.
... 40 percent.
Right.
So last night, you talked about reconciliation. You talked about unity. You talked about bringing the party together, electing Republican senators and congressmen, and even conversations with Paul Ryan. Bring us in that conversation. How are -- how are these people...
All right...
You said something else last night...
And others -- and by the way, and others.
All right...
No, no, Sean...
But I see after -- after you've had victories and you hold these press conferences...
Right.
That's what they do all the time.
... especially with Paul on entitlements. Remember the famous wheelchair over the cliff and all.
So you're saying this is a preview of coming attractions.
No, no, I'm just saying we're going to win. I'm just saying we're going to win.
Yes.
Yes, so far.
Yes.
We're going to keep it that way folks, OK?
You'd put education back to the states completely?
Yes, 100 percent.
Is there anything that you think you're liberal on?
Not liberal. I mean, but I am common sense. Look, here's the one thing that the conservatives can get me -- free trade. I'm a free trader, just so you understand. But free trade has to go along with the word smart trade. I don't want to be a free trader, you know, it's free on our side, but on their side, they're killing us, OK? Like China. And I have great relationships with China. And I made a lot of money in China. I've made a fortune in China dealing with China. And I don't blame China. I blame our leaders. I wish our leaders were doing -- they -- they currency manipulate greater than anybody in the history of the world.
So then here's my question. So every time your opponents are attacking you, are they attacking your old positions and not --
They like to attack the old positions and they also say I'm not a free trader. Let me tell you --
So this is my --
I love free trade --
-- here's my other question.
We don't have the capability. Our leaders aren't smart enough to deal with the other leaders. These guys in China, in Mexico, in Japan, these are total killers. These are smart, smart people. They stay awake at night thinking about what to do, whereas Obama is out playing golf, OK?
OK.
So my -- and my -- and my sons are members of the NRA.
If all of -- do you pledge -- I guess for those people that write me on Twitter and Facebook and say Hannity, you're too nice to Mr. Trump and you don't challenge him on his conservatism, are -- is it your promise and pledge that everything you just listed, energy independence, cutting the budget, the penny plan, the military, the borders -- hang on. If everything you're saying, is that a promise and a pledge? This is you.
That's a pledge. You know why it's a pledge?
No.
And I wouldn't do that if I thought --
You think that's the main thing that --
Well, no --
Let me ask you --
-- it's draining --
One other issue comes up.
Sean, it's draining our country. It's draining our country.
I agree with you. I'm not disagreeing.
And you know what? If we had smart leaders -- the problem with free trade is you need smart leaders on your side, too. And we don't have those people. But Carl Icahn, the smartest people in the world are in our country, business leaders. I have them lined up. I have Carl Icahn.
You have --
I have Steve Wynn is so incredible. He's a smart guy.
Steve?
You know Steve.
Yes.
Phil Ruffin, Andy Beal, one of the greatest bankers in the world. These are super brilliant guys, make so much money when the market goes bad. He always gets it right when it goes good, he gets it right. I have the smartest people in the world. They're ready to come and help. We use political hacks to negotiate our deals and we lose all the time.
Oh, boy, here we go.
But let me just tell you where you're wrong.
Now I feel like Chris Christie. Go ahead.
Even the people on the stage, like -- like Ted Cruz. You know I mean, I will tell you, they are controlled by the donors. They are controlled by the special interests.
I don't disagree with you.
They are controlled --
But if you're president --
-- and I'm self-funding. I'm putting up my own money.
All right.
But, but, Sean, these guys are all controlled by the special interests, 100 percent. I mean look, I was there. I was a member of the establishment nine months ago, right? I was -- who was better at it than me? I was great at it. But I also saw it was wrong. And politicians will do what's right for the people that gave them the money, not what's right for the country.
I have 30 seconds.
Right. Let me tell you, Sean, I don't think we need an earthquake. We need -- we need intelligence, we need energy, we don't have energy. We need certain things. We don't need the word "revolution." It's not going to be a revolution. We are going to make our country so great and so smart and so strong and we don't need the -- I mean the words, the words you used are beautiful words, but honestly, we're going to do it with less than that. We are going to do everything that you said, but it's not the word "revolution."
You told -- he's the head of Vets for Trump.
Great guy.
Yes, sir. Congratulations.
Thank you.
So, I was really struggling. I was in San Antonio for six years, over 100 surgeries just to -- just to be this way.
OK.
I want you to work for us.
That's right.
Do you think it played to your advantage?
I think so. Look, the other is the other. If somebody hits, we hit back. And I think that's true in life. That's true in running countries. It's true in running businesses. But I just found this to be a very elegant evening. And everybody did a very good job.
There are a couple points of contrast up there on the stage tonight. One was what -- I guess you could basically call it the all versus some argument about Islam. You, as you'll remember, spoke to Anderson; and you had there's a hatred coming from Islam towards the United States.
No doubt about it.
The criticism is but not from all Muslims. You understand the sensitivity to it. You call it political correctness. The counter is that it's just correctness. What do you want to say now?
I don't want to say anything. I've answered the question. I've answered it many times. There's a great hatred, and we have to get to the bottom of it.
The concern is that you wind up painting with too broad a brush. You said in the past you hire Muslims, you have Muslim friends. You're not saying they're part of the hatred, right?
I do, but there's a lot of -- you look at the mosques and you go to various places and you look at what's going on there. And it's very truly 100 percent. And certainly, you can say radical Islam is a disaster right now. It's causing tremendous problems worldwide, not just here. But the question was asked about Islam, and there is a great hatred. There is no question about it.
Good morning.
Morning.
Right. I know that at one point you did say that reading his bio, you called him pathological. I guess that was just part of the game?
Well, it was part of the game. I was -- all I was doing was trying to say exactly what he said, because he talked about his growing up, which was tough. And I just -- all I did was I read parts of what he said and then I hoped, so -- but it all worked out.
Right.
Doesn't look it's about 2 percent to me. So I make the statement. And look, we have a problem and they have a problem.
Right.
So I don't think we who's on our side. But I do respect the Kurds. They seem to be the ones that have most helped. But whether or not -- I mean, the question was asked of me, I want to be honest. I know it's -- it would be easier for me to say, well -- and I didn't say all. But boy, there's tremendous hatred there. No question about it. We might as well recognize it, folks.
Well, a lot of people say what's happening now is not working.
Well, what's what happening right now is not working. That's right. And at some point, we have to rebuild our country. We have to knock out ISIS. We have no choice but to knock out ISIS and to knock them out really, really big and rapidly.
Sure.
We have to get rid of them. You know they're chopping off heads. These are people -- this is medieval times, we're talking about. So, we have to stop being politically correct about the war. You know, we fight the war in a politically correct way. We don't bomb certain areas because we're worried about air pollution. I mean, it's hard to believe.
But absolutely accurate. Mr. Trump, we had heard that, apparently your strategy going in last night was to be essentially above the fray and not hit anybody unless they socked you. It seemed like, you know, I've have heard a number of analysts say you seemed very presidential last night. And yet, Rubio and Cruz did go after you. Rubio on Social Security and Cruz on trade. Did you accomplish what you wanted to, going in by the end of the two hours?
Yeah, I think so. By all scores, by everybody that scores the polls. And there are a lot of them. It's an amazing thing, by everyone -- you know, we have these polls coming out and they come out -- Drudge, as you know, who's such a fantastic person. But Drudge and Time magazine and all of them. And I won the debate by all scores, so maybe it shows I don't have to be so -- so, let's say, flamboyant.
Mr. Trump, can I ask you...
Last night was very important to me from the stand point of, if -- you know, assuming I wasn't attacked, I wasn't really hit the way I was previously. When you get hit, you have to fight back. I thought last night -- I thought it was a very civil debate, actually.
OK.
I'm going to go the other way. We're going to save Social Security, we'll make our country rich again and we're going to save Social Security and other things that we want for our people. It's time to stop cutting. Our people have gone through enough.
Donald, how do you put -- how do you calm these people at this point? You know, how do you say that the country is divided? I will give you that. But how do you unite it? I mean, these people, these people -- a lot of them show up to support you inside, a lot. But a lot showed up outside. Obviously not wanting to you speak.
Well, we had a lot of people inside, that's true. And I hated to say, don't do it but I don't want to see any of the people hurt. Either inside or outside. And law enforcement said, you know, they just don't have enough men to cover. You had 25,000 people tried to come. In fact, we were able to get in touch with thousands of people so they didn't come, so that we had, you know, like probably 10,000 people. We were able to ward off so they didn't come by saying, you know, we're not just going to hold the rally today. We're going to postpone it. Which I think turned out to be good. And I think it was a very good thing that we're able to do. I think what we did was intelligent after seeing it. I'm watching your show now. After seeing what's on the show. I just think it was a very good decision. I do not want to see people hurt.
There is an 80-year-old woman that we interviewed that Jeff Flock, a FOX Business Network interviewed in the last hour who said that she came out to protest because she said that you use hate speech. What do you say to that woman?
Well, I don't use hate speech. I don't use hate speech. I mean, we have a country and the country has to be, I'm just watching your show right now with that car. That's pretty serious stuff. With the car and the people standing in front of their car. There is tremendous, there is tremendous division in our country. I have seen it, I have been watching it, I'm witness to it. And something has to be done. When you look at the unemployment, among certain groups of people. It's incredible. It's just a tremendous division in the country.
Well, you know, Donald, it hasn't, I mean, as we are sort of struggling to figure out what's going on there and to think about it. I mean, this is not a demonstration against war or economic conditions. This is a protest as I understand it against your free speech. They are using free speech. They have a right to peaceful protest to try to shut you down from your free speech.
No. I think this is a demonstration against economic conditions on both sides. I think on one side they can't get jobs at all. You have 59 percent unemployment with the African-American youth. And on the other side they haven't been given a pay increase in 12 years because our businesses are leaving our country. So this is very economic. This has a lot to do with jobs. It has a lot to do with incompetent running of a country. A lot of this is the fact that they just -- I mean, you look at middle income people, the workers, the backbone of our nation, they haven't had a pay increase in 12 years. They are very angry people, Greta. And I will tell you they are not angry by nature but they are very angry people. And see, on the other side to a large extent, you have African-American youth has a 59 percent unemployment rate.
So, what happened --
So I think it's very economic.
I don't think there is any perfect answer on how to handle this tonight. I mean, there is no perfect answer. On the one hand, you know, canceling the rally, eliminate some of the risk of more trouble. On the other hand, it's also an indication of people who shut down your rally that if they follow you to the next city they might get that done which then stifles your voice. So, I mean, I'm not sure that there is a right answer --
See, they haven't shutdown the rally at all because it's on television now, Greta. And we are getting far more people watching it now than we would have if we had been in the arena. And people are seeing that we are being stifled, that free speech is being stifled. So, actually, they haven't shut down the rally. A big point has been made. And we will see what happens, but people should be able to rally in Chicago. I mean, we are talking about Chicago. They should be able to rally in Chicago. But I don't think anything has been shut down. First of all, it's been postponed and we'll do it again. But, you know, we had 25,000 people except. So we had 25,000 people coming. Some would have to be outside. And we were able to get many of those people not to show up based on the fact that we saw early on that there could be conflict. And if there is conflict we don't want to see people hurt.
Do you get scared at all, Donald, when you watch this stuff, worried about for yourself?
No, I don't get scared. I really don't get scared. I see it. It's part of life. It's happened. I have seen it over the years many times. It's tough stuff but it could have been a lot tougher if we decide to do go through. I think we made a very wise decision. It's all calmed down now they say. And I think we made a very wise decision to say that, you know, we are not going to do it tonight. We will do it another time. We have had very successful rallies, Greta. I have had 35, 40,000 people at rallies and we have never had a problem. This is the first time we have really had a problem.
If you are elected president, how do you convince those people who are outside tonight that you are their president?
Well, we have to get them jobs. We have to bring economics back. You look at what's going on with the economy. The economy is terrible. And everybody knows it. The five percent unemployment is a number that doesn't exist. That's probably 25 percent, maybe more than that. I think you look for a job and you give up looking for a job and you consider you statistically unemployed. And then they consider you employed. So, it's a mix-up like you have never seen before. That is a statistic that was meant for politicians to look good. And it bears no relationship to the real life or to the facts. I mean, we have a tremendous unemployment rate. And nobody understands that but when you look at a thing like this. You understand the economics of the country. For people living in our country have not been good. And again, middle income people haven't had a raise in 12 years effectively. And that's pretty sad.
If it's jobs and the economy it looks like the people outside are blaming you because they are protesting you.
Well, they have people protesting me. They also have many more people saluting me.
No, I know that. But I mean, I'm talking about --
And we turned away -- don't forget, Greta, we turned away 25,000 supporters and those people are on our side. So, now a lot of them have left or are leaving and, which would be a good thing, frankly, because I don't want to see conflict. And there is, you know, potential for conflict. Had I done it, I think we have been given a lot of praise for having done what we did. Had I done it, which would have been in a way easier, but I think you would have had a lot of problems tonight if I did.
Well, if we manage to get through the night with very few arrests. No violence, no one hurt, you know, we can, I mean, there is something to be said about the First Amendment although --
And then you will say, yes, then you will say I did a good job. But the First Amendment is affected because, you are not allow to do have free speech in a major city in the United States. That's not very good.
I was going to say that. I was going to say there's a First Amendment on the outside of the arena. But there is no -- there is no First Amendment inside the arena because you got shut down.
Yes. That's right. So, it's a little bit unfair to the people. You know, when you are turning away 25,000 people. That's pretty bad. I mean, you know, it's a pretty sad situation. Twenty five thousand great people coming to see a rally, enthusiastic about it and you are turning them away. That's pretty sad.
How are you going to do in Illinois on Tuesday?
I think we are going to do well, I mean, I don't know what effect this has. A lot of people say this is a positive in terms of votes. But I don't feel it one way or the other. People don't like to see what's happening. This is what is going on in our country, Greta. Look, we have a very divided nation. We have a tremendously divided nation. And I have been saying it for a long time. I have been saying it for years. Our nation is totally divided. In many ways it's divided. And, one of the ways it's divided is white, black. We have so many different sets of divisions and hopefully we will be able to bring it together. I'm a unifier. President Obama has not been a unifier. He has been a divider. I'm a unifier. I will bring people together. We have to start by getting them jobs. We can't lose our jobs, Greta, to every nation in the world. And we have kids that can't get a job and they have no hope of ever having a job.
Is there any other way to help be a unifier than jobs? Is there more to this?
Yes, there will be. You know, outreach programs and everything else. But still, jobs is always going to be number one. Getting people jobs will always be the best and the longest lasting way some.
You know, some people have written into me during the show and they are critical of the conditions in Chicago. And they say that it's conducive to this type of environment. There's been a lot of unrest in Chicago. A lot of gang violence and other things. There is this sort of a real general unhappiness in Chicago. Then I have people who write in and say that you are the divider.
Well, look, you know, you should be able to have a rally. And the rallies are very important. We should be able to have a rally in a major city in this country without having to -- without having to have such a big deal. I think this is -- in a way it's important. It shows what's going on in the United States. It shows a problem that we have in the United States. And we will going to have to overcome it and we will overcome it. But it all starts -- it's an economic problem. It all starts. People want to be able to get increases. They want to be able to work. They want to be able to have good jobs and at least they want to be able to have a job. We don't have that in this country.
The people -- the protesters outside, they didn't say they want jobs, in their chants they say, "Stop Trump."
Well, look, I mean, they are a much smaller number than just 25,000 people. But everybody has an opinion. I mean, they feel that way. You win an election, 55 to 45 and they consider it a landslide. So, you know, they certainly have their opinion. But my supporters have their opinion, too. And you see how strong they are.
What did the police say to you when you arrived? What did they say about what they anticipate in?
Well, they said we have a massive crowd of supporters that are going into the arena. At the same time we have a lot of protesters, a couple thousand protesters. And I just didn't -- I told them, I said I don't want to see them clash because if they clash a lot of bad things are going to happen, Greta.
You know what? I mean, the crowd are still there, Donald. They're not thinning it looks like. You know, I thought that they were. But we see pictures where they are shoving and pushing. It still looks pretty heated.
Well, I mean, I'm looking at your pictures, Greta. And you have been playing the same pictures for the last half hour, you know, it is actually getting thinner. You're playing the same pictures with the punching in the last half hour or so. Because I have seen it 10 times now watching your show. Listen, thank you, Greta. I really appreciate it.
You know what, Donald -- you know, what? I have seen this one before, too. I have got to tell you. You know, you are right on this picture. I have seen this video before --
No, no, they keep showing the same punches for, you know, I have seen now the one about 10 times already. So you understand. I don't blame you for doing that but you understand.
This may come as a big surprise to you. But, you know, I'm looking at this live as you are. You know, as it's happening. This is breaking news.
No, it's very much thinning out. I think we made a really good decision. But, you know, our First Amendment rights had been violated. We should be able to speak and it should be freedom of speech. And we shouldn't be stopped. But most importantly for tonight, it looks like it's breaking up very nicely and I think the police have done a good job. And everybody has done a good job.
Do you think you will get more votes after tonight or less after tonight in Illinois?
Everybody tells me I get more votes. We made a wise decision. And everybody tells me I get more votes. I don't know. I didn't do it for votes. I did it because I didn't want to see people hurt.
As you look at this, any regrets on running as you look at all this chaos?
No. We're going to make America great again, Greta. We're going to make America great again. That's what it's all about. That's the theme. And that's what I'm going to do. And that's very important. We will make America great again.
Well, Donald, I'm probably the only anchor as I have said before that's ever actually represented people in court on the First Amendment. I really, you know, I really like the First Amendment. As long as there is no violence.
Right. Well, that's what we have -- we have potential for violence. And I think we have stopped it and I think it's been quelled and I think we have made a very good decision tonight in terms of safety of people. So thank you very much, Greta.
Thank you, Donald.
Thank you very much. Bye.
We have Donald Trump on the line. Mr. Trump thank you for joining us. What's going on here?
Well, I came to the area and we just landed a little while ago and I guess they had 25,000 requested tickets from supporters and they were filling in and you had group of people on the other side and I felt and, you know, after meeting with law enforcement, we met with them for about a half an hour today, Chris. I felt that it was just safer. I don't want to see anybody get hurt and so far it seems to be working that way. But I felt it was much better to cancel rather than allow this up. We had thousands of people outside trying to get in, supporters, thousands of them, and far more than -- I think there are 10,000 seats. We had probably 25,000 people that we said, don't come, don't come. And we started working on it a little while ago, an hour ago, two hours ago telling people don't show up and we announced that for security reasons we were going to cancel it. We were going to postpone it and come back another time.
We're seeing a lot of pictures here --
I think, Chris, I think it was the right thing to do under the circumstances.
But we have television pictures now which are going to haunt this country for a while. There's pictures of you, I don't want to get in a racial stuff, you can watch the thing. It has an ethic factor. You see these people from different backgrounds getting in each other's faces and somebody throws a punch, give somebody the finger, you see a person here being held by the police. These people are so angry and they're angry over the issues you've raised, I mean, it's immigration, I guess. The people who are protesting your rally really don't like the people at the rally now. They've identified --
No, we have a very divided country, Chris.
Last thought, Mr. Trump, are you going to make any changes in your rhetoric? Because it looks like you can't have rally now in a big city anymore, because if you except a big diverse crowd and then don't vet people coming in, we're going to see a replay of this, it looks like. As you know, different people are watching this with different reactions. Some people say I'm not going to go to situation like that. And some people say I like that kind of a situation. I'll be going to that the next time. You know how people react to crowd situation.
Yes, you're right about that. No, I think we've had for the most part, we've had, by far, the biggest rallies. I mean, literally, we had over 25,000 people wanting to come today. And it's incredible when you look at it. I've had many -- I've had the biggest rallies by far, bigger than anybody. Far bigger than Bernie or anybody. And, you know, frankly, we've had very, very little disruption. We've had protests where an individual would stand up and, you know, would be whisked out. Not a big deal. But we have had very, very little protest. And we've had nobody hurt. And, hopefully, we can keep that going. That's why I did this today. I don't want to see people hurt or worse. And I think -- I think we made the right move in doing that, Chris, rather going through to it --
I agree. But let me --
-- and forcing a very bad situation.
We're watching a recurring tape here of an African-American guy. I'd say he's in his 30s, maybe, not much older, young guy.
Right, I think he is.
He's a very middle class, I can tell -- he's well-dressed. My sense is he's really angry at your rally. What do you say to him if you had chance to chat with that guy about what you're trying to do for this country as potential president? What do you say to him?
Well, I want to bring back jobs, Chris. I mean, you talk about African-American youth, 58 percent, 59 percent unemployment rate. You have to bring back jobs. I'd be angry too. And I'm looking at him, and he looks like he's an intelligent guy but there's a lot of anger. And, you know, frankly, we have to bring jobs back to this country. Our jobs are going to Mexico. Our jobs are going all over the world. They are going everywhere but here. You see Nabisco moving out.
Mr. Trump, why did you say go get a job when you're saying you're going to bring jobs? You recognize these kids, young people sometimes of all groups don't have jobs. Why did you mock the guy and say go get a job?
Because, frankly, he was very nasty guy. He was somebody that was giving us -- he was very, very loud. Very boisterous and he was swinging his fists. And he just looked to me like somebody that, frankly, maybe he did have a job. Maybe he didn't. I don't really know. But it was something I said. Nothing wrong with saying it. Go get a job. But the fact is, it's not easy to get jobs, Chris. It's not easy to get jobs in this country.
There's a guy waving a sign, I think he might be Hispanic, I can't tell, but he's waving a sign that suggests he is. He says, "Liberation not deportation." What's your reaction to that message from a protester?
Well, I have no reaction to it. We have to have people come in and it's got to be done through a process. It's got to be legal and we don't have a country. But they have to come in and they have to come in legally, Chris. Very simple. We have to have borders. If we don't have borders, we don't have a country.
So, the only is -- when you set up rally in Chicago, which is a city which is majority Hispanic and African-American now, I believe the statistics are, that you went into a situation where you knew there would be a lot of people on a Saturday that would have the time and the passion to come out like this fellow we're watching here on tape to come back and protest your situation. So, there was really no surprise here, was there, in what happened? Given the venue of your event tonight?
Chris, it shouldn't matter, it shouldn't matter. You know, you're the first one to say it. It shouldn't matter whether it was, you know, whoever lives in the city. I mean, it shouldn't make a difference. Whether it's White, Black, Hispanic, it shouldn't matter. I mean, if you have a rally, you have a rally.
But they don't like what you're saying. They don't like what you're saying.
Well, we shouldn't be restricted from having rally here because of ethnic makeup or anything like that. I'm somebody that feels strongly that it shouldn't make any difference. And you usually feel that too. That's why I'm surprised you're bringing this up because it shouldn't matter.
No, I just believe that you could have predicted this. That's all I'm saying. You could have predicted this.
Chris, Chris, we shouldn't be able to predict it. It shouldn't -- we really shouldn't be able to predict it. We should be able to -- it's major city in the United States. It's great city, Chicago. It's, you know, a place that I have investments, big investments. And it's great city. And, you know, it shouldn't matter that we're having rally in Chicago or that we're having a rally someplace else. And you know, I watched your show and you're the first one to say that. So, I'm surprised you're saying this, to be honest with you. But, you know, I think we did the right thing. A lot of people are saying we did the right thing. In fact, we're being given credit for it. And I just -- I think it's breaking up now. It will be -- looks like it's going to be just fine.
Do you think that you were -- the protesters have been expected tonight at your rally. Was your campaign prepared for this?
Oh, I think we were prepared. But, you know, you can be prepared as you want when you have thousands of people, you don't want to see attack...
Yeah.
... and they were minors comers is but no major clash. So we...
Do you think that's what caused that directly tonight the scuffle?
Say it again?
Do you think that caused the scuffle directly tonight because those people who were fighting weren't fighting over job?
Yeah. I think it is largely economic. I mean if you look at African-American youth, they have a 59 percent unemployment rate, 59 percent. And its, yeah, I think its largely economic problem. Absolutely.
Let me just read something.
There's great love, Don let me just finish by saying. There is great love in those big stadiums and there is great love there.
But there are protests that...
At the same time when there's a clash, who are potential clash like tonight, I think did I the right thing. I'm here, I meet I came here and met with law enforcement. And I said what do you think? And they're very professional and they said, it would be better not to do it, because if you do it tonight, you could have a clash and people could get hurt. I don't want to see people get hurt.
Our reporters who follow you, Mr. Trump and who have been very fair with you have said that they have not seen protesters attacking anyone. If anything it is the other way around that protesters are being attacked after they start to protest or to anyway disagree with you. But they're not -- protesters are not the ones who resort to violence first. It is...
It's totally, you know it is not true when you say that statement Don. You know it's not true.
What we're doing is showing an example of the violence that happened. Just as, when you're on a campaign trail, you use examples of the worst of things in order to make a point. And so now we're looking why...
But you don't have anything saying that it's not live. And frankly, its Donald Trump speaks live with Don.
OK. So this -- what you're looking at right now is live.
You're showing the scene that took place two hours ago Don and that's not good reporting, it's not fair.
What you're looking at right now is live, Mr. Trump. This is live. These are the streets of the Chicago outside.
Right now, it's live, yeah, but if you look that, that's a very small portion of the people. Most of them have been dispersed.
Are you going to postpone every rally because of the threat of protesters?
What would you like me to have them Don and you would like to see people killed?
I'm just asking you the question. Are you going to do it?
I don't know. It depends on case by case. But I mean, if would you like me to have them and people would have been hurt badly tonight, I mean again, I'm looking at scenes that you know, just a little while...
This is live. Mr. Trump you're looking at these are live scenes.
No. No. I'm talking about I've been watching all these scenes...
OK.
... so many times ago and they're two hours old.
Mr. Trump I have to ask you just for clarification.
Most of the people have been dispersed and we've been given great credit. And law enforcement gave us great credit for making the right decision.
Do you think it would help, Mr. Trump if you met with some of these protesters and try to understand what they will say?
Well, I wouldn't mine meeting them if the meeting was in good faith. But, you know, a lot of them don't, they just have fun of it. They make this a career, I mean this is a career. Protesting is a business for them.
Yeah.
But I certainly don't condone violence and it's not acceptable to me.
Yeah, well, Mr. Trump, thank you so much for coming on. You know, you're always welcome here to say your piece on the show and we'll always treat you fairly. Thank you sir.
Thank you very much Don, thank you.
Yes.
... really stifled the 1st Amendment rights. And you know, it's interesting. If we ever did that to them, it would be a national disgrace, a national story and the likes of which you've never seen. But when they do it to us, it's a very big deal. So we have, you know, these incredible people that, unfortunately, were shut out from hearing what they wanted to hear.
The commentary is so over the top...
I know.
About 30 people, right? Yes.
Yes, they were very, very...
Yes.
... to get in, and now they end up going home empty-handed. I don't like it.
Now, did law enforcement recommend this to you, as well? You have Secret Service protection.
Yes, they did. They recommended it. They did strongly recommend it.
Yes.
And I understood it. I understood exactly what they said. They're very professional. The law enforcement I think did great job because, you know, you could see it. Had this gone forward, that was a staged deal by Moveon or whoever might be doing it, but that was a staged deal. Had this gone forward, there would have been tremendous clashes and a lot of people would have been hurt. So -- and now I see the streets are empty. I know I'm watching your show, but -- and it looks like you have a picture from much earlier.
We do. We have a picture from earlier.
Right. The streets are now empty.
Yes.
And this is -- believe it, this is an Obama situation, too. He has caused tremendous division in this country. He's a -- I call him the great divider. And we're going to unify the country. It's going to be tough but we're going to unify the country. But right now, we have a very, very divided country.
Yes.
I'm very happy in the decision we made tonight. And there's been very, very little damage done, and most importantly, there's essentially been nobody even hurt. And I think if we would have made the wrong decision tonight, could have been something that would have been very bad. And everybody's very happy...
You know...
... with what we did and how it's come out.
By the way, for the record, you were going to be on camera with us tonight, but at the advice of caucuses and others they asked you not to. Is that correct?
Well, I think they probably felt that it would be better not to. But, you know, look, I think we can communicate just as well this way. Otherwise I would have done it.
All right, Mr. Trump. Thank you for your time tonight.
OK, thank you very much, Sean.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Well...
... I canceled and postponed the other day in Chicago...
Yes.
... because, frankly, if I went up, we would have had my -- my supporters have tremendous love of this country.
So...
... on your program by John King all morning long.
Mister...
It had to be 10,000 or 15,000 people.
I would just ask...
Our country is in trouble.
Thank you, Mr. Trump.
Thank you.
Mr. Trump --
And we have to eradicate these people.
You know as well as I do, I didn't ask the question. And --
I'm not talking about you, I'm talking about Fox.
OK.
I gave you the report card. I gave you the A during the debate because they said it was a D. And it was an A. And I gave you the A from Better Business Bureau --
But don't you think you have the responsibility to check it out, to find out what's going on? And the fact is, it's a little more complicated than that, because Trump University has been out of business for several years. They're not getting so many complaints --
It's not out of business. It's not out of business. It's suspended until after I win the lawsuit.
I think it's just wanting to check the facts. But in any case, let me -- you'll like there last question, so bear with me on this.
All right.
Because for all of the controversy --
I'll love it --
I promise you, you will. Here, you can tell me afterwards when you like this question.
All right.
Mr. Trump, thank you. Thanks for your time. And I hope you and all the people attending your rallies stay safe on the campaign trail, sir.
Thank you very much.
Donald Trump, welcome.
Thank you.
After you won Michigan and Mississippi, you said, "I can be more presidential than anyone, except Abe Lincoln," but you're constantly under attack. That is true. I hear people say, "can't he tone down the insults a little bit and start acting a little more president?"
The problem is I started off how it was 17, way up 17 people. It's a little smart, a little tough, you know, governors, senators...
You've got three opponents.
...now I'm down to three, all right. And I was being attacked from every angle imaginable. I mean, it was really amazing and I had to be tough and I had to be sharp and I had to be nasty in some cases because they were nasty. And now, we're down to a few, and you know, I want to finish the game. And look, I went to the best school, I was a good student. I'm a very smart person...
Right.
...I can be the most politically correct person that you have ever interviewed and I do joke. I can be the best other than Abe, honest Abe with a hat, he'd be tough. He's the ultimate, right? But I would say this, I can be very presidential. But it just hasn't been -- this is a highly competitive thing with all these people...
...but you said, he got talent. You were...
...I said sure he's got talent, he's got talent but he hurt himself badly...
But you're calling him corrupt, are you now thinking, OK, I may need to mend fences with this guy if I'm going to -- I win this thing?
I don't want to really discuss it. Honestly...
Yes.
The reason I don't is because we'll see what happens. But I will say this -- he was better off before he attacked. And I don't do the attacking. I mean I'm a counterpuncher. I don't do the attacking if you look at every one of the 17...
But you always say they started it.
They started it, and then they go packing. And there's something awfully nice about that. Wouldn't it be nice to have that working for our country?
In the Detroit debate when you talked about the size of your hands and the size of something else...
I didn't talk about it. Marco talked about it.
Well, I was going to say, he started it, you were responding...
Sure.
...it was a joke. I didn't have any great problem with it. But it led to a tsunami of coverage including this front-page headline in "The New York Times," the descent in the Donald Trump's pants, how does that help you?
Look, he made a statement that I had small hands. He made it up. He's a politician. Politicians lie. I don't have small hands. I have good hands. Look, my hands are good...
What the record show.
OK?
Right.
I have good hands...
Did Melania think that was a good place for you to go?
She didn't like my mentioning it, but I did. Look, I was shaking hands two days later and people were saying, oh, you have large hands. You look wonderful and they were shocked. The world thought, why should I -- why shouldn't I say it? He lied. And I called him out. Now, should I have done it? Yes, I should have done it. Because now at least they know it was a lie. Look, he became very nasty, Marco and I became therefore probably nastier and it turned out to be a very bad thing for him. But I do believe when you get hit, you got to hit back.
Let's talk about flexibility. That's came up because word leaked of an off-the-record meeting you had with "The New York Times" editorial board about immigration...
OK.
...and you say that was off the record and I take off the record very seriously...
...very important.
So, I don't want to ask you about that.
Sure.
I want to ask you about the larger issue which some of your opponents think that when you make these sweeping declarations and then you talk about flexibility maybe you are not good to carry out all the things you say you would do.
Flexibility is very important. You can't say this is the way it is and...
To be stuck in cement.
...I will not talk to you. I will not -- and you know, I use the example, so the wall is going to be 40 feet, so it's going to be 38 feet.
Negotiating.
...but -- it's called negotiating.
You said you're a common sense conservative?
Yes.
When do you position that some on the right don't like is that you say don't touch social security and Medicare people paid into it, they're entitled to get the benefits. But those are, as you know, two monster entitlement programs...
Sure.
...that are, along with Medicaid, driving the federal that 45% of the budget when you include Medicaid, do you say, I wouldn't even look at raising the retirement age, no changes what so ever...
I don't want to change -- I tell you what, I don't want to change. And, by the way, the Democrats aren't going to change. I watched them the other night they're talking about increasing it...
Right.
...and I'm saying...
...more of the democratic position...
...oh, good -- no, no...
Why should billionaire...
You know then you wonder...
Why should you and your billionaire friends be...
Oh, I would like to do a system where people voluntarily -- I would give it up in two seconds and so would a lot of people that I know. And somebody said they don't want to do that I would give it up in two seconds, make it a voluntary basis. I would say this...
Speaking of your detractors on the ride, national reviews did come out very forcibly against you, at your press conference the other night you said, these are idiots who don't have any common sense...
I didn't use the word idiot. No, I didn't use the word idiot.
I thought I heard you use the word...
Whatever.
...but...
...but, you know, you could use that word, it could be acceptable.
...why are they with these people who are fighting for their vision of conservative principles in which in many cases doesn't...
Because, they shouldn't be attacking me. Look, we have something that's very unique. Millions of people are going to the polls right now, and they're going -- and they're voting for Donald Trump, millions and millions -- more than has ever happened for the Republican Party...
Yes.
...regardless, but more than have ever gone to the polls. The Democrats are down 30% -- 35%...
Right.
...the Republicans are up...
We're at Mar-a-Largo.
OK, but they call them -- or they call them the establishment, OK? So, let's say the establishment -- the establishment should embrace what we're doing.
I know you once gave money to Hillary Clinton and then you invited her to your wedding because you were New York businessman and it was your job to get along with politics...
Yes...
...especially you're in Democratic now...
Absolutely.
In 2012, as the four-year Secretary of State, you told Fox she was a terrific woman...
Yes.
...did a very good job at the state department, so was that BS?
I'm a businessman. So, why should I say...
So, was that BS?
I don't say BS, I don't say anything. I say, why would I say bad? I have to go to the state department to get approval on some project that I'm building in some foreign country and they have to give me a letter of recommendation. Why would I say that?
If you do well in this Tuesday's Primary's, and you have a bigger lead than you have now and there will have a point have been 12 debates, will you be to the point where you say we don't need any more debates?
Oh, I think the debates are out of control I think it's ridiculous and I think the debates are absolutely -- I think how many times can you ask the same question and it's ridiculous.
So, are you prepared...
Oh, I mean they're very good. They get great ratings.
Right.
Why do they get great ratings?
From your point of view, do you know why...
Do you know why they get great ratings? Do you think it's because of Marco Rubio?
I think I know what you're saying.
...or is it because of Senator Cruz, I don't think so? But look, they're making a fortune. The networks Fox and CNN and all of them, they're making an absolute fortune. You know, these debates used to be throwaways, you know that. They used to be television...
...people watched, nothing like now.
...they used to be television dead land they called it. They were forced to...
So, are you considering -- but you mention in the debate in terms of your participation...
I'll do what I have to do I mean...
OK.
...but I just -- I will tell you, I think we've had enough debates. I like the debates. I've actually enjoyed the debates and think I've been good at it because I've won every poll about the debates. But yes, I think we've had enough debates.
You've talked about being unhappy with "The New York Times" and "Washington Post" reporting on you, you say we should open the libel laws to make it easier...
Absolutely.
Right.
OK. Look, I can sue, but I can't -- you can't win...
Let me read it one of your many tweets about the media. This one said, I am watching two clown announcers on Fox News as they try to build up failed presidential candidate little Marco. Fox news is in the back. My first question is, is there any possibility that you watched too much cable news and get...
No, I think Fox is very prone toward Marco Rubio.
...you still have a lot of times reacting to the pundits...
Yes, yes because I think it's false stuff. I think Krauthammer has just absolutely a disgrace when it comes to me. Don't forget he was a big war hawk, going to Iraq -- going to Iraq. I mean he was wrong on so many subjects. I think he is. Steven Hayes treats me terribly. It wouldn't matter what I do, Steven Hayes -- I don't know Steven Hayes.
OK. I wrote a column the other day about the way in which some of the columnists and commentators are really ranching up the language against you. And I want to read this and very harsh stuff...
OK.
Donald Trump thanks very much for sitting down with us in Palm Beach.
Thank you very much.
But...
And, you know, I mean, give me a break. And you tell me about how good he's doing. He's doing terrible job for Ohio.
But when you say --
So instead of getting --
Yes.
-- you got to stop them. Do whatever you want to do. I have no objection to what I said. I would say it again. People are there, doing harm, you have to go and you have to use equal force.
Do you plan --
It's not fair. It's a one-way street.
So it's possible -- it's possible you could help him with legal fees if this man needs it?
I've actually instructed my people to look into it, yes.
Turned out to be a hoax.
-- an American flag --
Well, that, I don't --
-- ground and just dragging it along?
I'm talking about the ISIS tweet.
Well, you didn't see the clip.
So you will not --
And that's what they're --
I will leave it there. Mr. Trump, stay safe on the trail. And we'll watch you Tuesday. Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
I love you Donald Trump," he said. "You're the future of America. I've been waiting 17 hours. I got here at 11 o'clock last night. I was the first one here. I just wanted to know... I would love to a get a picture with you before I leave today.
I'll do that. I'll do that. Thank you.
I come here because you made a comment to John McCain that you don't think captured soldiers are heroes
Oh, no no no. I was -- I never did that. You know that.
What I want you to do is just clarify that for me because I think it's important for all these people here and for a lot of veterans that's here in Ohio, especially here in Ohio, I know what you were doing
You know exactly what I was doing
I wanted you to explain that
But they are heroes, just so you understand, and real heroes, OK? You know that. Thank you... thank you. You know that. Thank you. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. OK, who else?
Mr. Trump, I have four sons in the army and my one son is a nurse psychiatric practitioner dealing with the PTSD. He tells me every day that my son... is overwhelmed dealing with this. What are your plans to help him out?
That is such a big problem and I hear it from so many different people and also, I mean, the big problem is with the V.A. It's horribly run. It's a corrupt enterprise. It's really corrupt and you look at what's going on in Phoenix with the V.A., it's a disaster. A complete disaster. We're going to take care of the problem. They are having a tremendous problem with that. I fully know it. I fully understand it. We're going to do something about it. We have no choice. We have to do something about it. The truth is we have to treat our veterans much, much better. Our veterans are not being treated well. Thank you, man. Thank you.
No, I was just wondering that even though (Husted) is a Republican, do you still support him on that?
Do I support...?
Jon Husted's decision?
Well, I'll have to look at the decision, darling. Honestly, I'll have to look at it. You tell me what to do. You're with me, you're working with us, you're a volunteer. What do you want me to do? If I could vote -- I actually missed the deadline by four months -- I would definitely vote for you. Awe, we love you. Thank you, honey. Thank you.
I'm from Ohio. My name is Misty. My entire family is from Kentucky. They were very happy to vote for you in the Kentucky Primary. It is so refreshing to have a presidential candidate that is not bought and paid for and I 100 percent believe in you that you will make America great again.
Awe, thank you so much. That's better than a question. I love it.
Hi, I'm Zack. I'm from Kentucky. I have one question. On what day in office will you put Hillary in prison?
So you know, there's a six-year statute of limitations, I guess, and Hillary's fighting for a lot... Look, let's face it -- look, it's not complicated. What she did certainly to me, is certainly she broke the law, to me. What do I know? To me, she broke the law. It looks so bad from the standpoint of the rest of the country and even the standpoint of all those people that did much less. So many people did much less. How do you think they feel? But you know what? The first thing I have to do with Hillary is beat her. The next thing we'll do is look into that.
If you win, do you think he'll be able to retire?
We're going to make this country so strong. We're not going to stand for losing $500 billion a year with China, for losing $58 million with Mexico, for losing hundreds with Japan. We're going to make our country strong again. You know, our military, OK, everyone sees our military budget, they don't realize we take care of Germany. Nobody probably even knows that. We take care of Japan. Do you know if we're attacked -- we have a treaty with Japan -- if we're attacked Japan doesn't have to help us. If Japan gets attacked, we're in the third World War. We have a new war going on, OK? Now what kind of deals are these? What kind of deals? We take care of Japan. We take care of South Korea. I love all these countries. I think it's great, except we owe $19 trillion. We can't do it. We've got to be reasonable. We can't do it. So we're taking care of South Korea when the maniac next door acts up, we start up those battleships, we start up those aircraft carriers, let's say, and we start up, you know, our planes are flying over. We spend millions and millions of dollars. They don't pay us. They pay us very little.
My name is Roger. I'm here in Cincinnati. I'm also the CEO of the Motorcycle Rifle Association. We've endorsed your campaign.
We are going to protect the second amendment, Roger.
That's your membership card.
You know the motorcycle guys love Trump? Did you know that?
My name is Katrina, and I am a Native American. My native name is 'woman who sees.' Do you know all the other ethnic groups we've supposedly done things to have been apologized to but at no point the Native Americans have been apologized to? After you take the oath, maybe in the first month or so you can say, 'I'm sorry as I can be that we did what we did to you.'"
Well, I'll certainly look into it. I haven't been big on apologizing, you do know that right? They complain Trump never apologizes. I'll look into it. We're going to do one more. We want a good one. Give me a fun one. Give me a fun question, alright?... I don't want to leave with a bad question.
What could you do, what do you see yourself doing in your plans to improve and bring leadership and bring dedication and integrity back to Washington, D.C.?
Let me just tell you, it's sort of the kind of question that's very important but not exactly the most exciting question. But you know what it is? You know what it is? Look, you have an ability to lead. You either can lead or you can't. And you can learn something about leadership, but basically you're a leader or not a leader. I'll get people together. We're going to make great deals. We're going to make conservative deals. We're going to make wonderful deals. We're going to get along with people. We're going to get along with Democrats. We're going to get along with liberals. We're going to make deals.
Yes.
You have to vote.
Absolutely. And -- and you've talked a lot at recent rallies about how you want to unify the country.
Right.
Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, thanks very much for joining us. I want to get right to the issue of security. We've noticed a very visible security presence at your events over the weekend, surrounded by Secret Service officers and agents. Are you worried about your personal safety?
No, I'm really not, Wolf. If you look at what's been going on, we have had not only tremendous security, but we have tremendous love in the rooms where we are. We have thousands and thousands of people. I have massive crowds, by far the biggest. And we'll have 25,000 people, and we'll go through sessions where we have absolutely no protesting -- or when you say protesting, disruption or protesting, we have absolutely none. Very rarely do we have a problem.
I'm sure when your family -- your wife, your kids -- see all those Secret Service officers standing around you, as they did this weekend, they're probably worried about your safety, aren't they?
Well, I think the Secret Service -- first of all, they do a fantastic job. But I think generally speaking, you know, it was the idea for Secret Service because of the crowds I get, because I do -- we do have very big crowds. And, frankly, I don't think anybody thinks of it that way. But the Secret Service is evident. They're there are quite a few people because the crowds are so big, Wolf. That's the only reason.
Yes, but this seems like a new development based on that protester trying to jump through a line on Friday night that we all saw. That was obviously very disturbing.
Well, I haven't noticed -- I haven't noticed that much of a difference. We've always had the Secret Service around. And, you know, I feel very secure.
Your reaction to Secretary Clinton?
Well, she has to say what she has to say, Wolf. I mean, she has very uninspired crowds. Her crowds are very small. Her -- you know, if you look at the poll numbers, they're down 35 percent because people -- from four years ago -- because people are not inspired by her or by Bernie. There is nothing much to be inspired. It's boring and not very inspiring. So she only wished she had my crowds and she only wished she had the enthusiasm that I have in my crowds. There is no enthusiasm for Hillary or her crowds.
Donald Trump, thanks very much for joining us.
OK. Thank you very much, Wolf. Thank you.
So, Donald, today, Governor Palin was campaigning with you. Do you know anything about the condition of her husband, Todd? He was in a snow machine accident.
He was, a pretty serious accident. And it was -- really, she was very concerned. And he has some badly broken bones and ribs. And he's a tough cookie, you know that. He will be OK, but he was pretty badly hurt.
And any idea of how long he is going to be in the hospital? I mean, we heard intensive care, which of course, always is so alarming when you hear that.
Right. Well, you know Todd. You know that whatever it will be, he will do it for less. I mean, he's a tough guy and a great guy. And he will be fine. But he had a very bad accident.
So, big day tomorrow.
It is.
Now there's another debate coming up. I know you've been blowing hot and cold on whether you're attending on prior debates. Do you expect to be attending the next G.O.P. debate?
Well, I know nothing about another debate. Nobody told me. I was told that the last one was our last debate. So I actually know nothing about it. Somebody told me they would like to do more debates. And, you know, the networks like that because they are making a fortune. They are getting great ratings if I'm in them. In fact, they are getting great ratings.
Donald, thank you very much for joining us. As I say to every candidate, good luck. And we will be following it tomorrow, sir.
Thank you very much, Greta.
Donald Trump joins us by phone now. Mister Trump, good morning to you.
Good morning.
Remember our dear friend, Tim Russert? He used to have a saying about elections. He'd hold up that dry-erase board and it said, Ohio, Ohio, Ohio. If you win Florida tonight and you win Ohio, you could be on your way to the nomination but you're going up against the sitting governor there, John Kasich. He has never lost a statewide election. Could he ruin your night?
Well, he's 22-0 in terms of losing. He has lost every single state that he's been in. And I'll tell you what. I've -- in terms of the presidential, he's done very, very poorly and I've spent a lot of time in Ohio. I was there last night in Youngstown. And I want to tell you, he is not such a popular guy. He approved NAFTA. He's now trying to approve -- approve TPP, which is a total disaster. NAFTA destroyed Ohio, took the businesses out of Ohio and he voted for it. You look at what he's done. He's in favor of common core. He's just now come out in favor of amnesty and open borders. I think the man is just not very popular. I really don't. I mean, look, he has not won one race in terms of presidential. He's -- I guess he's 0 for 22. And, Matt, I -- I really don't see it happening. I've -- I've been with the people of Ohio. They hate the fact that their coal industry and steel industry is gone. And I think we're going to do very well in Ohio.
Mister Trump, if you are able to win in Ohio, win in Florida, have a big night tonight, and it looks like you are on track to get those twelve hundred and thirty-seven delegates, do you expect Republican leaders, the Republican Party, to then fall in line behind you as the presumptive nominee?
I do. I mean, they're already calling. I have the biggest people in the party, if there is such a thing, because I'm not sure exactly whether to use the word establishment, what it means. Mitt Romney ran, by the way, the worst race perhaps in the history of presidential politics.
Who is calling?
And now he's campaigning -- he's out now campaigning for Kasich. And I think people are extremely -- you know, I think people are not digging Mitt Romney too much. That's for sure. They're going to send him the signal. But the biggest people in the party are calling. They want to sit down. They want to make the -- you know, Paul Ryan is an example. I have a lot of respect for him. He called last week. A lot of people are calling because they see what's happening. Look, Savannah, we brought millions of people, millions. And it's the biggest story in politics worldwide. We brought millions of people in and they're voting in the primaries. We're up seventy percent. The Democrats are down thirty-five percent. There's no enthusiasm for Hillary, especially. I mean, there's just no enthusiasm.
Let me jump in here.
So we brought millions of people and those people are going to give us a tremendous victory in November.
Let me ask you to comment, Mister Trump, about this new ad that's running in many states. It's from a PAC called Our Principle and it's an anti-Trump PAC. And basically, it takes real women and they repeat some of the things you had said about women over the course of the last several months or -- or year or so. It's very difficult to watch. Would you like to take back any of these comments you've made?
Let me just say about that. That was an ad put up by Mitt Romney's people. Mitt Romney is a sour guy.
Well, it's an anti-Trump PAC. No question.
No, no. I'm just telling you. No, no, no. Let me just tell you. Every single poll of every single state that I've won, of which I've won, you know, a vast majority, but every single poll coming out, the exit polls, I lead with women. I lead with the military. I lead with the vets. I lead with virtually everybody.
But to Matt's question, would you take back any of these quotes, any of these things you've said that you think in the light of day, well, maybe -- maybe that wasn't the greatest thing to say?
Honestly, I have not seen the ad, so I would have to see it. I've heard about the ad but I have not seen the ad.
All right. Donald Trump, obviously a huge day for you and the other candidates on both sides of the spectrum. We thank you for your time this morning.
Thank you very much.
So, you're not going to?
No, I didn't -- I didn't say that. I haven't looked at it yet, and nobody has asked me to pay for fees. And somebody asked me that question, and I haven't even seen it. So, I'd never said I was going to pay for fees...
No, but you said you were looking into it. But I'm just saying, if you're open to that, wouldn't -- by paying those fees, wouldn't that be rewarding violence?
Well, maybe so, and maybe that's why I wouldn't do it. I don't condone violence at all, and you know, I looked and I watched and I'm going to make a decision, but I certainly don't condone violence, and maybe you're right and maybe that's why I wouldn't do it.
Mr. Trump, thanks for joining us this morning.
Thank you very much.
Well, you have said...
People are not happy.
You don't think you still have to take Cruz out? If -- if your -- if you take Ohio and Florida, you don't still think Ted Cruz will be there?
I don't think so. Look, I won all of the southern states. He was supposed to win every one of them. I won every one of them. I've won with the evangelicals. You look at South Carolina, he was supposed to win South Carolina. That was his big watershed. I won in a landslide. I won with the military and the vets, won with women. I won with every single category. So I don't see it, and now, we're heading into New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania. I mean, those states I'm going to win.
Listen, before you go, yesterday around noon, we got the news flash that Sarah Palin's husband Todd was seriously injured in a snow machine incident up in Alaska. How is he doing today? Because I know there was some suggestion she was going to leave the campaign events. How is he today?
He -- he's doing really well. He's got broken ribs and he's got some -- you know, broken bones actually. He's a tough cookie. If you know Todd, he's a great guy and he is so incredible and she was really devastated and worried, and yet, she got up and made a wonderful speech in front of a lot of people. And then I said, "Sarah, don't listen to my speech, go home, " and she went home. And she's -- she's fantastic. You know, Todd is a tough cookie. So he's going to be fine. But he broke some bones and broke some ribs.
All right. Thank you so much, Donald.
OK. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Thank you.
The Republican frontrunner and the big winner from last night on the phone now. Mr. Trump, do you have us?
Yes, I do.
Congratulations on a big night. We were just talking about what this means going forward. Ted Cruz is telling people, look, John Kasich has to get out. I'm the only one who beats Trump and I do it again and again, especially when it gets to closed primaries, meaning just Republicans, I can beat him. What do you say?
Well, you know, it's amazing. I hear Ted saying that all the time. I beat him five times, or something. But I beat him 14 or 15 times. He doesn't say that. He leaves off the second part, Chris. He always leaves it off. I beat Donald Trump five times, I'm the only one. But I beat him 15 times and I guess yesterday or last night I beat him 5 times, including the islands. We picked up nine for the Northern Mariana Islands, and that was a great one, that was yesterday too. So we were five and one yesterday. Missouri was called last night and we were five and one.
We're not calling Missouri yet because it's too close, but there's no question that you did well. You're starting to talk about unifying the party, and I want to go through that with you, but the first question on that level is, what do you say to Ted Cruz this morning? If your goal is to unify the party, that means he has to get out. What do you think you could say to Ted Cruz to make him go along with your plan?
Well, I don't think he has to get out. I think he has to stay in and I think he has to run and John has to run and we'll see what happens. I think I have a good chance of getting there before the convention. With what we won yesterday, if you look at it, that was just about as good as if I won Ohio, and I did well in Ohio, but I was running against a popular governor and it's not easy because they have the machine working and I didn't have time, I ran out of a little time. I think if I had a day or two more it would have been perhaps a little bit different but I congratulate John on that. I think he deserved it. And frankly, to be honest with you, I think we're doing very well. You know, with the bonuses that you get and with Illinois being a tremendous win, that was a very, very big win. That was far greater than we even thought. We get a lot of different bonuses which I didn't even know about and I think that it was just about the equivalent as if I had a normal set of victories plus Ohio. It was pretty much, we got about the number of delegates that we would have gotten the other way.
So the delegate count is going the right way for you. Obviously, it's a race to see if you can get to 1,237, and then if you can survive the convention. Those are if's, now. One of the things that we can talk about with more certainty is how you get from here to there. You talked about being a unifier. Does that mean you're considering change the divisive rhetoric, toning down some of the hostility that you bring to crowds in the interest of unifying your part?
Well, you know, the crowds that we have, Chris, have been very, very -- I mean, my audiences and crowds have been fantastic, but we have agitators come into some of the rooms -- I've had, even over the last few days, I've had fantastic numbers, 12,000, 20,000 people where there's been nobody that even stood up. But sometimes we'll have somebody stand up and start screaming and then the press fix it up like it's a big deal, but to be honest with you, we have had tremendous harmony and there's love in those rooms. These are not even rooms, they're stadiums. We have 15,000, 20,000 people. You see it yourself on a regular basis. And I think really the biggest story, from the standpoint of politics, maybe in the world today, is how many people are coming into the Republican polls, meaning voting in the primaries, because it's up 100 percent, it's up 70 percent in some states, I mean we have lines that go for blocks long when they used to have two people standing in a room, and it's actually the biggest story worldwide in politics, what's happening and I would tell you that those people are there for me, they're not there for other people.
Your response --
Well I think she's an embarrassment to our country. She's under federal investigation. She doesn't have the strength or the stamina to be president, frankly, as far as I'm concerned. She doesn't have strength, she doesn't have the stamina, I think she would -- she talks about defeat our enemies. Well where has she been for the last year? We can't even beat ISIS. She's not defeating our enemies. She wouldn't know how to defeat the enemy. It's ridiculous. So I think she's an embarrassment and we'll see what happens. Look, I'm going to run a race, I'm sure it'll be tough, and she's going to run a race and she'll be tough, but I will tell you, I think in the end, all of these people that are coming out to vote, they're tired of a country that can't even beat -- we can't beat ISIS, we can't beat anybody on trade. She talks about beating adversaries, that, to me, is -- the worst of her statements is that we, when you're talking about adversaries, because we are losing to every single group of people within countries that we're opposed -- look at trade. Look what China's doing to us. Look what Japan is doing to us. Look what everybody is doing to us. Look at the war. Look at what ISIS is doing to us. Look at what everybody else is doing to us. They laugh at us. They take our equipment, they take our military stuff, and what do they do with it? They turn it and they aim it at us because we don't know what we're doing, so certainly, I will be the one that does defeat the adversary. She can't, she doesn't know how to.
The attacks on her, we get it, that those are going to be coming, that's part of the game, no question about it, but we all know the problems. It becomes, what are the solutions? You hear from people in your own party and across lines that they have concerns about what you say and what it brings out in American people. Do you have concerns about whether or not what got you to where you are can take you all the way? Are you considering changing any of the divisiveness that comes out of you?
Well, I think as we go down the line, I think things will happen and there will be a healing process, but this has been a very rough one, you know that. We started off with 17 people. We're down now to three because Marco got out last night, and we're down to three, but this has been a nasty one and that's why I guess your ratings are higher than they've ever been, you and everybody else that puts these things on and talks to Donald Trump and maybe some others but I don't think some others, to be honest. If you look at the Democratic debates, their ratings are not good. They're way, way down. You look at the Republican debates, they're through the roof. I wonder why.
There's a lot of interest in the race. There's no question about that. There's no question of peoples ' numbers --
Well there's a lot of interest in the race from the Republican side. There's not that much interest from the Democratic side. Take a look at your ratings on the Democratic debates. They're not very good.
Look, the ratings have been higher than they usually are, I'm not here to defend the Democratic side, I mean I've done the town halls for the Democrats, they both did very well, the ratings are up, there's no question, people care. I think that maybe the better point to make about this is why they care. Do you really think that it's OK if the reason people are pumped up and they want to know is because they're so angry, and that in stoking that anger, do you think you're setting yourself up, even if you become president, to inherit such a hostility, such an environment where everybody's against one another in the country, that it's almost impossible to move forward? Are you worried about that?
Well I'm not worried because the people are angry, but they're not angry people by nature, and they're just not angry people, but they're angry at the gross incompetence, they're angry at the Iran deal. They're angry at trade deals. They're angry at the fact that ISIS is pushing us around, we can't do anything. We don't know what we're doing. They're angry at just about everything that's taking place. They're angry at the fact that our country doesn't win anymore. We don't win anymore, Chris. We don't win anymore. When was the last time our country had a victory in anything? We lose on trade, we lose in war, we lose with every, we lose with Obamacare where the premiums are going up 45 and 55 percent and you don't even get coverage, we don't win anymore.
Well, we win every time we come together, right? That's what America's history shows us. So now you're heading into a convention. If you get to 1,237 or if you don't and you're close, you're going to be going to a convention. What is your plan to bring people together there and get many, as you know, who don't want you to get this nomination, to change their minds?
Because I think there's a natural healing process. Once the battle is over, once the war is over, I think there really is a natural healing process and I've gotten along with people all my life. This is actually a little bit unusual. I've gotten along very well with people and I think it'll happen again and I believe it will. Now, if it doesn't, it doesn't. I'll go along the same path, which has obviously been an effective path. I think we'll win before getting to the convention, but I can tell you, if we didn't and if we're 20 votes short or if we're 100 short and we're at 1,100 and somebody else is at 500 or 400, because we're way ahead of everybody, I don't think you can say that we don't get it automatically. I think it would be -- I think you'd have riots. I think you'd have riots. I'm representing a tremendous, many, many millions of people. In many cases, first time voters. These are people that haven't voted because they never believed in the system, they didn't like candidates, etcetera, that are 40 and 50 and 60 years old and they've never voted before. Many of those people, many Democrats, many independents coming in. That's what the big story is really, Chris. I mean, the really big story is how many people are voting in these primaries. The numbers are astronomical. Now, if you disenfranchise those people and you say, well I'm sorry but you're 100 votes short, even though the next one is 500 votes short, I think you would have problems like you've never seen before. I think bad things would happen, I really do. I believe that. I wouldn't lead it but I think bad things would happen.
I know that you want to avoid this situation and I know that you've said many times now that you would back the Republican nominee no matter what happens, but if what you're saying about these people is true and they're looking to you to do what you said you were going to do, if you don't get the nomination, do you feel that it is incumbent upon you to run anyway on your own ticket?
I don't want to even think about it right now. I mean, right now, I'm leading by a lot. Last night, I had five wins including the Islands, as you know. I had five wins and I guess Hillary had four or five wins last night but it's got to be some kind of a record. That's a lot of wins. We had an amazing night last night and we picked up a lot of delegates.
No question about it. Your lead got very big. A lot of people are now searching the math to see how even Ted Cruz finds a path to 1,237. There's no question of the outcome last night.
He can't find a path, Chris. He cannot find a path --
Well, mathematically he could.
He cannot find a path. There's no way he gets there.
He could, but it does not look as good as it does for you.
Well yes, if he wins New York and if he wins places that he has no chance of winning, but I mean he's not going to win New York, he's not going to win New Jersey, he's not going to win a lot of states that he's up against. Look, he was supposed to win the southern states. He was supposed to win Alabama and he was supposed to win all of those states that I won and he lost them in a landslide. He was supposed to win South Carolina. He was supposed to win New Hampshire. And he didn't.
There's no question that the evangelicals haven't come through for him the way he suggested, we'll see what the rest of the map shows. Let me ask you something, Marco Rubio's out. You were uncharacteristically gracious about him last night, given the history that you two have had recently. Would you consider him for a VP? People are saying inside the party, that would go a long way towards healing a lot of concerns.
Well, I just think it's too early to think about it, Chris. I don't like to think about it. I like to get the deal first.
But is he in consideration?
I like him. I've always liked him. Then he got nasty two or three weeks ago and I got nastier than he did, I guess. That's why --
Then you can't be too upset at him. If you got nastier than he did, you can't be too upset at him, and you did say it's time for healing, so I'm just wondering, is he in consideration?
Well, I think he's a fine person and I'm looking at lots of people but I'm not thinking about it yet. It's too early. I want to close the deal. I'm a closer. I get things closed and I want to close the deal first, I think, Chris, before I start -- I'll have this conversation at some point but it's too early.
All right. So talk about closing things. You have a vacancy on the Supreme Court. The constitution says the president's supposed to pick a nominee. He says he's going to do that today. Now it's for the senate to do its job. You say, no, don't do it, wait for the next election. Why? You say that Washington's broken, they don't do their job enough, they all play games, this is one of those games if they don't hold hearings. Why continue the problem?
Because I think the next president should make the pick and I think they shouldn't go forward and I believe I'm pretty much in line with what the Republicans are saying. I think that the next president should make the pick. We don't have a very long distance to wait. Certainly they could wait it out very easily, but I think the next president should make the pick. I would be not in favor of going forward.
No matter what? What if he picks your sister?
Then I would say the same thing --
Oh. You would say no hearing if he picked your sister?
My sister's very happy where she is and she's doing a great job. She's considered a brilliant person and she is.
All right, we know you have a lot to do this morning. Let's end on this note that you began it on, though, as a unifier. You said there's going to be a time for healing. You are the person that many point to as why there'll be a need for healing. So what do you say to those who say, Donald Trump is a divider? He's stoked people's anger, it's working for him, but it will not get him to the presidency. You won't get there by just being negative. What do you say?
I really do believe I am a unifier. I think President Obama is a divider and I think he's proven that and I would have thought that he would have been a unifier but he's been a great divider. We have to win and as we win, people will forget and they will feel better and that's the way life is and it's always been that way for a million years, it's always been, that's the way it is. We have to win, we have to put it away, and after it's put away, I think a lot of feelings will be soothed and we'll win. I intend to win, I hope I win. If I do, we're going to make America great again. My message is very simple. We are going to make America great again. And if I don't make it, then I will go off into the wild blue yonder and I will enjoy the rest of my life and it will be a lot easier, but I think my kind of ability will be able to bring people together but most importantly, it will make our country great again, Chris.
Mr. Trump, congratulations on last night, thank you for being on NEW DAY as always.
Thank you very much.
Yes, congratulations, Donald.
Thank you very much.
Right.
But you know, whatever the establishment is, who can define establishment? I don't there is -- I don't think there is such a thing.
Hey, Donald, good morning. It's Willie.
Hi, Willie.
No, not...
... a little bit of a mathematics lesson.
Right.
And when they leave, I'll get it.
Yeah.
That's the other thing. They'll say, I'm at 45 and the rest are at 55.
Yeah.
If the other people leave, they would get 55.
Yeah.
Well, no, because when the other people leave, I'm going to get a lot of their votes. People never say that.
No, I -- Donald, I get -- I get the math, Donald.
So, it wasn't done in anger, it was just done as a little education.
When you've had a big night.
Yeah. I don't call it precious time. I mean, I just -- I mean, you have to say something. What else? I'll talk about the weather?
Your big victory and the future of the country.
Well, it was a good victory, I talked about that also. I mean, we had a -- we had a really wonderful night, we had a really tremendous success. The Florida numbers were far greater than anybody though possible.
It's incredible.
You know, you were against a very popular person in Florida, the state of Florida, and to have that kind of a victory where you win by just about 20 points is -- was pretty amazing.
Mark Halperin.
And he knows that, he admitted that it didn't work.
Yeah. He does.
I think it was a big mistake.
Mr. Trump, congratulations on your victories last night.
Thank you. And thank you for your nice words, yesterday. That was very nice.
It has been reported that you talked to Senator McConnell. Am I right that you have talked to some other leading Republicans in the last few days?
Yes.
Including some Senate -- senators or Senate candidates?
Yes.
Do you think you can bring those people together?
I think so. Well, I watch your show and I watch other shows and I read things, I read a lot and I see people making statements and then I have them on the phone calling me wanting to get together and we have very good conversations...
Welcome to politics.
... and then I'll see them, you know, continuing, but they -- no, they want to come together, Joe.
How would you...
but my primary consultant is myself and I have -- you know, I have a good instinct for this stuff.
So -- so does that mean a ground -- does that mean a ground war, ground troops?
I'll tell you what it means. It means we have to take ISIS out and I would consult with very good people. I would consult with the best people and I would determine...
All right. Donald Trump, we're being told, Donald, that you have another hit. We will let you go. Thank you so much for being with us.
Thank you very much.
Congratulations on a big night last night.
Thank you very much.
Let's bring in Donald Trump who joins us now from New York City. So, things are looking good for you, as mentioned. Does it mean this will change your confrontational style a bit? Do you have to become more statesman like?
Well, I don't know, Bill. I mean we are doing pretty well the way it is. And I would say that I always like to be a gentleman. But, you know, I started off there was 17 people, all smart, all tough, all cunning and, you know, it's now down to three. If you want to say three. And we're getting down to the wire and I'm leading by a substantial margin. I had a great night last night. We won five, a total of five including the islands. And that was really a great night.
OK. But, you got to be looking out now, I would assume your campaign is, to the fact that you may very well get the nomination. And if you do, you are going to need 65 million votes to defeat Hillary Clinton. Somewhere in that ball park. So, perceptions are being formed now. Many have already formed their opinion on you. Would it be wise for you to kind of come back from the confrontational style and be more statesman like?
Well, I think it would be. And I think I will be. And, you know, I do want to finish this off. I'm dealing with two smart, tough guys. And I want to make sure I end up winning. I would like to get to the finish line. I'm pretty good to getting to finish lines so I want to make sure. But it certainly would be. And I think that's what you are going to see.
All right. Well, that's why I asked the question. So, we are not going to hear Lyin' Ted anymore? That's not going to be with you and Cruz, and that's not going to Lyin' Ted anymore?
Well, I can't say that. I've been -- I think I will save it to maybe after I'm finished with this because you know, I like to tell the truth. We'll see what happens --
Say nice things about him.
We'll see what happens.
I don't know if Lyin' Ted is a good line. You know, OK, now, look, you are in a position where you're being attacked by MoveOn and this other very organized radical left groups. You know it, your security knows it. And your Secret Service knows it. That's going to continue. Do you have a plan on how you're going to handle that?
Well, it is going to continue because the last person they want to face, the Democrats want to face, is me. And the last person Hillary Clinton wants to face is me. And I mean I know that for a fact and people like to report it different ways. But, they want to have me out. They want to have somebody else to run against Hillary, assuming she gets to the starting gate, which is a big question. I mean are these emails going to allow her to get to the starting point.
Yes. All right. The FBI could come in but she is going to win the vote. But, you know, you get in trouble when you react. All right? So the proactive forces are coming at you. And then you reacted and you have said some very questionable things like maybe we punch them in the face or something like that. What I'm trying to get at is --
Yes. I didn't say that Bill.
Something along those lines.
We had a very rough dude -- we had a very rough dude and a massive 25,000 seat auditorium. Every seat was packed. And this guy was very physical with a lot of people. I was seeing it. And all I did was make the statement. I wouldn't mind doing it. But you have to understand where it all comes from.
OK. And I do. But is restraint now required on your part? Because, again, you are going to be provoked. Is restraint required?
I think so. And I think I have been restrained, Bill. You know, we have very little problem. I have had the biggest, as you know better than anybody, I have had the most people by far, not even close, and, you know, we have 20,000, 25,000 people routinely. And, you know, we have one person stand up. And it's usually somebody that is sent in by, I don't know who sends them in. But we have very little problem. Then in Chicago, we could have had a problem, and I made a decision and got credit for that decision to cancel.
Yes. I support the decision.
Because there that was very -- that was really confrontational.
You are going to see them. You will going to see Black Lives Matter, MoveOn, all of these people trying to brand you as some Nazi and the press will go along with it. Enabling them to do their deal. But they're baiting you. And I'm speaking from experience. I don't know whether you remember Al Franken but he baited me. I guess it was 10 years ago. I felt for like an idiot. And he won --
Yes.
-- in the sense that he got all this publicity and he was able to lie at will and do what he did. He is a despicable human being but he won because I reacted to him. I should have floated above it and I'm wondering whether you can float above MoveOn and Black Lives Matter. Is it possible?
I think I can the only thing I would say is this, we have some very big events scheduled with 25, 35,000 people. One 32,000 all sold out. And, you know, when people go in there and they interrupt and they stand up and in many cases they start things like, you know, raising their fists and maybe hitting people, we're not going to, you know --
No, security is going to handle that.
The people in that room won't say it. I know but the people in the room, in all fairness to them, I don't know, I mean, I don't know if they are going to stand for it, Bill. But that's what happens. They provoke to such an extent. But the answer is yes. I would absolutely be able to stand above it.
OK. Because, Donald Trump now is not speaking as the art of the deal guy or the apprentice guy. You are not speaking anymore on that level. Now you are speaking for the -- the United States. You may be president. I mean, so your rhetoric --
I understand.
-- means so much more than it used to me. You know, you are in a different place. A place you have never been in. I'm just wondering how much you have thought about all that.
Well, I've thought about it and at the same time we want to be effective. We have to be effective people at what we do and what we're doing. But I certainly have thought about it. I think it's a very terrible thing going on though, Bill. People will have a rally or they will have, you know, whether it's 2,000 or 500 people and people are set in to those places. Now, I must say, it happens with me more because I'm the frontrunner --
Right.
And they want to make me a little bit more than they would somebody else.
Ted Cruz, yes, they don't like him but they want to bait you into doing something. And then the press --
Well, they don't think that Kasich or Cruz is going to win, so they don't really care.
No, no, no. I disagree with you. It's personal against you. They don't care about Kasich and Cruz winning. They don't like you. Because you stand for border, deportations of immigrants, stopping Muslims temporarily from coming here. All of these things, your opposition feels are human rights violations. They don't like you. That's why they are doing it.
Well, whatever. And I'm the frontrunner. And I think they probably feel in the other cases they may be wasting their time in all fairness. So we will see what happens.
All right.
No, I'm not going to be provoked. But at the same time, you have to take tough action when this happens. But you can't let them get away with it so do you have to take action. And I think you agree with that.
Yes. So, it's a tight rope you have to walk. But let your security do it.
That's right.
And be the peacemaker, that's what I would do.
OK.
Be the peacemaker.
I will do it. I will do it.
Now, Hillary Clinton, your likely opponent, you're going to go scorched earth on Hillary Clinton? I mean, are you going to get in to all the personal stuff with her and her husband and all the scandals? Are you going to do all that?
Well, I think I would rather not say now. It's a little bit early. I want to get it first. And, you know, we had one little run-in about two months ago and I helped Bernie a lot because frankly her numbers came down very big after that. But that was my only real confrontation with her. We're going to see what happens. But, whatever it is, it is. I will do whatever I have to do.
OK.
You know, my whole concept, Bill, is very simple. Hey, Bill.
Yes.
My whole concept, make America great again. That's what we're going to do. She cannot make America great again. She is going to fail on trade. She is going to fail on the military. She has been so bad with the military, it's horrible to look at what's happened to our country.
OK. But just remember --
She has been there a long time, Bill.
All right. You been thinking about it. You have been thinking about it.
I have been. I think about it. But it's just too soon to really let my thoughts get out there. There is some very good people. Very good people.
All right. But isn't -- isn't there some worthiness to having you tell potential voters who you admire? Let's do some history. Contemporary history. World history, American history, throw out a couple names of people that have impressed you.
Well, you know, somebody that I would really love, and I have loved his tone and, you know, I have always said that when they ask who is the best president, Ronald Reagan, I have always liked Ronald Reagan. I thought he was -- I thought he was -- I thought he represented something really terrific. His attitude, his presence, but, you any, that's somebody that I like. There are many people you respect. You go, you know, back in the line. But I thought Ronald Reagan, in terms of president, was excellent. Really excellent.
Who has been the best president ever in the United States, in your opinion?
Well, ever, ever?
Ever.
Well, a lot of people are thinking and, you know, you have a vast array, but a lot of people are saying Abe Lincoln. I mean, he seems to be rising to the top.
That's my choice.
And he wasn't there 15 years ago and a lot of people, maybe you helped him a little bit with your book. Your book was terrific. But a lot of people are saying, are really saying, Abraham Lincoln. And you can't go wrong with that.
How about John F. Kennedy? Did you admire John F. Kennedy?
I respected him. We never really got to see, you know, it's 1,000 days. We never really got to see what the end result was going to be with John F. Kennedy. But he certainly had a style that was good. And I think he was good for the country. He was a cheerleader. You know, to a certain extent being the president you have to make lots of good decisions but you have to be a little bit of a cheerleader for the country.
Sure.
And I think that's where President Obama really lets us down. I thought he would have been a great cheerleader for the country, and it has turned out to be just the opposite because we have a very, very divided country.
What about Franklin Roosevelt, good president?
Well, he was an amazing man. And he was, you know, one of the slightly liberal side, so maybe somebody like me wouldn't like him as much as somebody else. But he was certainly an amazing man. And when you watch, you know, his biography, I find it to be fascinating. Really fascinating. What he went through. So he was something very different on the liberal side, however.
All right. How about Bill Clinton, just policy, not personal. Good president?
Well, I'm not sure that you can separate it honestly. I'm not sure that you can separate the policy and the personal. I will say this, NAFTA is a disaster. And the more you see with NAFTA, that was his baby more than anybody else. And the more you see of NAFTA, what they have done, what it has done to this country, and this is really belated because at the time people thought it was a good thing. But NAFTA has just stripped our country of everything. It's taken so many companies out of -- and jobs out of our system. So, you know, when you add NAFTA to the legacy of Bill Clinton, it really hurts him.
OK. One more question.
When you add the personal stuff to his legacy, that's a disaster.
One more question. I disagree with you vehemently about George Bush/the younger, lying on purpose to get us into a war with Iraq. As somebody who covered that situation, I talked with Collin Powell, I talked with the CIA director, they all said the same thing, the "New York Times" reporting it on the front page that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and, indeed, told his own generals that he did, and the generals disseminated that information. So, to me, all the evidence says that President Bush the younger did not lie. Maybe made a mistake, did not lie.
OK.
You want to backtrack on that statement?
No, I don't want to backtrack. I didn't say lie. I said he may have lied. I don't know. Did he really believe there were weapons of mass destruction?
I think he did.
I know that when his father went in and his father actually did something pretty good because he pulled back. He didn't get into the trap. But I know that Saddam Hussein was taunting the father. You know, the Americans, they were not, you know, they were cowards. He was saying all sorts of things because of the fact intelligently they pulled back and I know that, you know, and you know, also, that the son loves the father and I think he felt very hurt by and it he didn't like him --
But I think the evidence shows --
-- and you know?
The evidence shows that there was a prevailing wisdom within Iraq that was disseminate to do our intelligence authorities that he did have them. So I would be careful. The lie thing I don't think is legitimate. But, look --
Well, let me just say whether -- look, regardless of for what reason we went in, it was a massive.
Yes. It didn't work out, that's for sure.
-- massive, massive, horrible mistake.
OK.
That's for sure.
All right. We appreciate you taking the time. We know everybody wanted you today and thanks for coming on. We will talk to you soon, Donald. Thanks financial.
Thank you, Bill. Thank you.
...punching and kicking a protester?
Well, you know, he was wearing -- he or his partner was wearing Ku Klux Klan outfit. This happened to be an African-American man who was very -- person at the rally who was very, very insensitive to the fact that somebody, a protester, would be wearing a Ku Klux Klan outfit. And he went...
Well, it looked like he was wearing an American flag right there. But does that justify...
Well, if you would have seen him just before he went up the stairs, him and his partner were wearing -- one of them was wearing a Ku Klux Klan outfit.
Well, but it -- and it is the job of the police to arrest protesters who are being disruptive if they are, indeed...
Well, that happened. That happened...
But you appear to be more...
It happened in the Phoenix area, it didn't happen in Tuscon.
But if you don't...
-- I will say this...
-- there's nothing unfair about having...
-- George...
-- a multi-ballot convention...
-- I think...
You know, you have -- you have conservative...
-- you have 21 or 22 states.
What kind of a deal would be in Israel's interests?
I think making a deal would be in Israel's interests. I'll tell you what, I don't know one Jewish person that doesn't want to have a deal, a good deal, a proper deal, but a really good deal. But I would say it's probably one of the toughest deals -- me being a dealmaker, it's probably one of the toughest deals in the world to make, because there's just so many -- there's just so many decades of hatred between the two sides. It's probably one of the toughest deals to make, if you're a person that prides yourself on being able to get people together.
So what does a good deal look like, though?
But I think it's something...
Will -- will...
-- I -- I think it's something...
-- Israel have to give up some land?
-- that we should try very hard to get. And I don't know any Jewish people that don't want to make it. They'd all love to see a deal made. Now, they want to have a good deal, not an Obama-type deal. They want to have a good deal made.
Mr. Trump, welcome to the Washington Post. Thank you for making time to meet with our editorial board.
New building. Yes this is very nice. Good luck with it.
Thank you... We've heard you're going to be announcing your foreign policy team shortly... Any you can share with us?
Well, I hadn't thought of doing it, but if you want I can give you some of the names... Walid Phares, who you probably know, PhD, adviser to the House of Representatives caucus, and counter-terrorism expert; Carter Page, PhD; George Papadopoulos, he's an energy and oil consultant, excellent guy; the Honorable Joe Schmitz, inspector general at the Department of Defense; Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg; and I have quite a few more. But that's a group of some of the people that we are dealing with. We have many other people in different aspects of what we do, but that's a representative group.
It's at 2:15.
2:15. I hear a lot of the press is going to be there, we're going to give them a tour of the building. It's still a little bit rough -- as an example, a lot of the marble surfaces all have sheetrock covering, and plywood covering on them, so a lot of people won't see as much as they think. It'll be like a miracle, you take it off and it explodes, like it's finished, right? But that'll be a fun news conference.
If I could, I'd start by asking is there a Secretary of State and a secretary of defense in the modern era who you think have done a good job? Who do you think were the best?
Well, because I know so many of them, and because in many cases I like them, I hate to get totally involved. I think George Shultz was very good, I thought he was excellent. I can tell you, I think your last Secretary of State and your current Secretary of State have not done much. I think John Kerry's deal with Iran is one of the worst things that I've ever seen negotiated of any kind. It's just a horrible giveaway.
What in particular?
Well, I think, number one, we shouldn't have given the money back. I think, number two, we should have had our prisoners before the negotiations started. We should have doubled up the sanctions. We should have gone in and said, "release our prisoners." They would have said "no," and we would have said, "double up the sanctions," and within a short period of time we would have had our prisoners back. And I think that was a terrible mistake. I think giving the money back was a terrible mistake. And by the way they are not using the money on us, they are not buying anything from us, they're buying, you noticed, they didn't buy Boeing, they bought Airbus, 118 planes from what I understand, but they bought them all from Airbus, they go out of their way not to spend any money in our country. So I wouldn't have done that. And I think it's going to just lead, actually, to nuclear problems. I also think it's going to be bad for Israel. It's a very bad deal for Israel.
Short of nation building, is there any role in promoting values or democracy? Or that's not something...
Well, there is, I just think that we have values in our country that we have to promote. We have a country that is in bad shape, it's in bad condition. You look at our inner cities, our inner cities are a horrible mess. I watched Baltimore, I have many, many friends in Baltimore, we watched what happened. St. Louis, Ferguson, Oakland, it could have been much worse over the summer. And it will probably be worse this summer. But you look at some of our inner cities. And yet you know I watched as we built schools in Iraq and they'd be blown up. And we'd build another one and it would get blown up. And we would rebuild it three times. And yet we can't build a school in Brooklyn. We have no money for education, because we can't build in our own country. And at what point do you say hey, we have to take care of ourselves. So, you know, I know the outer world exists and I'll be very cognizant of that but at the same time, our country is disintegrating, large sections of it, especially in the inner cities.
So what would you do for Baltimore, let's say.
Well, number one, I'd create economic zones. I'd create incentives for companies to move in. I'd work on spirit because the spirit is so low, it's incredible, the unemployment, you look at unemployment for black youth in this country, African American youth, is 58-59 percent. It's unthinkable. Unemployment for African Americans -- not youth, but African Americans -- is very high. And I would create in the inner cities, which is what I really do best, that's why when I open a building and I show you it's way ahead of schedule, under budget and everything else -- I think it was the Rite Aid store, the store in Baltimore it took them 20 years to get it built, one store, and then it burned down in one night -- we have to create incentives for people to love what they are doing, and to make money. And to create, you know, to really create a better life for themselves. And you can't -- it doesn't seem right that you will have a situation like Baltimore, and many other places, let's use Baltimore as an example, there are many Baltimores in this country. Detroit is maybe even a better example than Baltimore. But that you'll have a situation like that, and then we're over nation building with other, with countries that in many cases don't want us there. They want our money, but they don't want us.
The root of many people's unhappiness in Baltimore was the perception that blacks are treated differently by law enforcement. And the disproportionate -- do you think it's a problem that the percentage of blacks in prison is higher than whites, and what do you think is the root of that situation?
Well I've never really see anything that -- you know, I feel very strongly about law enforcement. And, you know, if you look at the riot that took place over the summer, if that were stopped -- it all, it mostly took place on the first evening, and if that were stopped on the first evening, you know, you'd have a much nicer city right now, because much of that damage and much of the destruction was done on Evening One. So I feel that law enforcement, it's got to play a big role. It's got to play a big role. But that's a pretty good example, because tremendous amounts of damage was done that first evening -- first two evenings, but the first evening in particular. And so I'm a very strong believer in law enforcement, but I'm also a very strong believer that the inner cities can come back.
Do you see any racial disparities in law enforcement -- I mean, what set it off was the Freddie Gray killing, as you know. Is that an issue that concerns you?
Well, look, I mean, I have to see what happens with the trial. I --
Can I follow up on that? I mean, to take the case of Baltimore, I mean one of the things that's so remarkable about Baltimore and Detroit is that both of these cities, like many others have been -- it's not as if no one has ever said before we should have economic zones, it's not as if no one has ever said before we need incentives and taxes etc., etc. And Baltimore received a lot of federal aid over the years. So I guess the question, then, is what's different specifically about your approach to these issues from what's been tried in the past, because a lot of effort has been put in just the direction you just described.
I think what's different is we have a very divided country. And whether we like it or not, it's divided as bad as I've ever seen it. I've been, you know, I've been doing things for a long time. I see it all the time. I mean I see it so often. I see it when we go out and we have 21,000 people in Phoenix, Arizona, the other day, the division -- not so much Phoenix, because that was actually very smooth, there wasn't even a minor, they did block a road, but after that, that was Sheriff Joe Arpaio, when the road was unblocked everyone left and it was fine. But in Tucson, you can see the division. You can see the division. There's a racial division that's incredible actually in the country. I think it's as bad, I mean you have to say it's as bad or almost as bad as it's ever been. And there's a lack of spirit. And one thing I thought that would happen, and it hasn't happened, unfortunately, I thought that President Obama would be a great cheerleader for the country. And it just hasn't happened. I mean we can say it has. But it hasn't happened. When you look at the Ferguson problems and the Baltimore problems and the Detroit problems. And you know there's a lack of spirit. I actually think I'd be a great cheerleader -- beyond other things, the other things that I'd do -- I actually think I'd be a great cheerleader for the country. Because a lot of people feel it's a hopeless situation. A lot of people in the inner cities they feel that way. And you have to start by giving them hope and giving them spirit and that has not taken place. Just has not taken place.
My question is not so much why you feel they should be open but how. What presidential powers and executive actions would you take to open up the libel laws?
OK, look, I've had stories written about me -- by your newspaper and by others -- that are so false, that are written with such hatred -- I'm not a bad person. I'm just doing my thing -- I'm, you know, running, I want to do something that's good. It's not an easy thing to do. I had a nice life until I did this, you know. This is a very difficult thing to do. In fact I've always heard that if you're a very successful person you can't run for office. And I can understand that. You'll do a hundred deals, and you'll do one bad one or two bad ones -- that's all they read about are the bad ones. They don't read about the one hundred and fifty great ones that you had. And even some of the ones they write that are good, they make them sound bad. You know, so I've always heard that. I've heard that if you're successful -- very successful -- you just can't run for --
Would you expand, for example, prior restraints against publications?
No, I would just say this. All I want is fairness. So unfair. I have stories and you have no recourse, you have no recourse whatsoever because the laws are really impotent.
So in a better world would you be able to sue me?
In a better world -- no -- in a better world I would be able to get a retraction or a correction. Not even a retraction, a correction.
Well, now, you've been a plaintiff in libel suits so you know a little bit of the elements...
I had one basic big libel suit, it was a very bad system, it was New Jersey. I had a great judge, the first one, and I was going to win it. And then I had another good judge, the second one, and then they kept switching judges. And the third one was a bad judge. That's what happened. But, uh...
But there's standards like malice is required. Would you weaken that? Would you require less than malice for news organizations?
I would make it so that when someone writes incorrectly, yeah, I think I would get a little bit away from malice without having to get too totally away. Look, I think many of the stories about me are written badly. I don't know if it's malice because the people don't know me. When Charles writes about me or when Ruth writes about me, you know, we've never really met. And I get these stories and they're so angry and I actually say, I actually say, "How could they write?" -- and many stories I must tell you, many stories are written that with a brief phone call could be corrected before they're written. Nobody calls me.
Sorry, when you say we don't condone violence --
I say that.
You say that. But you've also said, "In the good old days, he would have been ripped out of his seat so fast, you wouldn't believe it." Isn't that condoning violence?
No, because what I am referring to is, we've had some very bad people come in. We had one guy -- and I said it -- he had the voice -- and this was what I was referring to -- and I said, "Boy, I'd like to smash him." You know, I said that. I'd like to punch him. This guy was unbelievably loud. He had a voice like Pavarotti. I said if I was his manager I would have made a lot of money for him, because he had the best voice. I mean, the guy was unbelievable, how loud he was. And he was a swinger. He was hitting people. He was punching and swinging and screaming -- you couldn't make -- so you have to stop. You know, there is also something about the First Amendment, but you had to stop. And, so, this one man was very violent and very loud. And when he was being taken out, he walked out like this, with his finger way up, like, "screw everybody." And that's when I made that statement. He was absolutely out -- I mean, he hit people and he screamed and then he was walking out and he's giving everybody the finger. And they don't talk about that. See, they don't talk about that. They say, "Donald, wait a second, Donald, don't" --
But your answer is you condone violence when the guy is really egregious and terrible?
No, I condone strong law and order. I'll tell you what they --
Rip him out of his seat, punch him in the face, isn't that violent?
Well he punched other people.
No, I understand that.
Fred, he punched other people. He was punching people. He was -- one guy was, you know, I'd like to say --
The Fayetteville protester who was sucker punched -- he didn't punch anyone --
No.
He was being escorted from police, and he was sucker punched.
No. When are you talking about? When?
North Carolina
I don't know. I don't know which one.
Yes you do.
I don't know. Because we've had so many --
That's the gentleman you said you were going to look into to see whether or not to pay his legal fees.
Oh well that's a different -- that's different from the one I'm talking about. This one was about a month ago. This one was before Fayetteville.
Well, OK, Fayetteville, do you condone violence in that case --
No I don't, no I don't, that's different --
Where the protester is being walked out --
By the way, that's different --
But, yet, you explained it that he was giving the finger and so he provoked it, so he got sucker punched. And you are going to possibly pay for his legal expenses.
He did give the finger, and --
So that's OK?
Well, a lot of people don't -- you know, the finger means, "F you." A lot of people think -- and you have children there, you have a lot of children that go, you know, they go with their parents -- a lot of people think that's very inappropriate. I mean, you know --
It's certainly inappropriate.
Well, I think it is.
But does it -- is it -- does it qualify to --
So do you let him --
-- to punch him in the face?
Again I don't condone it. So do you let him walk out, he's holding up his finger, telling everybody. Same thing happened, you know, the last one in --
I guess the question is, when you then offer to pay the guy's legal fees, isn't that --
I didn't offer --
Isn't that condoning?
No, I didn't offer, Fred --
You said you would consider it --
I said I want to look into it. I said I want to look into it. I didn't say that.
Isn't that condoning?
No, I don't think so.
Doesn't that convey a message of approval?
Don't think so.
To be fair, before every event, there is a public service announcement made about --
It's true.
-- any potential protesters. That is made to everybody that says --
Strong.
But just -- given the Supreme Court rulings on libel -- Sullivan v. New York Times -- how would you change the law?
I would just loosen them up.
Would that be the standard then? If there is an article that you feel has hatred, or is bad, would that be the basis for libel?
No, if it's wrong. If it's wrong.
Wrong whether there's malice or not?
I mean, The Washington Post never calls me. I never had a call, "Why -- why did you do this?" or "Why did you do that?" It's just, you know, like I'm this horrible human being. And I'm not. You know, the one thing we have in common I think we all love the country. Now, maybe we come at it from different sides, but nobody ever calls me. I mean, Bob Costa calls about a political story -- he called because we're meeting senators in a little while and congressmen, supporters -- but nobody ever calls.
The reason I keep asking this is because you've said three times you've said we are going to open up the libel laws and when we ask you what you mean you say hatred, or bad --
I want to make it more fair from the side where I am, because things are said that are libelous, things are said about me that are so egregious and so wrong, and right now according to the libel laws I can do almost nothing about it because I'm a well-known person you know, etc., etc.
Back to foreign policy a little bit, can you talk a little bit about what you see as the future of NATO? Should it expand in any way?
Look, I see NATO as a good thing to have -- I look at the Ukraine situation and I say, so Ukraine is a country that affects us far less than it affects other countries in NATO, and yet we are doing all of the lifting. They're not doing anything. And I say, why is it that Germany is not dealing with NATO on Ukraine? Why is it that other countries that are in the vicinity of the Ukraine not dealing with -- why are we always the one that's leading, potentially the third world war, OK, with Russia? Why are we always the ones that are doing it? And I think the concept of NATO is good, but I do think the United States has to have some help. We are not helped. I'll give you a better example than that. I mean, we pay billions -- hundreds of billions of dollars to supporting other countries that are in theory wealthier than we are.
Hundreds of billions?
Billions. Well if you look at Germany, if you look at Saudi Arabia, if you look at Japan, if you look at South Korea -- I mean we spend billions of dollars on Saudi Arabia, and they have nothing but money. And I say, why? Now I would go in and I would structure a much different deal with them, and it would be a much better deal. When you look at the kind of money that our country is losing, we can't afford to do this. Certainly we can't afford to do it anymore.
About Ukraine, was it right for the United States to impose sanctions on Russia when they invaded Crimea and would you keep those sanctions on them?
I think the answer is yes, it was, but I don't see other people doing much about it. I see us doing things about it, but I don't see other people doing much about it.
And could I ask you about ISIS, speaking of making commitments, because you talked recently about possibly sending 20 or 30,000 troops and --
No I didn't, oh no no no, OK, I know what you're saying. There was a question asked to me. I said that the military, the generals have said that 20- to 30,000. They said, would you send troops? I didn't say send 20,000. I said, well the generals are saying you'd need because they, what would it take to wipe out ISIS, I said pretty much exactly this, I said the generals, the military is saying you would need 20- to 30,000 troops, but I didn't say that I would send them.
If they said that, would you go along with that and send the troops?
I find it hard to go along with -- I mention that as an example because it's so much. That's why I brought that up. But a couple of people have said the same thing as you, where they said did I say that and I said that that's a number that I heard would be needed. I would find it very, very hard to send that many troops to take care of it. I would say this, I would put tremendous pressure on other countries that are over there to use their troops and I'd give them tremendous air supporters and support, because we have to get rid of ISIS, OK, just so -- we have to get rid of ISIS. I would get other countries to become very much involved.
What about China and the South China Sea. What do you think they're up to and --
I think it's a terrible situation, I think it's terrible they have no respect for --
-- and what should we do about it?
Well look, we have power over China and people don't realize it. We have trade power over China. I don't think we are going to start World War III over what they did, it affects other countries certainly a lot more than it affects us. But -- and honestly, you know part of -- I always say we have to be unpredictable. We're totally predictable. And predictable is bad. Sitting at a meeting like this and explaining my views and if I do become president, I have these views that are down for the other side to look at, you know. I hate being so open. I hate when they say -- like I said get rid of the oil, keep the oil, different things over the years, when people are saying what would you do with regard to the Middle East, when we left -- We should have never been in Iraq. It was a horr- it was one of the worst decisions ever made in the history of our country. We then got out badly, then after we got out, I said, "Keep the oil. If we don't keep it Iran's going to get it." And it turns out Iran and ISIS basically --
How do you keep it without troops, how do you defend the oil?
You would... You would, well for that -- for that, I would circle it. I would defend those areas.
With U.S. troops?
Yeah, I would defend the areas with the oil. And I would have taken out a lot of oil. And, uh, I would have kept it. I mean, I would have kept it, because, look: Iran has the oil, and they're going to have the oil, well, the stuff they don't have, because Iran is taking over Iraq as sure as you're sitting there. And I've been very good on this stuff. My prognostications, my predictions have become, have been very accurate, if you look.
Could you use trade to cause them to retreat in the South China Sea?
I think so, yeah. I think so
What would you do?
We, well, you start making it tougher. They're selling their products to us for... you know, with no tax, no nothing. By the way, we can't deal with them, but they can deal with us. See, we are free trade. The story is, and I have so many people that deal with China -- they can easily sell their product here. No tax, no nothing, just "come on, bring it all in, you know, bring in your apples, bring in everything you make" and no taxes whatsoever, right? If you want to deal with China, it's just the opposite. You can't do that. In other words, if you want to, if you're a manufacturer, you want to go into China? It's very hard to get your product in, and if you get it in you have to pay a very big tax.
So, if they occupied what the Japanese call the Senkaku Islands, is that something the United States...
Well, I, you know, again, I don't like to tell you what I'd do, because I don't want to... You understand what I'm saying, Fred? If I... OK, if I say "Well, we should go in and do this or that or that," I don't want to, I don't want to sort of... red flag all over it. I do think this: It's an unbelievable thing that they've done, it's unbelievable aggression, it's unbelievable lack of respect for this country.
This theory of unpredictability, I want to push a little bit, I mean -- there are many people who think that North Korea invaded South Korea precisely because Acheson wasn't clear that we would defend South Korea. So I'm curious, does ambiguity sometimes have dangers?
Well I'll give you, I'll give you an example. President Obama, when he left Iraq, gave a specific date -- we're going to be out. I thought that was a terrible thing to do. And the enemy pulled back, because they don't want die. Despite what you read, you know, they don't want to die -- and they just pulled back, and after we left, all hell broke out, right? And I'll give you another example that I think was terrible: when they sent, a few months ago, they sent fifty troops in. You know, fifty elite troops. Now, why do we have to have a news conference to announce that we're sending fifty troops? So those troops now have targets on their back. And... you shouldn't do it. We're so predictable: "Ladies and gentlemen, we're sending fifty troops into Iraq or Syria. And these are our elite troops. And they're going to do this and that and that and this." And those troops now are being hunted. If you didn't send them, they wouldn't -- if you didn't say that, they wouldn't know. I mean, there are times when you just can't be... You talk too much. We talk too much. I guess they thought that was good politically, to say we're sending fifty troops? I don't think it was good.
Can I ask you... Just going back to NATO, because...
Yes.
As you know, the whole theory of NATO from the beginning was to keep the United States involved in the long term in Europe to balance, to promote a balance of power in that region so we wouldn't have a repeat of World War I and World War 2. And it seems to be like what you're saying is very similar to what President Obama said to Jeffrey Goldberg, in that we have allies that become free riders. So it seems like there's some convergence with the president there. What concerns me about both is that to some extent it was always thought to be in our interest that we, yes, we would take some of the burden on, yes, even if the net-net was not 100 percent, even steven, with the Germans. So I'd like to hear you say very specifically, you know, with respect to NATO, what is your ask of these other countries? Right, you've painted it in very broad terms, but do you have a percent of GDP that they should be spending on defense? Tell me more. Because it's not that you want to pull the U.S. out.
No, I don't want to pull it out. NATO was set up at a different time. NATO was set up when we were a richer country. We're not a rich country. We're borrowing, we're borrowing all of this money. We're borrowing money from China, which is a sort of an amazing situation. But things are a much different thing. NATO is costing us a fortune and yes, we're protecting Europe but we're spending a lot of money. Number 1, I think the distribution of costs has to be changed. I think NATO as a concept is good, but it is not as good as it was when it first evolved. And I think we bear the, you know, not only financially, we bear the biggest brunt of it. Obama has been stronger on the Ukraine than all the other countries put together, and those other countries right next door to the Ukraine. And I just say we have, I'm not even knocking it, I'm just saying I don't think it's fair, we're not treated fair. I don't think we're treated fair, Charles, anywhere. If you look everything we have. You know, South Korea is very rich. Great industrial country. And yet we're not reimbursed fairly for what we do. We're constantly, you know, sending our ships, sending our planes, doing our war games, doing other. We're reimbursed a fraction of what this is all costing.
You know, well, they say and I think this is on public record, it's basically 50 percent of the non-personnel cost is paid by South Korea and Japan.
50 percent?
Yeah.
Why isn't it 100 percent?
Well I guess the question is, does the United States gain anything by having bases?
Personally I don't think so. I personally don't think so. Look. I have great relationships with South Korea. I have buildings in South Korea. But that's a wealthy country. They make the ships, they make the televisions, they make the air conditioning. They make tremendous amounts of products. It's a huge, it's a massive industrial complex country. And --
So you don't think the U.S. gains from being the force that sort of that helps keep the peace in the Pacific?
I think that we are not in the position that we used to be. I think we were a very powerful, very wealthy country. And we're a poor country now. We're a debtor nation. How you going to get rid -- let me ask you -- how are you going get rid of $21 trillion in debt? You're going to be at 21 trillion in a matter of minutes because of that new omnibus budget. So they passed that ridiculous omnibus budget. How you going to get rid of that debt. We're spending that to protect other countries. We're not spending it on ourselves. Because we have, we have armor-plated vehicles that are obsolete. The best ones are given to the enemy. We give them to our allies over in the Middle East. A bullet shot in the air and they immediately run and the enemy takes over. I have a friend whose son is in his third, his third tour over in Iraq. He's over in, I mean he's a very special kid, he's a great kid. But he's over in the Middle East, and, uh, Afghanistan, different parts of the Middle East, actually. And he said to me, I said to him what do you think. And he said, it's so sad. He said the enemy has our equipment -- the new version -- and we have all the old version, and the enemy has our equipment, because they get into a fight with the so-called people like the Freedom Fighters, you know the whole Syrian deal, where we're sending billions and billions of dollars worth, and they capture the equipment. In most cases the shots are fired and everybody leaves. And these are the people we're backing. And we don't know if it's going to be another Saddam Hussein deal, in other words, let's get rid of Assad with these people and these people end up being worse. OK? But he said, they have better equipment. It's our equipment. They have, I guess we send 2,300 Humvees over, all armor-plated. So we have wounded warriors, with no legs, with no arms, because they were driving in stuff without the armor. And the enemy has most of the new ones we sent over that they captured. And he said, it's so discouraging when they see that the enemy has better equipment than we have -- and it's our equipment.
I'd like to come back to the campaign. You said a few weeks ago after a family in Chicago gave some money to a PAC opposing you, you said, "They better watch out. They have a lot to hide." What should they watch out for?
Look, they are spending vicious... I don't even know these people. Those Ricketts. I actually said they ought to focus on the Chicago Cubs and, you know, stop playing around. They spent millions of dollars fighting me in Florida. And out of 68 counties, I won 66. I won by 20 points, almost 20 points. Against, everybody thought he was a popular sitting senator. I had $38 million dollars spent on me in Florida over a short period of time. $38 million. And, you know, the Ricketts, I don't even know these people.
So, what does it mean, "They better watch out"?
Well, it means that I'll start spending on them. I'll start taking ads telling them all what a rotten job they're doing with the Chicago Cubs. I mean, they are spending on me. I mean, so am I allowed to say that? I'll start doing ads about their baseball team. That it's not properly run or that they haven't done a good job in the brokerage business lately.
Would you do that while you are president?
No, not while I am president. No, not while I'm president. That is two phases. Right now, look, you know, I went to a great school, I was a good student and all. I am an intelligent person. My uncle, I would say my uncle was one of the brilliant people. He was at MIT for 35 years. As a great scientist and engineer, actually more than anything else. Dr. John Trump, a great guy. I'm an intelligent person. I understand what is going on. Right now, I had 17 people who started out. They are almost all gone. If I were going to do that in a different fashion I think I probably wouldn't be sitting here. You would be interviewing somebody else. But it is hard to act presidential when you are being... I mean, actually I think it is presidential because it is winning. And winning is a pretty good thing for this country because we don't win any more. And I say it all the time. We do not win any more. This country doesn't win. We don't win with trade. We don't win with... We can't even beat ISIS. And by the way, just to answer the rest of that question, I would knock the hell out of ISIS in some form. I would rather not do it with our troops, you understand that. Very important. Because I think saying that is very important because I was against the war in Iraq, although they found a clip talking to Howard Stern, I said, "Well... " It was very unenthusiastic. Before they want in, I was totally against the war. I was against it for years. I actually had a delegation sent from the White House to talk to me because I guess I get a disproportionate amount of publicity. I was just against the war. I thought it would destabilize the Middle East, and it did. But we have to knock out ISIS. We are living like in medieval times. Who ever heard of the heads chopped off?
Just back to the campaign. You are smart and you went to a good school. Yet you are up there and talking about your hands and the size of private...
No...
... your private parts.
No, no. No, no. I am not doing that.
Do you regret having engaged in that?
No, I had to do it. Look, this guy. Here's my hands. Now I have my hands, I hear, on the New Yorker, a picture of my hands.
You're on the cover.
A hand with little fingers coming out of a stem. Like, little. Look at my hands. They're fine. Nobody other than Graydon Carter years ago used to use that. My hands are normal hands. During a debate, he was losing, and he said, "Oh, he has small hands and therefore, you know what that means." This was not me. This was Rubio that said, "He has small hands and you know what that means." OK? So, he started it. So, what I said a couple of days later... and what happened is I was on line shaking hands with supporters, and one of supporters got up and he said, "Mr. Trump, you have strong hands. You have good-sized hands." And then another one would say, "You have great hands, Mr. Trump, I had no idea." I said, "What do you mean?" He said, "I thought you were like deformed, and I thought you had small hands." I had fifty people... Is that a correct statement? I mean people were writing, "How are Mr. Trump's hands?" My hands are fine. You know, my hands are normal. Slightly large, actually. In fact, I buy a slightly smaller than large glove, OK? No, but I did this because everybody was saying to me, "Oh, your hands are very nice. They are normal." So Rubio, in a debate, said, because he had nothing else to say... now I was hitting him pretty hard. He wanted to do his Don Rickles stuff and it didn't work out. Obviously, it didn't work too well. But one of the things he said was "He has small hands and therefore, you know what that means, he has small something else." You can look it up. I didn't say it.
You chose to raise it...
No, I chose to respond.
You chose to respond.
I had no choice.
You chose to raise it during a debate. Can you explain why you had no choice?
I don't want people to go around thinking that I have a problem. I'm telling you, Ruth, I had so many people. I would say 25, 30 people would tell me... every time I'd shake people's hand, "Oh, you have nice hands." Why shouldn't I? And, by the way, by saying that I solved the problem. Nobody questions... I even held up my hands, and said, "Look, take a look at that hand."
You told us in the debate....
And by saying that, I solved the problem. Nobody questions. Everyone held my hand. I said look. Take a look at that hand.
You told us in the debate that you guaranteed there was not another problem. Was that presidential? And why did you decide to do that?
I don't know if it was presidential, honestly, whether it is or not. He said, 'Donald Trump has small hands and therefore he has small something else.' I didn't say that. And all I did is when he failed, when he was failing, when he was, when Christie made him look bad, I gave him the -- a little recap and I said, and I said, and I had this big strong powerful hand ready to grab him, because I thought he was going to faint. And everybody took it fine. Whether it was presidential or not I can't tell you. I can just say that what he said was a lie. And everybody, they wanted to do stories on my hands; after I said that, they never did. And then I held up the hand, I showed people the hand. You know, when I've got a big audience. So yeah, I think it's not a question of presidential...
OK, let's move on here. Let's move on.
I did feel I should respond. Maybe I'm wrong. I don't know. But I felt I should respond because everybody was talking about it.
OK.
Oh is it?
Yeah. You have a meeting you have to get to.
OK we do.
I'm Jo-Ann Armao. I cover D.C. events. I want to ask you a question about what you think about D.C. voting rights or statehood.
OK. I'll talk about that.
Tom Toles.
Hi, Tom.
I'm Charles...
Yes, I know Charles.
Steve Stromberg, editorial writer.
Right.
Ruth Marcus.
Right.
Fred Ryan.
Right, right.
Jackson Diehl.
Good.
James Downie, digital opinions editor.
Hi, James.
Mike Larabee, I'm the op-ed editor.
Yes.
Christine Emba.
Hi, Christine.
Jamie Riley, letters and local opinions.
Good, yes, yes.
Uh, yeah, I mean speaking again of the system of what a lot of people would say are some of the uglier components of your campaign; a lot of people have said you've been running a very divisive campaign as far as racial divides, you've noted you know your comments about Muslims, about Mexicans, immigrants and such. You have information that the country is becoming browner, is becoming younger, is becoming blacker. What in your vision of president, in your presidency, how would you bridge these divides and how will you address a -- how are you going to run on a message of inclusion of all Americans?
Well, first of all, if you look at some polls that have come out, I'm doing very well with African Americans. I'm doing, actually if you look at the polls, a lot of the polls that came out, in the, um, what do they call it? Exit polls, like from Nevada and other places, I'm doing very well with Hispanics.
I think some of the polls are saying you're doing negatives.
We do, if it's illegals, in other words, if it's everybody, but people that are legally living here, I'm doing very well. In other words, people that are here, like Hispanics that are in the country, I'm doing very well. People that vote. Like people leaving voting booths and all, I'm doing very well with them. I want to be inclusive, but at the same time, people should come here legally. They should be here legally. And I think the reason I'm doing, that I will do well, especially once I get started, don't forget I haven't even focused on Hillary yet. And, and as you know, you know I've had polls that are against me, but I've had many polls that say I'd beat Hillary, but they're not that, that, they don't mean anything now because it's too early. Because I haven't hit her. I've only hit her once, and that was eight weeks ago, but, I haven't started on Hillary yet, and when I do I think I'll be able to make my points. I mean, you know, but, but I think that just to try and answer your question: Uh, I am the least racist person that you will ever meet. OK. That I can tell you.
But do you feel that your messages, your rhetoric, are dangerous and divisive for this country? How do you feel they're....
I don't think so. No, I don't think so. With the Muslim thing I think it's a serious problem. I've had Muslims call and tell me you're right with the Muslim thing, I think it's a serious problem. And it's a problem that has to be addressed. I mean, there's tremendous hatred. Even the, even the guy they caught in Paris. He was being hid out by other Muslims, and everybody is after him, and he's living right next to where he grew up. There's a serious, serious problem with the Muslims and it's got to be addressed. It's temporary, and it's got to be addressed. And you know you may think of it as negative. Many people think it's very positive.
You told Chuck Todd last year on "Meet the Press " that you love D.C., you love the people, that you want to do what's best for them. They think what's best for them is statehood or at the very least voting rights. What is your position on those two things?
I think statehood is a tough thing for D.C. I think it's a tough thing. I don't have a position on it yet. I would form a position. But I think statehood is a tough thing for D.C.
Tough politically?
I think it's just something that I don't think I'd be inclined to do. I'd like to study it. It's not a question really -- maybe Chuck didn't ask me like you're asking me -- I don't see statehood for D.C.
What about having a vote in the House of Representatives?
I think that's something that would be OK. Having representation would be OK.
Last one: You think climate change is a real thing? Is there human-caused climate change?
I think there's a change in weather. I am not a great believer in man-made climate change. I'm not a great believer. There is certainly a change in weather that goes -- if you look, they had global cooling in the 1920s and now they have global warming, although now they don't know if they have global warming. They call it all sorts of different things; now they're using "extreme weather " I guess more than any other phrase. I am not -- I know it hurts me with this room, and I know it's probably a killer with this room -- but I am not a believer. Perhaps there's a minor effect, but I'm not a big believer in man-made climate change.
Don't good businessmen hedge against risks, not ignore them?
Well I just think we have much bigger risks. I mean I think we have militarily tremendous risks. I think we're in tremendous peril. I think our biggest form of climate change we should worry about is nuclear weapons. The biggest risk to the world, to me -- I know President Obama thought it was climate change -- to me the biggest risk is nuclear weapons. That's -- that is climate change. That is a disaster, and we don't even know where the nuclear weapons are right now. We don't know who has them. We don't know who's trying to get them. The biggest risk for this world and this country is nuclear weapons, the power of nuclear weapons.
Mr. Trump, thanks for joining us.
Thank you.
This is your first day in Washington in quite a while. I know there's a lot of focus today on foreign policy. Let me ask you about U.S. participation in NATO. Do you think the United States needs to rethink U.S. involvement in NATO?
Yes, because it's costing us too much money, and frankly, they have to put up more money. They're going to have to put some up also. We're paying disproportionately, it's too much, and frankly, it's a different world than it was when we originally conceived of the idea and everybody got together. But we're taking care of, as an example, the Ukraine. I mean, the countries over there don't seem to be so interested. We're the ones taking the brunt of it. So I think we have to reconsider -- keep NATO but maybe we have to pay a lot less toward the NATO itself.
So you're really suggesting decrease its role in NATO?
Not decrease its role, but certainly decrease the kind of spending. We are spending a tremendous amount in NATO, and other people proportionately less -- no good.
She's talking about you. What's your response?
I agree with her on the last statement, it is nonnegotiable. And frankly, she is just doesn't know me. She doesn't know my policy. She doesn't know what I'm going to be doing, and she certainly doesn't know what I'm going to be saying today at 5:00.
She says you don't have steady hands.
I have the steadiest hands -- look at these hands. I have the steadiest hands -- and far steadier than hers. Look where she got us. I mean, look at Libya, look at the migration, look at Benghazi. I mean here's a woman that's talk. She's just -- you know, she's just reading it off a teleprompter. All she does -- believe me, they write that for her. Look at the job, probably in history -- although I think John Kerry may even be worse, I'm not sure after the Iran deal. But look at what she's done.
What do the Palestinians need to do for a U.S. president to be neutral in trying to achieve a peace agreement?
Well, I would love to achieve a peace agreement.
Back in December, you seemed to question whether Israel would be willing to make the concessions it would need to make to achieve a two-state solution, Israel and Palestine. What are you expecting from Israel, what kind of concessions?
I can say this, I can say this -- I believe that Bibi and I believe that almost everybody over there wants a deal, wants some deal done. That's what I'm going to be discussing in one hour from now.
Which discussions? For example, would you want Israel to stop building settlements in east Jerusalem and the West Bank?
I'm going to discuss that in one and a half hours from now?
Will you recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem?
Well, I'm going to discuss that in an hour, but the answer is yes, I would.
When? How quickly after you...
Fairly quickly. I mean, it's a process, but fairly quickly. I mean, the fact is, I would like to see it moved, and I would like to see it in Jerusalem, and I will be talking about that in one hour.
But on the substance, what do you want to say to the, because those are strong words?
Well, look, I mean, I've heard words. I've heard Hillary's words, which are largely false, by the way. Although I will say this -- we do have to practice vigilance. We have to be smart. We are not being smart. We're being very foolish right now. We can't take in the Syrian refugees. We don't know where they come from. I mean, I don't know where they come from. There's no paperwork. Nobody knows. Are they ISIS? Are they ISIS-related?
Their condemnation, they're not talking about Israel -- they're talking about bigotry, racism, xenophobia or misogyny.
Or let's call it intelligence -- we have to be careful. We have to be careful who we allow into the country. We've had tremendous problems. Look what happened in California recently with a woman who comes in, radicalizes the guy. They walk into their workplace, they kill 14 people. Look what happened in Paris, France. We have to be careful, Wolf.
I know you've disavowed David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan...
I have.
Well, the ADL put out a list of 10 white supremacists, neo-Nazis, they called them, anti-semites, who are out there, working, supporting your campaign.
I just don't know. I mean, you are telling me this, but I don't know why. I am certainly the least racist person.
But you condemn them?
Of course I condemn them. Always. I've always condemned them.
You don't want their support?
I don't want their support. I don't want their support; I don't need their support.
You're here in Washington, once again, first time in a while. You met with members of Congress today. You're seen as an outsider. Is there a turning point that you see right now happening in your race for the White House as a result of your success?
Well, I think the turning point has already taken place. I won Florida by 20 points against a very popular sitting senator. I won other states. I've won now just about 22-plus islands.
... were not the leaders. They didn't come to the meeting. They were other -- they were other members.
The leaders have called me. We'll see how the leaders react, but the leaders have called me. I've been -- I've spoken to Mitch McConnell, I've spoken to Paul Ryan. We'll see what happens. It's a process.
Do you think you should have invited the congressional leadership, Paul Ryan, Mitch Mcconnell to this meeting today?
This was just a meeting. This was a meeting of some very respected people. Senator Jeff Sessions is a tremendous man, one of the most respected senators in the country. And a meeting of some senators, some Congressmen and women. I think it was a very good meeting.
But those are the rules.
Well, it's -- look, you're supposed to have three people, two people, one person. You're supposed to have people. You're not supposed to have 17 people running.
Now, you don't want any violence to emerge, right?
Of course I don't. They say it all the time.
I just want to be precise. Will you unequivocally say to your supporters, you don't want any violence, you don't want any riots at the convention?
Of course I would, 100 percent. But I have no control over the people.
You have a lot of control over the people. They listen -- a lot of your supporters, they listen closely to what you're saying.
Wolf, these people have been disenfranchised. They lost their jobs. They make less money now than they made 12 years ago. People that are working hard and working double jobs are making less money now in real dollars than they made 12 years ago. They are -- they see their jobs going to Japan and to China and to Mexico. Mexico, forget it, it's the new China. You know what, they're very -- they're not by nature angry people, but I will tell you, right now they're angry people.
But you could calm them.
I don't know that I could calm them down.
With your words.
I'd certainly try. I don't want to see -- but they're very angry people. They have been misled by politicians for years, and they're tired of it. And that's why I'm doing so well, and that's why I'm leading.
Do you understand why there's a sense of unease about you out there in the general public right now?
No, I don't see that. I don't see that. I think I'll do very well in the general, and I think I'll beat Hillary very easily. And I think I'll bring in states like Michigan that was devastated by job loss, states like New York.
The sense of unease, some of the words that you've said. The violence at the campaign rallies that they see on television, the riots outside.
We have not had anybody really hurt at these...
You had to cancel that whole event in Chicago because you were afraid people could get hurt.
You know why? Because I didn't want to see violence. I could have gone through that event very easily, and there would have been probably some problems.
But that's not how you feel about women in those words?
Nobody -- of course not. Nobody respects women more than I do. Nobody takes care of the women -- and they take care of me because they do such a great job.
So it was just show business?
It's show business, or they -- I don't even know some of those statements. I mean, I'm hearing these statements. I don't even know what they are. Nobody respects women more than I do.
Why do you keep...
And by the way, I'll take care of women with women's health issues far better than Hillary Clinton, who's a total phony will take care of women -- if she's even allowed to run.
Why do you keep attacking Megyn Kelly of Fox?
Because every night on her show she does negative hits on me. Every single night. And frankly, if she didn't, her ratings would drop down far lower than yours.
Fox News issued an extraordinary statement.
I read the statement.
That would be -- so you're not ruling that out necessarily?
I don't want to rule out anything. I think it's probably unlikely. And I did have a very good relationship. But I also had a relationship when I said, when's it going to come. You know, at some point it had to come. And we were essentially, we're the last two standing, because John is -- you know, not is doing so well. I mean, he's one for 28. He won his state, and not by much. He won his state, so he's one for 28. I don't know, he's in because he's -- you know, he's a guy that doesn't want to get out.
Mr. Trump, thanks very much for joining us.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Wow! What a...
That's something, huh?
This doesn't get old, does it.
No. It's amazing.
You know...
It's amazing.
Well, we've got a big election tomorrow...
Right.
... here in Arizona.
Yes.
Your next closest competitor has 423.
Right.
OK. That was very good.
Who knows?
He should be in jail. But this is a guy, part of a group that bombed the Pentagon, the Capitol, New York City police headquarters, and Barack Obama started his political career in this man's house. He was a part of what happened in Chicago. You've had disruptions at various events.
And he may have written the first Barack Obama book, do you think? Do you think?
The writing style.
Absolutely.
A lot of people have said that.
Absolutely.
I want to take -- I'm just going to talk process, but I want to talk about how we actually do that, the specifics of your plan.
All right.
There's a Politico story this week that, you know, says -- they quoted all these left-wing groups, Moveon, NARAL, Greenpeace...
And they never quote us!
... if you become the nominee -- it's the same playbook every election year. Republicans are racist, Republicans are sexist, Republicans are anti-gay, Republicans want to poison the air and water and throw your grandmother over a cliff. They'll have a Donald Trump look-alike throwing Granny over the cliff.
Yes, I know.
Yes!
But...
I want to go through the list of things you have told me in these interviews and tell me if you agree.
OK.
You are pro-life.
Yes.
You are pro-2nd Amendment.
Yes.
You said to me you will repeal Obamacare  and replace it with health care savings accounts.
Correct.
You have told me in interviews that you will be energy independent.
Right. Absolutely.
But I think this is important...
But Sean, the one thing...
Yes.
The reason they're going to pay for the wall -- when we have a trade deficit of 58 -- because they say, You can't get Mexico to pay. By the way, as sure as you're sitting there, as sure as almost everybody -- they have standing room in the back -- but as sure...
The last -- just to follow up on that last question -- so any time -- because I've interviewed so much and I go on my radio show and then people call in and they repeat what some of the other candidates say or some of these groups say -- and I say, Well, I've interviewed him and this is what he tells me. You're saying this is it. This is your agenda.
This is it.
That's your vow.
That's it. Except with trade.
Because I...
Except with trade.
Then why do they...
Except with trade.
Then why do they say...
Well, they hit me more on trade than anything else.
They'd be your best friend.
... -it have been fine, OK? But I'm glad a didn't.
The VA.
... the Veterans Administration here than anyplace else in the country. So...
People -- people died waiting...
No, terrible.
... were dying -- you -- waiting for the care that they never got.
And there are two people that I've been reading about. I don't know if it's true or not, but they look they're very, very guilty, and they can't even get them out.
Yes.
They can't even get them out!
Do you know why we made that...
I don't know, but there is something to that affect in there.
When we made that deal, they were burning our flag, burning the Israeli flag. They were chanting "Death to America, " and they said the destruction of Israel is non-negotiable.
Yes.
How do we deal, when you look at the Middle East, you have the Iranian-Palestinian conflict, you have Sunnis, you have Shia in Iran, you have the Sunnis in Saudi Arabia. But then you have General el-Sisi who really went out on a limb and took on radical Islamists. But then the Saudis have always been duplicitous. They want to be our friend. They give the Clintons money and other people money. And then on the other hand when they're fighting Iranian backed rebels in Yemen, now they want our support.
Sure.
So what do we do to demand that the Saudis once and for all pick a side here?
OK, are you ready? So Saudi Arabia before the oil crash and now they're still making a fortune but not as much, but they were making $1 billion a day. So we defend Saudi Arabia. And I have many friends from Saudi Arabia, very nice people. They buy my apartments. They rent my space. I have to -- I'm in a different position. I'm always like defending. Same thing with China. I'm always knocking China.
Do they buy Trump steaks, too?
They buy everything, OK? But China, I mean, I have the biggest bank in the world is my tenant. I have the Bank of American building in San Francisco with a great partner and we got that from China. So many different things. I don't have anything against the Chinese, even the Saudis. But our leaders are so stupid that we do this. Now, here's the thing. So here's the thing. I really get angry at the leaders. I'm not angry at these other countries. They're taking advantage of people that don't know what they're doing. Saudi Arabia was making $1 billion a day. We defend Saudi Arabia. They wouldn't be there. Remember the first Iraq war, right?
Kuwait?
With Kuwait, where the -- they came in and they were coming, the Iraqis coming in, and the Saudis ran. I mean, I just remembered it and we had the marines in the background, and we took care of it. But I'll never forget that scene. Here's the thing. Not knocking Saudi Arabia, only saying this. Iran now has Yemen. They want to take Yemen. They want Yemen because of the long border with Saudi Arabia. They -- last thing.
We should make America energy independent.
We have to make it energy --
What do you think about -- look, don't you think the Saudis when they give the Clinton Foundation all this money, don't you think bought Hillary's silence even women in Saudi Arabia can't drive, they can't leave a house without a male relative?
Well, that's a big discussion right now because now they're finding out that Bill would be getting a fortune to make a speech and then all of a sudden lots of positive things happen when she was Secretary of State. And the email scandal is massive scandal where people were sent to prison for doing a tiny fraction of what she did. You look at General Petraeus, what happened to him, what he did was nothing compared to what she did, and they destroyed his life. So you look at it. So it's a very -- it's a very sad situation.
You keep saying, if she can run.
I do say this.
And you've also told me --
But I have to tell you, you would think that if they would have done something, they would have done it a long time ago. They'll let her go up to the gate and then indict her?
Last question this segment. I don't have a lot of time. Who are people that you can tell us now -- we started out with 17 candidates. Who are people that you would bring into your administration or ask into your administration?
I know so many politicians. I know so many people in Washington.
Name names?
Let me tell you, we have great people, Sean. We have great people. I don't want to talk --
Allen West.
Good man she just said.
Rudy Giuliani, A.G.?
Rudy is great. When we comes around, he's great. Bolton is great. There are so many people that I deal with, Walid Phares is great. We have so many people that you see that you know and I know, and many of these people are going to be part, the good ones.
Mr. Trump, good morning. Your reaction to what happened this morning early in Belgium?
Well, I think it's absolutely horrible. You're talking to a great man in Walid, he knows this stuff better than just about anybody I can think of. And you have the right man and I will tell you, I have been talking about this for a long time. And look at Brussels, Brussels was a beautiful city, a beautiful place with zero crime and now it's a disaster city. It's a total disaster.
Mr. Trump -- sorry, go ahead.
We have to be very careful in the United States. We have to be very, very vigilant as to who we allow into this country.
Sure. And in many cases, and I know you have seen the reports, Mr. Trump, where as ISIS has rolled over different communities and cities and towns in Syria, you know, they knock over the courthouse, they take the passport machine and they take the passport documents. And they just print up fake passports for the people who need them or people who got the money.
Right. And they're coming into our country -- and they're coming into our country, too. And we don't -- we have no idea what's happening. Our government has absolutely no idea what's happening, but they're coming into our country, they're coming in by the thousands. And just watch what happens. I'm a pretty good prognosticator. Just watch what happens over the years. I won't be pretty.
Donald -- Donald Trump, I don't think I did a good job describing that to. What I was saying is what do you think of the New York Times? They took you to task about your assessment of Brussels. Were you right?
Oh, of course I'm right. I mean, just turn on the television and obviously look at Fox and Friends, you know? Of course. I mean, you take look at it. Brussels is a disaster and it's been a -- Brussels is an armed camp, and I'm not talking about today. You go down into Brussels now, it's an armed camp. If you went into Brussels 20 years ago, it was like a magical city.
Right.
It was a magical city and -- and now you look at it, it's an armed camp. I'm just looking at your pictures on television right now, it's horrible.
And in particular -- for instance, in the neighborhood where they picked this Salah Abdek-Salam, one of the guys from the Paris attacks, in that -- in that Muslim community, police have no penetration in that neighborhood and no real -- a lot of people don't have a real connection to the police and there's high unemployment, so that explains a lot about that. I wanted to...
Police are afraid to go into the neighborhood and he was being protected by other people in the neighborhood. So here's one of the Paris leaders and killers and he's being protected by people in the city itself. It's ridiculous.
He was four doors down from his parents.
Right. The whole thing is crazy. And it's not going to change. It's not going to get better. It's only going to get worse.
I want to ask you too, because you're a businessman, about the markets because I know the markets are down. Brussels is a hot bed for international business. What happens now going forward from a business perspective?
Well, I think this -- this whole thing will get worse as time goes by. It's being, you know, perpetrated all over the place now. Brussels is in very bad shape, but many cities will be this way. And you know, with what's taking place. It's really the policies of people that don't know what they're doing. It's people that don't know what -- they see what's happening, and yet they allow it to continue to happen.
Right.
And you know, Brussels, I have friends that live in Brussels, they say the place is literally disintegrating. And I'm not just talking about today. I'm talking about general things.
Yeah. Right, that's what they said earlier. Donald Trump, a lot of people listening right now might be misinterpreting your message in the past and currently, that the problem -- that you have a problem with Muslims. You don't have a problem with Muslims. In fact, you hired one Walid Phares to work with you.
Sure. That's correct.
Yeah.
And it's going to get worse and worse. In my opinion, this is just the beginning, it will get worse and worse, because we are lax and we are foolish, we are foolish. We can't allow these people -- at this point, we can't allow these people to come into the country, I'm sorry.
OK, so Donald Trump, let's say -- let's say you're the president of the United States today. Obviously, you would have cracked down on immigration to prevent what you're talking about earlier. What else would you do today?
Well, I would, you know, I guess I would just talk to the people and give them, frankly, a pep talk. You know, we need a pep talk. We need spirit in our own country, OK? We are allowing thousands and thousands of people to come into our country, and we don't even know where they come from and who they are. They're coming in from Syria, they're coming in from different -- coming in from the migration.
But you're going to fix that, you say?
Excuse me?
You say you're going to fix that.
Well, I'm not going to fix it, I'm not going to allow them to come in. That's going to be fixing it, OK?
Right.
I mean, people are very concerned about this and they're very concerned about the security of this country.
Donald Trump, thank you so much for being with us this morning.
Thank you very much.
All right, but let me take you back to my question Mr. Trump.
It's too bad.
Let me ask you this Mr. Trump. They have, in Belgium, a guy by the name of Salah Abdeslam in custody now. He's said to be the man who planned the Paris attacks of November 13th. They have him in custody. What would you say would be appropriate in terms of what they can do to him at this moment to get any information they can about possible further attacks?
Well, I would say they should be able to do whatever they have to do. They have to get the information and I would say they should be able to do whatever they have to do.
If you talk to experts who do the interrogations, you often time a division. Some people think that harsh interrogation technique works and will deliver you the information, and others say it doesn't work. You'll get false information. Are you in the camp that harsh interrogation, let's use the word, torture, works in a case like this?
Yes, I am. I am in that camp. I don't believe the other people. I'm in that camp, absolutely. They'll give him -- they'll read him his rights. He'll sit there with a good lawyer. The lawyer won't give -- ten years will go by. By the time it goes by, he won't know anything because the world will have moved on to an even worse place. Now, I am in the camp where you have to get the information, and you have to get it rapidly.
I just have -- just a couple of seconds...
They want to go by Sharia law. They want Sharia law. They don't want laws that we have. They want Sharia law. You know, you say to yourself, at what point? How much of this do you take? And what we're doing is we're allowing thousands and thousands of these people into our country. We're going to have nothing but problems, as sure as you're sitting there.
In just the 30 seconds I have left, Mr. Trump, what would you say to the American people on a morning like this?
I would say to the American people that we are going to be very strong. We are going to be very vigilant and we're going to be very tough. We're not going to allow this to happen to our country. If it does happen, we're going to find the people that did it and they're going to suffer greatly.
Mr. Trump. Donald Trump, thank you very much for joining us.
OK. Thank you very much.
Your reaction to this? What should be done at this point?
Well, it's a shame. It's a horrible thing and what's going on in Brussels, it used to be one of the great places of the world. I don't know if Gerard is with you. I don't have a television in front of me --
Gerry Baker is here right.
Right. Hi, Gerry.
Good morning.
So -- So -- so sad to see and as Gerry can tell you, and as I can tell you, Brussels was one of the great cities, one of the most beautiful cities of the world 20 years ago. It was amazing, actually, and safe. And now it's a horror show, it's an absolute horror show. And I'm not just talking about today. I'm saying you go to Brussels it feels like an armed camp and even then they can't do much about what's happening. So there's a sick problem going on, Maria.
You mean with Angela Merkel?
Merkel, yes.
In your primary, you know, in every Republican primary so far, a significant majority of Republican voters have supported that position. I don't dispute that it's popular with Republicans. One of the criticisms, though, was that it's impractical. That actually the, you know -- How do you know who is a Muslim, how do you stop it. And one of the problems that people have pointed to is that actually people can come into this country now without a visa. Right? You don't have to get -- They have a visa waiver program, doesn't matter -- frankly whether you're a Muslim, a Christian, atheist, whatever -- you can get -- you can come in under a visa waiver, you don't have to go through the security checks to get a visa. What -- is it time to stop that?
Yeah. It's time to stop that absolutely, Gerry. And frankly, look, we're having problems with the Muslims and we're having problems with Muslims coming into the country and we are seeing it, whether it's California where they killed the 14 people, the two young married couple, I guess she possibly radicalized him, nobody knows.
Right.
She came here on a fiance visa, she came in, they say that he wasn't radicalized, but he was radicalized after he met her and they killed 14 coworkers that gave them a baby shower. They gave a shower for their baby, and they were friends and they walked in and shot them all, killed them all, and plenty of wounded in the hospital. You look at Paris where they have frankly, you know, you talk about guns, but in Paris they have the toughest gun laws in the world and you have a situation there where you have 130 people just killed for no reason whatsoever, just killed. Nobody -- no bullets going in the opposite direction, that I can tell you, because nobody had guns.
What else would you do, though, domestically? Would you -- I mean surveillance, for example. Do we need to be much more aggressive in -- surveilling there has been -- this has been a, as you know, very controversial in New York, Donald, with Mayor de Blasio scaling back the program that the previous mayor and the police department that --
Which was a big mistake, I agree.
You do more. So you think we need much more -- we need to surveil communities much more --
Oh yeah. You need surveillance. You have to deal with the mosques, whether we like it or not, I mean, you know, these attacks aren't coming out of -- they're not done by Swedish people. That I can tell you. You have to be very -- Look, we have to be smart, we have to be vigilant. We have to watch very closely what's going on. We have to look at the mosques. We have to study what's going on. Now in the old system under New York, they were infiltrating mosques, they were getting great information from what people were saying, that we were stopping attacks and let's see, now this current mayor, who frankly is a mayor that he doesn't know what he's doing, he's doing a terrible job according to everybody, but this current mayor ended that entire program.
Right.
Ended it entirely. And that was a big mistake. If you speak to the police commissioner, you speak to Ray Kelly and some of the people that really do know what they're doing, that was a tremendous loss for New York when we ended our vigilance.
Yeah in fact we heard a lot about de Blasio's failures this morning. Two points for you, Donald, which I'd love you to talk about. No. 1, isn't it interesting that now we understand that President Obama will give a live press conference later on today, obviously, he's probably going to discuss the terrorist attack from the brutal communist dictatorship of Cuba. So what irony that is. Now yesterday --
Right. I wonder how many -- I wonder how many Muslims Cuba is taking every year. I wonder if they're setting up a little area in Cuba for the Muslim population.
Yeah -- And we spoke earlier that we know that ISIS has gotten their hands on that passport making machine. Look, Donald, all of this happening on the day of the primaries, obviously in Arizona and Utah. Does this change the conversation? Does this change the sentiment for voters going into those voting booths from your standpoint? How are you feeling going into these primaries?
Well, I'm feeling very, very good. Arizona, I think I'm going to do fantastically and Utah, I was there and I had a great reception and I'll see how I do in Utah. In Arizona, we had -- I mean, we had 21,000 people and we had 6,000 people and things were set up a couple of days in advance. The second one was set up like 14 hours in advance and we had 6,000 people and we would have had many more except that the agitators, I call them agitators, you know, it's a professional organization, but they blocked the road and they blocked some entrances and things like that, but actually they're very safe. You know, despite what you read, these are very safe. What goes on there is love fests, believe me. These are great people that, you know, the expression is "Make America great again." That's what we're going to do. Make America great again. Great people. So, the Arizona is going on today, the Utah is going on today and I think we're going to do very well. I'm leading by a lot and I hope to continue that trend.
Thank you so much, Donald. We appreciate it.
Two thirds of the team. It was a great team.
Apparently, and I guess there are some one thousand investigations going on right now in the U.S. about wannabe terrorists or those who are trying to join the fight. Donald Trump, thank you very much for your time this morning. We so appreciate it. We'll be watching tonight.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Would you continue to support at least a temporary ban on all Muslims coming into the United States?
Well, you have no choice. And you're going to make certain exceptions, and you're going to make exceptions on heads of state. We have a real problem and people don't have any idea what's going on. We have a government that doesn't get it. But we have a real problem, Wolf. And we have a government that doesn't understand what's happening.
What about --
I'm saying, you have -- we have to be smart and we have to be vigilant.
Because they argue, the people who passed the laws that waterboarding is torture. And you say you would even go further than waterboarding? Is that why --
Absolutely.
How far would you go?
Well, I'd go further. And I'll listen to the military people, but I'd go further.
The military people say they oppose torture.
I disagree. I don't believe --
Well, they point out that it's a violation of international law to engage in torture and the U.S. has signed on to these various international treaties banning torture.
Well, I would say the eggheads that came up with this international law should turn on their television and watch CNN right now because I'm looking at scenes on CNN right now as I'm speaking to you that are absolutely atrocious. And I would be willing to bet, when I'm seeing all of the bodies laying all over the floor, including young, beautiful children laying dead on the floor, I would say if they watch that, maybe -- just maybe they'll approve waterboarding and other things.
As you know, Ted Cruz suggested today the U.S. should step up its involvement going into Muslim neighborhoods, as he described it, looking for potential terrorists. Is that something you would support?
Yes, I would. I think that's a good idea.
I'm talking about Muslim neighborhoods in the United States, for example.
Yes, I would support that. Yes, 100 percent.
Mr. Trump, I know you've got to go. But thanks very much for joining us. We'll continue this conversations down the road.
Thank you very much, Wolf.
To me, it seems the president, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are willing to gamble with the lives of Americans. What do you want to tell the American people tonight about why that is so important?
Well, I think -- I think I really have to tell them, and you know, you could say I came under fire, but I've also been praised by many people.
Well, that's true.
Many, many people. Many, many people agree with me.
Mr. Trump, let me -- let me ask you this. Today's attack seems to be retaliation for the arrest of the Paris mastermind, where over 130 people were killed, which happened on Friday, which means there were terror cells...
I wouldn't call him a mastermind. He's a lowlife. I wouldn't call him a mastermind.
I agree. Now, you said that if he was here in the United States -- now, I would suspect that he knows where other terror cells are throughout Europe and in Brussels and in Belgium. And you said that -- and I agree with you -- that we should use advanced terror enhancement interrogation techniques on him. Hillary...
Beyond waterboarding. Beyond waterboarding.
I would agree. He probably knows where other terrorist cells are. Let -- let me...
And he knows the people that are behind it.
Of course he does.
And he's never going to -- he's never going to talk. And we're not fighting on the same plane, Sean. The problem is we don't fight on the same level. We have laws that protect everybody. You know, you can't do this, you can't do that. Don't touch him. Don't hurt him. Please -- in the meantime, they go around killing people. They have no laws. We have the laws to protect them. It's absolutely crazy!
Yes.
Because I can't believe she really believes that herself. She's just going along with his line because she doesn't want to do anything to disturb him.
You know...
So it's a pretty sad situation.
Pretty sad.
Putting it mildly.
Well, I wish you were wrong.
Well, I wish I was wrong, too, but I could see it happening and I could see it and friends of mine that go over there that come back and they tell me what's going on and it was so obvious. So it was sort of easy. But you're right. I wish I was wrong.
You know, Benjamin Netanyahu said to me in the last interview when I was in Israel with him that what was going on in his country -- it was during the war that August -- he said, This is a preview of coming attractions, coming to a theater near you. Sadly, I wish he was wrong, too. Thank you, Mr. Trump.
Thank you very much.
Right.
When I did the one interview many months before it started, it was like, I don't know. You know, this was the first time. And in all fairness, I've been a great businessman over the years. I was asked as a businessman. It didn't sound so good to me.
I'm not...
But I have to say this, there are...
You'd probably be the last to use nuclear weapons...
Nuclear...
-- against ISIS?
-- nuclear.
But you're -- so you would -- you would rule in the possibility of using, right, nuclear weapons against ISIS?
Well, I'm never going to rule anything out.
Right.
And I wouldn't want to say -- even if I felt it wasn't going -- I wouldn't want to tell you that...
Right.
-- because, at a minimum, I want them to think maybe we would use it, OK?
Right.
It's the worst thing when we do these interviews, we -- with everybody, not me...
Right.
They would be dressed, we'd be dressed, we'd know who we were fighting.
Understood.
But with that being said, I don't rule out anything.
Right.
We went after Iraq. Iraq did not knock down the World Trade Center.
Right. Well, that's why I asked about the Taliban.
I'm just saying, Iraq did -- no, because we could have taken out the Taliban without -- if we really wanted to do it.
You're talking more and thinking more about national security than you ever have, obviously.
It's true.
Are there -- what are the areas where you would like to learn more or where you think you need to know more to be president, about national security?
I've had a good instinct for national security...
I'm not asking...
-- so...
-- about your instincts, though.
No, no.
Well, but -- but so you -- there's no area where you think you need to know more about...
I would say...
You would?
Yes.
Right.
But that doesn't mean I'm going to spend trillions of dollars on nation-building.
Right.
Because I think the days of nation-building have proven to be over.
But you don't...
That's the problem.
Whatever.
ISIL, ISIL, ISIL. Everyone else says ISIS. And it's almost like he does it to bother people, OK?
Well, I'm not...
You understand.
-- I'm not doing it to bother you, OK?
No, I know that. But...
National security is going to be a big issue.
Yes.
You're -- and you're...
-- look -- look what happened.
-- and you're -- her...
Look at Syria. Look at the job she did.
-- your -- you're a businessman...
Yes.
How do you prove to people...
I think I'm much smarter than she is. I think I'm much more competent than she is. And I think she's been very weak. And I don't think -- I -- I said it before, I don't think she has the strength or the stamina to be a good president.
So if the election is -- is...
And the call at 3:00 in the morning, I think she's sleeping and I don't think she wakes up.
Do you think there's...
OK?
-- how do you respond to -- to Ambassador Crocker's view on that?
I'm OK with it, all right. I'm OK. We have to be vigilant. We have to be careful. You know, in New York City, we had the strongest -- our police department, which is amazing people. We had the strongest -- if you talk about vigilance, we -- we were watching closer than anybody else and it was an amazing group and they actually caught people in terms of stopping attacks.
But I think you're not...
There's a problem. John, look, there's a problem.
-- I think you're not responding to the substance of the arguments. You're saying Ambassador Crocker is wrong that...
Yes.
What's the toughest decision you've made in your career?
I've made many tough decisions.
So one element would be have -- have the -- people in the Islamic world respect the West more?
I don't think...
Are there any other elements?
-- I don't think you can do anything and I don't think you're going to be successful unless they respect you and they have no respect for our president and they have no respect for our country right now.
Let's talk about NATO. You've talked about NATO with The Washington Post  editorial board...
Right.
Right.
Now, we put up a lot of the money for a lot of countries. You know, we defend South Korea. We defend Saudi Arabia. We defend Japan. We defend Germany.
All right. So should America be the leader of NATO...
I think...
That's definitely.
That one definitely.
But it's possible that NATO is obsolete...
It's possible.
-- and -- and should be gotten rid of?
It's possible. I would certainly look at it.
All right.
But you're a smart guy who's honest. I've watched you so long, including at CNN, and frankly, FOX is lucky to have you.
Right.
-- and Border Patrol -- people that work for the Border Patrol. And I think they're incredible. I think they really want to do their job and they're not allowed to do their job. I think they feel very guilty.
I think there's no question.
I really believe they do a great job. But they're not allowed to do their job, Lou.
Well, you are doing pretty well despite that. But to my question about a standard here, are you going to assert a standard because of the bringing in wives of candidates is so unseemly?
I agree with you, oh, I agree with you. I did -- I wrote and said be careful because otherwise I'll have to start talking about your situation. Now, do I like doing that? No. Should that have been done by him? And he absolutely knew about it. I mean, think of it, Lou. He doesn't know that this is being sent and earmarked to a certain group in Utah? Give me a break. I mean, he knew all about it.
Some comfort for you in that. In the newest Fox poll, just about 60 percent of Republican voters believe the person with the most delegates going into that convention should be the nominee.
That's great. That's great.
Donald Trump, thanks for spending your time with us. We appreciate it, thanks so much.
Thank you very much, Lou. Greatly appreciate it. Thank you.
So, just to follow Maggie's thought there, though, the Japanese view has always been, if the United States, at any point, felt as if it was uncomfortable defending them, there has always been a segment of Japanese society, and of Korean society that said, "Well, maybe we should have our own nuclear deterrent, because if the U.S. isn't certain, we need to make sure the North Koreans know that." Is that a reasonable position. Do you think at some point they should have their own arsenal?
Well, it's a position that we have to talk about, and it's a position that at some point is something that we have to talk about, and if the United States keeps on its path, its current path of weakness, they're going to want to have that anyway with or without me discussing it, because I don't think they feel very secure in what's going on with our country, David. You know, if you look at how we backed our enemies, it hasn't -- how we backed our allies -- it hasn't exactly been strong. When you look at various places throughout the world, it hasn't been very strong. And I just don't think we're viewed the same way that we were 20 or 25 years ago, or 30 years ago. And, you know, I think it's a problem. You know, something like that, unless we get very strong, very powerful and very rich, quickly, I'm sure those things are being discussed over there anyway without our discussion.
And would you have an objection to it?
Um, at some point, we cannot be the policeman of the world. And unfortunately, we have a nuclear world now. And you have, Pakistan has them. You have, probably, North Korea has them. I mean, they don't have delivery yet, but you know, probably, I mean to me, that's a big problem. And, would I rather have North Korea have them with Japan sitting there having them also? You may very well be better off if that's the case. In other words, where Japan is defending itself against North Korea, which is a real problem. You very well may have a better case right there. We certainly haven't been able to do much with him and with North Korea. But you may very well have a better case. You know, one of the things with the, with our Japanese relationship, and I'm a big fan of Japan, by the way. I have many, many friends there. I do business with Japan. But, that, if we are attacked, they don't have to do anything. If they're attacked, we have to go out with full force. You understand. That's a pretty one-sided agreement, right there. In other words, if we're attacked, they do not have to come to our defense, if they're attacked, we have to come totally to their defense. And that is a, that's a real problem.
Would you, you were just talking about the nuclear world we live in, and you've said many times, and I've heard you say it throughout the campaign, that you want the U.S. to be more unpredictable. Would you be willing to have the U.S. be the first to use nuclear weapons in a confrontation with adversaries?
An absolute last step. I think it's the biggest, I personally think it's the biggest problem the world has, nuclear capability. I think it's the single biggest problem. When people talk global warming, I say the global warming that we have to be careful of is the nuclear global warming. Single biggest problem that the world has. Power of weaponry today is beyond anything ever thought of, or even, you know, it's unthinkable, the power. You look at Hiroshima and you can multiply that times many, many times, is what you have today. And to me, it's the single biggest, it's the single biggest problem.
Mr. Trump, just a quick follow-up on that question. As you know, we discovered in recent years that the U.S. spies extensively against its allies. That's what came up with Edward Snowden and his data trove including Israel and Germany.
Edward Snowden has caused us tremendous problems.
Like Israel and Germany.
Right. They're spying against us. Edward Snowden has caused us tremendous problems. Edward Snowden has been, you know, you have the two views on Snowden, obviously: You have, he's wonderful, and you have he's horrible. I'm in the horrible category. He's caused us tremendous problems with trust, with everything about, you know, when they're showing, Merkel's cellphone has been spied on, and are -- Now, they're doing it to us, and other countries certainly are doing it to us, and but what I think what he did, I think it was a tremendous, a tremendous disservice to the United States. I think and I think it's amazing that we can't get him back.
One more along the lines of your ISIS strategy. You've seen the current strategy, which is, you've seen Secretary Kerry trying to seek a political accord between President Assad and the rebel forces, with Assad eventually leaving. And then the hope is to turn all those forces, including Russia and Iran, against ISIS. Is that the right way to do it? Do you have an alternative approach?
Well, I thought the approach of fighting Assad and ISIS simultaneously was madness, and idiocy. They're fighting each other and yet we're fighting both of them. You know, we were fighting both of them. I think that our far bigger problem than Assad is ISIS, I've always felt that. Assad is, you know I'm not saying Assad is a good man, 'cause he's not, but our far greater problem is not Assad, it's ISIS.
I think President Obama would agree with that.
OK, well, that's good. But at the same time -- yeah, he would agree with that, I think to an extent. But I think, you can't be fighting two people that are fighting each other, and fighting them together. You have to pick one or the other. And you have to go at --
So how would your strategy differ from what he's doing right now?
Well I can only tell you -- I can't tell you, because his strategy, it's open and it would seem to be fighting ISIS but he's fighting it in such a limited capacity. I've been saying, take the oil. I've been saying it for years. Take the oil. They still haven't taken the oil. They still haven't taken it. And they hardly hit the oil. They hardly make a dent in the oil.
If you just think about Maggie's question about whether it's the right institution for this, when you go to NATO these days, in Brussels, not far from where we've seen -- just miles from where we saw the attacks the other day --
Which is amazing, right? Which is amazing in itself. Yes?
Mr. Trump, speaking of --
David, does that make sense to you, by the way?
Well, President Obama said the other day in an interview he had that he thought that Russia, over time, was always going to have more influence over Ukraine than we would or anyone else would just given both the history and the geography.
And the location, right. The geography. I would agree with him.
And so in the end do you agree that Russia is going to end up dominating the Ukraine?
Well, unless, unless there is, you know, somewhat of a resurgence frankly from people that are around it. Or they would ask us for help. But they don't ask us for help. They're not even asking us for help. They're literally not even talking about it, and these are the countries that border the Ukraine.
Mr. Trump --
There doesn't seem to be any great anxiety over the Ukraine by everybody that should be affected and that's bordering the Ukraine.
I just had one quick follow-up on what you were saying about the South China Sea. How would you counter that assertiveness over those islands? Among other things, it's increasingly valuable real estate strategically. Would you be willing to build our own islands there?
Well what you have to do -- and you have to speak to Japan and other countries, because they're affected far greater than we are -- you understand that -- I mean, they're affected far -- I just think the act is so brazen, and it's so terrible that they would do that without any consultation, without anything, and yet they'll sell their products to the United States and rebuild China, and frankly, even the islands, I mean, you know, they've made so much economic progress because of the United States. And in the meantime we're becoming a third-world nation. You look at our airports, you look at our roadways, you look at our bridges are falling down. They're building bridges all over the place, ours are falling down. You know, we've rebuilt China. The money they've drained out of the United States has rebuilt China. And they've done it through monetary manipulation, by devaluations. And very sophisticated. I mean, they're grand chess players at devaluation. But they've done it --
So you would cut into trade in return --
No, I would use trade to negotiate.
Mr. Trump, how did you come to settle on your foreign policy team? I know that it's still in formation and you've said --
Recommended by people. And we're going to have new people put in. In fact, we have additional people too. You've got the one list, I think, but we have -- we actually have -- I only gave certain names.
But did you meet with them?
We have some others that I really like a lot and we're going to put them in. Maj. Gen. Gary Harrell. Maj. Gen. Bert Mizuwawa. (Ed. note: It's Mizusawa.)
These are the additional ones?
Rear Adm. Chuck Kubic. Yeah. He's Navy, retired. Very good, nice, supposedly.
Interesting. Interesting.
These are people recommended -- people that I respect recommended them. People -- I've heard very good things about them. In addition, we're going to be adding some additional names that I've liked over the years.
Ah, OK
I have very strong -- as you've probably noticed -- I've had very strong feelings on foreign policy and I've had very strong feelings on defense and offense. And I've been right about a lot of the things I've been saying. I've been right about a lot. And The New York Times criticized me very badly with a very major article when I said Brussels is a hellhole, and I talked about Brussels in a very negative way because of what they're doing over there. And yesterday all over Twitter, as you probably saw, everybody said that Trump is right, The New York Times -- You know, The New York Times really hit me hard on Brussels when I said recently that it's a hellhole, and waiting to explode. And I didn't even realize it, and then yesterday all over the place, Twitter was crazy that Trump was right, again, this time about Brussels.
You have told us a lot about what your leverage would be over China in trade. Tell us on Iran: I know that you've said that you think that the Iran deal was an extremely bad deal. I'd be interested to know what your goals would be in renegotiating it. What your leverage would be and what you would renegotiate, what parts of the agreement.
Sure. It's not just that it's a bad deal, David. It's a deal that could've been so much better just if they'd walked a couple of times. They negotiated so badly. They were being mocked, they were being scorned, they were being harassed, our negotiators, including Kerry, back in Iran, by the various representatives and the leaders of Iran at the highest level. And they never walked. They should've walked, doubled up the sanctions, and made a good deal. Gotten the prisoners out long before, not just after they gave the $150 billion. They should've never given the money back. There were so many things that were done, they were so, the negotiation was, and I think deals are fine, I think they're good, not bad. But, you gotta make good deals, not bad deals. This deal was a disaster.
So, it's a deal you would inherit if you were elected, so what I'm trying to get at is, what would you insist on. Are the restrictions on nuclear not long enough, are the missile restrictions not strong enough?
Certainly the deal is not long enough. Because at the end of the deal they're going to have great nuclear capability. So certainly the deal isn't long enough. I would never have given them back the $150 billion under any circumstances. I would've never allowed that to happen. They are, they are now rich, and did you notice they're buying from everybody but the United States? They're buying planes, they're buying everything, they're buying from everybody but the United States. I would never have made the deal.
Our law prevents us from selling to them, sir.
Uh, excuse me?
Our law prevents us from selling any planes or, we still have sanctions in the U.S. that would prevent the U.S. from being able to sell that equipment.
So, how stupid is that? We give them the money, and we now say, "Go buy Airbus instead of Boeing, " right? So how stupid is that? In itself, what you just said, which is correct by the way, but would they now go and buy, you know, they bought 118 approximately, 118 Airbus planes. They didn't buy Boeing planes, OK? We give them the money, and we say you can't spend it in the United States, and create wealth and jobs in the United States. And on top of it, they didn't, they in theory, I guess, cannot do that, you know, based on what I've understood. They can't do that. It's hard to believe. We gave them $150 billion and they can't spend it in our country.
So you would lift the domestic sanctions so they could buy American goods?
Well, I wouldn't have given them back the money. So I wouldn't be in that position. I would never have given them back the -- that would never be a part of the negotiation. I would have never, ever given it to them, and I would've made a better deal than they made, without the money, and I would've made a better deal.
And to stop the missile launches they've been doing?
Well, it's ridiculous, I mean, now they're doing missile launches, and they're buying missiles from Russia, and they're doing things that nobody thought were, you know, even permissible or in the deal, and they're doing them.
Mr. Trump, one thing you didn't talk about --
That deal was one of the most incompetent deals of any kind I've ever seen.
One thing you talked about at Aipac --
Right, David, so I wouldn't talk in terms of not buying because I would've never, ever given them the money. Go ahead.
One place that might be a good place to start is where we ended up on the foreign policy advisers. Because we're trying to figure out how much time you're cutting out now for foreign policy as you said -- it's not an area you focused on in your business career as much.
Well I enjoyed it, I enjoyed reading about it. But it wasn't something that came into play as a business person. But I had an aptitude for it I think, and I enjoyed reading about and I would read about it.
One question we had for you is, first of all, since you enjoyed reading about it, is there any particular book or set of articles that you found influential in developing your own foreign policy views?
More than anything else would be various newspapers including your own, you really get a vast array and, you know a big menu of different people and different ideas. You know you get a very big array of things from reading the media, from seeing the media, the papers, including yours. And it's something that I've always found interesting and I think I've adapted to it pretty well. I will tell you my whole stance on NATO, David, has been -- I just got back and I'm watching television and that's all they're talking about. And you know when I first said it, they sort of were scoffing. And now they're really saying, well wait, do you know it's really right? And maybe NATO -- you know, it doesn't talk about terror. Terror is a big thing right now. That wasn't the big thing when it originated and people are starting to talk about the cost.
Well it's geared toward state actors and you're discussing gearing something toward nonstate actors. Is it possible that we need a new institution that is not burdened by the military structure of NATO in order to deal with nonstate actors and terrorists?
I actually think in terms of terror you may be better off with a new institution, an institution that would be more fairly based, an institution that would be more fairly taken care of from an economic standpoint. You have many wealthy states over there that are not going to be there if it's not for us, and they're not going to be there if it is for terror. Whether it's Saudi Arabia or others. I actually do think, while I'd like to adapt it, I think you have a different set of players, frankly. You have more of a Middle Eastern player and others but you would have in addition, Middle Eastern players.
Who are not currently members of NATO. You think the membership of NATO is not set up right for combating terror.
No, it was set up to talk about the Soviet Union. Now of course the Soviet Union doesn't exist now it's Russia, which is not the same size, in theory not the same power, but who knows about that because of weaponry, but it's not the same size and this was set up for numerous things but for the Soviet Union. The point is the world is a much different place right now. And today all you have to do is read and see the world is, the big threat would seem to be based on terror and based on what's going on in 90 percent, 95 percent of the horror stories. I think, probably a new institution maybe would be better for that than using NATO which was not meant for that. And it's become very bureaucratic, extremely expensive and maybe is not flexible enough to go after terror. Terror is very much different than what NATO was set up for.
And requires a different kind of force.
I think it requires a different flexibility, it requires a different speed maybe, watching nations or a nation or nations. I think it requires flexibility and speed.
So Maggie and I were at the end of our conversation this morning we were talking with you a little bit about your foreign policy advisers. There's been a little bit of a sense that you've had a hard time attracting some of the bigger names of your party. There were a lot of former deputy secretaries of state, of defense, others were out there. And the list of advisers you've released so far has been very strong on having military backgrounds but not many with diplomatic backgrounds. We were wondering whether or not you are looking for a different mix or whether you're having trouble attracting some of the big names.
It's interesting, it's not trouble attracting. Many of them that I actually like a lot and that like me a lot and that want to do 100 percent, many of them are tied up with contracts working for various networks, you understand? I mean, I've had some that are -- I currently have some that are thinking about getting out of their contract 'cause they're so excited about it. I've had a lot of excitement but there are some that are tied up where they have a contract with, as an example, they might have a contract with Fox, they may have a contract with CNN and they can't do it. They have contracts with the various networks and maybe the media too. I don't know about The Times but it's possible -- I think less likely, I'm not sure how that structure works with the actual newspapers. But there are some that I've spoken to that want to do it but they're tied up with contracts that are with somebody else. There are some that were with campaigns that have now imploded, and I think they're going to be free agents very shortly. Hey, a lot of campaigns have imploded in the last couple of months, which you people perhaps have seen just as vividly as I have. Right? Not as happily as I have, but nevertheless just as vividly. So you know there are actually, there are a lot of people available, there are a lot of good people available. But some of the good people are currently under contract. Does that make sense to you, David?
I wasn't referring to that in the ISIS context, I was referring more in the realm of dealing with our allies, dealing with China, dealing with Japan, the other places that we've discussed.
So ISIS I think you'd agree with me on that and the rest will come. I have really strong feelings on China. I like China very much I like Chinese people. I respect the Chinese leaders, but you know China's been taking advantage of us for many, many years and we can't allow it to go on. And at the same time we'll be able to keep a good relationship with China. And same with Japan and same with -- you have to see the trade imbalance between Japan and the United States, it's unbelievable. They sell to us and we practically give them back nothing by comparison. It's a very unfair situation.
They also pay more for troop support than any other country in the world.
They do but still far less than it costs us.
Would you be willing --
You're right about that David, but it's -- and they do pay somewhat more, but they pay more because of the tremendous amount of business that they do with us, uneconomic business from our standpoint.
Would you be willing to withdraw U.S. forces from places like Japan and South Korea if they don't increase their contribution significantly?
Yes, I would. I would not do so happily, but I would be willing to do it. Not happily. David actually asked me that question before, this morning before we sort of finalized out. The answer is not happily but the answer is yes. We cannot afford to be losing vast amounts of billions of dollars on all of this. We just can't do it anymore. Now there was a time when we could have done it. When we started doing it. But we can't do it anymore. And I have a feeling that they'd up the ante very much. I think they would, and if they wouldn't I would really have to say yes.
So we talked a little this morning about Japan and South Korea, whether or not they would move to an independent nuclear capability. Just last week the United States removed from Japan, after a long negotiation, many bombs worth, probably 40 or more bombs worth of plutonium or highly enriched uranium that we provided them over the years. And that's part of a very bipartisan effort to keep them from going nuclear. So I was a little surprised this morning when you said you would be open to them having their own nuclear deterrent. Certainly if you pull back one of the risks is that they would go nuclear.
You know you're more right except for the fact that you have North Korea which is acting extremely aggressively, very close to Japan. And had you not had that, I would have felt much, I would have felt differently. You have North Korea, and we are very far away and we are protecting a lot of different people and I don't know that we are necessarily equipped to protect them. And if we didn't have the North Korea threat, I think I'd feel a lot differently, David.
But with the North Korea threat you think maybe Japan does need its own nuclear...
Well I think maybe it's not so bad to have Japan -- if Japan had that nuclear threat, I'm not sure that would be a bad thing for us.
You mean if Japan had a nuclear weapon it wouldn't be so bad for us?
Well, because of North Korea. Because of North Korea. Because we don't know what he's going to do. We don't know if he's all bluster or is he a serious maniac that would be willing to use it. I was talking about before, the deterrent in some people's minds was that the consequence is so great that nobody would ever use it. Well that may have been true at one point but you have many people that would use it right now in this world.
They signed on to the most recent sanctions, more aggressive sanctions than we thought the Chinese would agree to.
Well that's good, but, I mean I know they did, but I think that they have power beyond the sanctions.
So you would advocate that they have to turn off the oil to North Korea basically.
So much of their lifeblood comes through China, that's the way it comes through. They have tremendous power over North Korea, but China doesn't say that. China says well we'll try. I can see them saying, "We'll try, we'll try." And I can see them laughing in the room next door when they're together. So China should be talking to North Korea. But China's tweaking us. China's toying with us. They are when they're building in the South China Sea. They should not be doing that but they have no respect for our country and they have no respect for our president. So, and the other one, and this is an opportunity passed because why would Iran go back and renegotiate it having to do with North Korea? But Iran is the No. 1 trading partner, but we should have had something in that document that was signed having to do with North Korea as the No. 1 trading partner and as somebody with a certain power because of that. A very substantial power over North Korea.
Mr. Trump with all due respect, I think it's China that's the No. 1 trading partner with North Korea.
I've heard that certainly, but I've also heard from other sources that it's Iran.
Iran is a major arms exchanger with...
Well that is true but I've heard it both ways. They are certainly major arms exchangers, which in itself is terrible that we would make a deal with somebody that's a major arms exchanger with North Korea. But had that deal not been done and they were desperate to do it, and they wanted to do it much more so than we know in my opinion, meaning Iran wanted to make the deal much more than we know. We should have backed off that deal, doubled the sanctions and made a real deal. And part of that deal should have been that Iran would help us with North Korea. So, the bottom line is, I think that frankly, as long as North Korea's there, I think that Japan having a capability is something that maybe is going to happen whether we like it or not.
OK. We wanted to ask you a little bit, and Maggie maybe you may have something on this as well, about what standards you would use for using American troops abroad. You've said you wouldn't want to send them in against ISIS, that that should be the neighbors. But you did say this morning that if we have a treaty obligation under NATO to protect the Baltics, you would do that. When you think of your standards under which you would put American lives...
Well I think, I do think I'd want to renegotiate some of those treaties. I think those treaties are very unfair, and they're very one-sided and I do think that some of those treaties, just like the Iran deal. But I think that some of those treaties would -- will be -- renegotiated.
Such as the U.S.-Japan defense treaty?
Well, like Japan as an example. I mean that's not a fair deal.
Do you have general standards in mind? And, we're trying to understand your hierarchy of threats.
Are you talking about for...
For when you would commit American troops abroad?
OK You absol -- I know you'll criticize me for this, but you cannot just have a standard. You cannot just say that we have a blanket standard all over the world because each instance is totally different, David. I mean, each instance is so different that you can't have a blanket standard. You may say... it sounds nice to say, "I have a blanket standard; here's what it is." Number one is the protection of our country, OK? That's always going to be number one, by far. That's by a factor of a hundred. But you know, then there will be standards for other places but it won't be a blanket standard.
You had said earlier, I think, when you called David that you had wanted to elaborate on your answer about Israel and a two-state solution. I just wanted to...
Well, not elaborate. I just put it off because I was running out of time and I didn't want to get into it too much because it's actually not that. So should we talk about Israel for a little while?
Sure.
I have gotten some of the reviews of my speech at Aipac and, really, they've been very nice. They were very nice. Were you there? Were either of you at that speech?
I saw it on TV.
You saw the response Maggie, then, from the crowd?
You had talked, and you've talked a lot recently, about wanting to expand laws regarding torture.
Yes.
Much of that is governed by international law.
Yes.
How would you go about bringing changes to...?
OK, when you see a thing like an attack in Brussels, when you see as an example they have somebody that they've wanted very much, and they got him three, four days before Brussels, right? Before the bombing. Had they immediately subjected him to very serious interrogation -- very, very serious -- you might have stopped the bombing. He knew about the bombing. Just like the people, just like all of that people in the area where he grew up -- where he was housed a couple of houses down the road -- they all knew he was there. And they never turned him in. This is what I'm saying: there's something going on and it's not good. He was the No. 1 wanted fugitive in the world and he's living in his neighborhood, and I believe I saw a picture of him shopping in his neighborhood, right? In a grocery store? You know: shopping! Buying food! I mean, it's ridiculous they don't turn him in. Just like in California, the two people, where she probably radicalized him but they don't know, but the two -- the married couple -- that killed the 14 people: they had bombs all over the floor of their apartment and nobody said anything. And many people saw that apartment and many people saw bombs. You know, if you walk into an apartment, Maggie or David, you're going to say, "Oh, this is a little strange."
So would you invest in programs, or help the Europeans invest in programs, for counter-radicalization? For finding jobs and so forth for the refugees who come in so that their temptation to go to become radicalized in Europe would be lower? In other words do you have a program in mind to stop the radicalization?
The one thing I'd do, David, is build safe zones in Syria. You know this whole concept of us accepting, you know, tens of thousands of people, and you see I was originally right when I said, many more people, you know he was talking about 10,000, you know it's many more people than 10,000 are coming in. And will come in.
And who would protect those safe zones, you know as soon as you build one...?
OK, what I would do is this: We could lead it, but I would get the Gulf states and others to put up the money. I mean Germany should put up money. Look what's happened to Germany. Germany's being destroyed and I have friends, I just left people from Germany and they don't even want to go back. Germany's being destroyed by Merkel's naivete or worse. But Germany is a whole different place and you're going to have a problem in Germany. The German people are not going to take it. The German people are not going to take what's going on there. You have people leaving the country, permanently leaving the country. You have tremendous crime, you have tremendous, you know, you read the same stories that I do. You write them, actually, it's even better. So you have tremendous problems over there but I do believe in building a safe zone, a number of safe zones, in sections of Syria and that when this war, this horrible war, is over people can go back and rebuild if they want to and I would have the Gulf states finance it because they have the money and they should finance it. So far, they've put up very little money and they taken nobody in, essentially nobody in. I would be very strong with them because they have tremendous, they have unlimited amounts of money, and I would ask them to finance it. We can lead it but I don't want to spend the money on it, because we don't have any money. Our country doesn't have money.
I wanted to take you back to something you said on China earlier because your arguments about China so far have really been, over the years, very much about how to deal with a strong and rising China. But what we've seen in the past six months to a year has been a China that is economically weakening. I'm sure you see it in your own businesses there. So do you have a sense...
Well, they're down to G.D.P. of 7 percent.
If you believe their numbers.
Yeah, if we ever hit 7 percent we'd have the most successful country. We'd be in a boom, the likes of which we've rarely seen before, right?
What I'm getting at is a weakening China may have different effects on the world and on the United States than a strengthening China. Do you fear a weaker China or a weakening China more than a strong China?
No. I want a strong United States and I hope China does well, but before I worry about China I have to worry about the United States and we're not doing well.
You've given us a lot of your impressions of Vladimir Putin. We haven't heard you very much on Xi Jinping.
Well I haven't said anything. By the way, I've been really misquoted. Vladimir Putin said, "Donald Trump is brilliant and Donald Trump is a real leader. And Donald Trump will be the real leader." OK? I didn't say anything about him other than to say... I said, we were on "60 Minutes " the same night, remember? That was six months ago. But I never said good, bad, or indifferent. I said he is a strong leader, he is a strong leader. But I didn't say that, and I'm not saying that positively or negatively, I'm just saying he's a strong leader. That's pretty obvious that he's a strong leader.
What's your impression of Xi Jinping?
I think they are in a very interesting position. The economy is going to be, I think actually very strong but the economy, I think they're doing better than people understand. Nobody has manipulated economic conditions better than they have. And I think they're doing just fine and I think they will continue to do just fine. But a lot of it's being taken out of the hide of our country and we can't allow that to happen. You know if you look at the number of jobs that we've lost, it's millions of jobs. It's not a little bit, it's millions. And if you look at our phony numbers of 5 percent unemployment, even opponents would say that, and would agree to that fact that the jobs that we have are bad jobs. They're not good jobs, they're bad jobs. We're losing, you know, when you see a Carrier move into Mexico, those are good jobs. We're losing the good jobs. We now have a lot of bad jobs, we have a lot of part-time jobs. It's not the same country. We're losing our companies. I mean when we lose Pfizer to Ireland, when we lose Ford and Carrier and many others to, Nabisco as an example from Chicago to Mexico, when we lose all of these companies going to Mexico and to many other places, we're going to end up having no comp -- we're going to have nothing left. And it has to be stopped, and it has to be stopped fast and I know how to stop it. Nobody else, the politicians don't know how to stop it. And besides that the politicians are all taken care of by the special interests and the lobbyists. Lobbyists for hire. And somebody will get to them and they will pay them a lot of money and the politicians will not do what they have to do, which is keep companies in this country. Those companies that want to leave will get to the lobbyists and the special interests and those politicians will do what they want them to do, which is not in the interest of our country. OK
Mr. Trump, I have heard you say for years now, including at your CPAC speech back in 2011, "Take the oil." That America should have taken the oil from Iraq.
I've said it for years.
Why should the American...?
Originally I didn't say it. Originally I said, "Don't go into Iraq."
Right.
Now, we went in, we destroyed a military base that was equal to, if not greater than, Iran. And we've destroyed that military, and they were holding each other off for many, you know for decades, decades, and we destroyed one of those military powers. And I said don't go in because if you dest -- now, I didn't know that they didn't have weapons of mass destruction. But on top of everything else they had no weapons of mass destruction.
Well, but sir, why should the American approach to rebuilding Iraq, or other countries where we have shed blood, why should that differ from how we rebuilt postwar Japan and Germany in the Marshall Plan?
Well it was much different. We rebuild Iraq and it gets blown up. We build a school? Gets blown up. Build it again? Gets blown up. You know, it's a mess. I mean you have government that's totally corrupt. The country is totally, totally corrupt and corruptible. The leader, I mean one of the big decisions that was made putting the people in charge of Iraq that were in charge of Iraq, and they were exclusionary. They excluded people that ultimately, you know large groups of people, that ultimately became ISIS. Became stronger than them. And the sad thing is, I always talk about the bad deal that we made with Iran as being one of the worst deals, actually the worst deal is what we've done again involving Iran, we've destroyed the military capability of Iraq and destroyed Iraq, period, and Iran is now going to take over Iraq, they've essentially already done that in my opinion, but they're going to officially take over Iraq in the very near future. And I mean Iraqis were already reporting to Iran, but Iran is going to take over Iraq, they've wanted to do it for decades. They're going to take over Iraq, they're going to take the oil reserves which are the second biggest in the world, extremely high quality oil under the ground, extremely high quality, they're going to take all of that over because of us. Because we destroyed --
But Mr. Trump you've argued many times that you don't want to have ground troops, but "We take the oil " implies you're going to have to go in there and take it by force, defend it --
Well what I said is, I said when we left that we should have taken the oil.
If you want to take the oil today you're going to have to go into a country that is now an ally, Iraq, even if it's a dysfunctional one, put your troops on the ground.
Yeah, yeah, OK. Ready? I said take the oil. I've been saying that for years. And many very smart scholars and military scholars said that'd be a great thing to do, but people didn't do it. So, but I have been saying that for years, I'm glad you know that. At least four or five years. When we left I said take the oil. We shouldn't have been there, we shouldn't have destroyed the country, and Saddam Hussein was a bad guy but he was good at one thing: Killing terrorists. He killed terrorists like nobody, all right? Now it's Harvard of terrorism. You want to be a terrorist you go to Iraq. But he killed terrorists. OK, so we destroyed that. By the way, bad guy, just so you know, officially, I want to say that, bad guy, but it was a lot better of situation than we have right now. And he did not knock down the World Trade Center, OK? So officially speaking, he did not, Iraq did not knock down the World Trade center. We went in there after the World Trade Center, well he didn't knock down the World Trade Center, so you could say why are we doing this, all right, that was another thing. I never felt that he did it, and it turned out that he didn't. And it'll be very interesting when those documents are opened up and released in the future, I think maybe they should be opened up and released sooner rather than later.
You mean the House, the House and Senate report?
Yes, yes, exactly. It'd be very interesting to see because they must know. They must know, if they're anything, they must know what happened in terms of who were the people. But it wasn't Iraq, OK? You're not going to find that it was Iraq. So it was very faulty, but I was, I was talking about, I was talking about taking the oil, now we have a different situation because now we have to go in again and start fighting, you know, at that time we had it and we should've kept it. Now I would say knock the hell out of the oil and do it because it's a primary source of money for ISIS.
So in other words you don't want to take the oil right now, you want to just destroy the oil fields.
Well now, we have to destroy the oil. We should've taken it and we would've have it. Now we have to destroy the oil. We don't do it, I just can't believe we don't do it.
So you know Mr. Trump, from listening and enjoying these two conversations we've had today which have been extremely interesting, I've been trying to sort of fit where your worldview and your philosophy here, your doctrine fits in with sort of the previous Republican mainlines of inquiry. And so if you think back to George H. W. Bush, the most recent President Bush's father, he was an internationalist who was in the realist school, he wanted to sort of change the foreign policy of other nations but you didn't see him messing inside those countries and then you had a group of people around --
Well he did the right thing, David, he did the right thing. He went in, he knocked the hell out of Iraq and then he let it go, OK? He didn't go in. Now I don't know was that Schwarzkopf, was that, was that --
It was George W. Bush himself.
Or maybe it was him, but he didn't go in, he didn't get into the quicksand, right? He didn't get into the quicksand and I mean, history will show that he was right. And with that Saddam Hussein overplayed his card more than any human being I think I've ever seen. Instead of saying "Wow, I got lucky " that they didn't come in and take this all away from me. He should've just relaxed a little bit, OK? And instead he taunted Bush Sr. He taunted him. And Bush Jr. loves his father and didn't like what was happening, but I remember very vividly how Saddam Hussein was taunting, absolutely taunting, saying we have beaten the Americans, you know, meaning they didn't come in so he would tell everybody he beat them. Do you remember that, right?
I do indeed.
And he was taunting to them, he was saying, and even I used to say "Wow " because I knew that we could've gone further. We went in for a short period of time and just knocked the hell out of them and then went back, sort of gave them a lesson, but we didn't destroy the country, we didn't destroy the grid, we didn't, you know, there was something left. There was a lot left. And instead of just sort of saying he got lucky and to himself, just going about, he was taunting the Bushes. And Junior said, "Well I'm not going to take it " and he went in. And you know, look that was --
There was something else to George W. Bush, Bush 43's philosophy. If we believed that his father was an internationalist, I think it's fair to say, at least a lot of the people around George W. Bush were transformational, they actually wanted to change the nature of regime. You heard this in George W. Bush's second inaugural address.
Yeah.
What you are describing to us, I think is something of a third category, but tell me if I have this right, which is much more of a, if not isolationist, then at least something of "America First " kind of approach, a mistrust of many foreigners, both our adversaries and some of our allies, a sense that they've been freeloading off of us for many years.
Correct. OK? That's fine.
OK? Am I describing this correctly here?
I'll tell you -- you're getting close. Not isolationist, I'm not isolationist, but I am "America First." So I like the expression. I'm "America First." We have been disrespected, mocked, and ripped off for many many years by people that were smarter, shrewder, tougher. We were the big bully, but we were not smartly led. And we were the big bully who was -- the big stupid bully and we were systematically ripped off by everybody. From China to Japan to South Korea to the Middle East, many states in the Middle East, for instance, protecting Saudi Arabia and not being properly reimbursed for every penny that we spend, when they're sitting with trillions of dollars, I mean they were making a billion dollars a day before the oil went down, now they're still making a fortune, you know, their oil is very high and very easy to get it, very inexpensive, but they're still making a lot of money, but they were making a billion dollars a day and we were paying leases for bases? We're paying leases, we're paying rent? OK? To have bases over there? The whole thing is preposterous. So we had, so America First, yes, we will not be ripped off anymore. We're going to be friendly with everybody, but we're not going to be taken advantage of by anybody. We won't be isolationists -- I don't want to go there because I don't believe in that. I think we'll be very worldview, but we're not going to be ripped off anymore by all of these countries. I mean think of it. We have $21 trillion, essentially, very shortly, we'll be up to $21 trillion in debt. OK? A lot of that is just all of these horrible, horrible decisions. You know, I'll give you another one, I talked about NATO and we fund disproportionately, the United Nations, we get nothing out of the United Nations other than good real estate prices. We get nothing out of the United Nations. They don't respect us, they don't do what we want, and yet we fund them disproportionately again. Why are we always the ones that funds everybody disproportionately, you know? So everything is like that. There's nothing that's not like that. That's why if I win and if I go in, it's always never sounds -- I have a woman who came up to me, I tell this story, she said "Mr. Trump, I think you're great, I think you're going to be a great president, but I don't like what you say I got to make America rich again." But you can't make America great again unless you make it rich again, in other words, we're a poor nation, we're a debtor nation, we don't have the money to do, we don't have the money to fix our military and the reason we don't is because of the fact that because of all of the things we've been talking about for the last 25 min and other things.
Mr. Trump, you -- I was looking back at your speech in New Hampshire back in 1987 when you were releasing "The Art of the Deal " and a lot of your concerns are very similar to the ones you're voicing now.
Right, even similar countries.
Right, and I'm just wondering what is the era when you think the United States last had the right balance, either in terms of defense footprint or in terms of trade?
Well sometime long before that. Because one of the presidents that I really liked was Ronald Reagan but I never felt on trade we did great. OK? So it was actually, it would be long before that.
So was it Eisenhower, was it Truman, was it F.D.R.?
No if you really look at it, it was the turn of the century, that's when we were a great, when we were really starting to go robust. But if you look back, it really was, there was a period of time when we were developing at the turn of the century which was a pretty wild time for this country and pretty wild in terms of building that machine, that machine was really based on entrepreneurship etc, etc. And then I would say, yeah, prior to, I would say during the 1940s and the late '40s and '50s we started getting, we were not pushed around, we were respected by everybody, we had just won a war, we were pretty much doing what we had to do, yeah around that period.
So basically Truman, Eisenhower, the beginning of the 1947 national security reviews, that's the period?
Yes, yes. Because as much as I liked Ronald Reagan, he started Nafta, now Clinton really was the one that -- Nafta has been a disaster for our country, OK, and Clinton is the one as you know that got it done, but it was conceived even before Clinton, but you could say that maybe those people didn't want done what was ultimately signed because it was changed a lot by the time it got finalized. But Nafta has been a disaster for our country.
But you think of that period time that you most admire: late '40s, early '50s, it was also the most terrifying time with the build up of the Cold War, it's when the Russians got nuclear weapons, we got into an arms race, we were --
But David, a lot of that was just pure technology. The technology was really coming in at that time. And so a lot of that was just timing of technology.
It was also a period of time when we were threatening to use nuclear weapons against the North Koreans and the Chinese in the war. Was that approach you saw of Douglas MacArthur's approach at that time, so forth, is that what you're admiring?
Well I was a fan as you probably know, I was a fan of Douglas MacArthur. I was a fan of George Patton. If we had Douglas MacArthur today or if we had George Patton today and if we had a president that would let them do their thing you wouldn't have ISIS, OK? You wouldn't be talking about ISIS right now, we'd be talking about something else, but you wouldn't be talking about ISIS right now. So I was a fan of Douglas MacArthur, I was a fan of -- as generals -- I was a fan of George Patton. We don't have, we don't have seemingly those people today, now I know they exist, I know we have some very, I know the Air Force Academy and West Point and Annapolis, I know that great people come out of those schools. A lot of times the people that get to the top aren't necessarily those people anymore because they're politically correct. George Patton was not a politically correct person.
Yeah I think we can all agree on that.
He was a great general and his soldiers would do anything for him.
But the other day, I'm sorry, this morning, you suggested to us you would only use nuclear weapons as a last resort.
Totally last resort.
And what did Douglas MacArthur advocate?
I would hate, I would hate --
General MacArthur wanted to go use them against the Chinese and the North Koreans, not as a last resort.
That's right. He did. Yes, well you don't know if he wanted to use them but he certainly said that at least.
He certainly asked Harry Truman if he could.
Yeah, well, OK. He certainly talked it and was he doing that to negotiate, was he doing that to win? Perhaps. Perhaps. Was he doing that for what reason? I mean, I think he played, he did play the nuclear card but he didn't use it, he played the nuclear card. He talked the nuclear card, did he do that to win? Maybe, maybe, you know, maybe that's what got him victory. But in the meantime he didn't use them. So, you know. So, we need a different mind set. So you talked about torture before, well what did it say -- well I guess you had enough and I hope you're going to treat me fairly and if you're not it'll be forgotten in three or four days and that'll be the story. It is a crazy world out there, I've never seen anything like it, the volume of press that I'm getting is just crazy. It's just absolutely crazy, but hopefully you'll treat me fairly, I do know my subject and I do know that our country cannot continue to do what it's doing. See, I know many people from China, I know many people from other countries, I deal at a very high level with people from various countries because I've become very international. I'm all over the world with deals and people and they can't believe what their countries get away with. I can tell you people from China cannot believe what their country's, what their country's getting away with. At let's say free trade, where, you know, it's free there but it's not free here. In other words, we try sell -- it's very hard for us to do business in China, it's very easy for China to do business with us. Plus with us there's a tremendous tax that we pay when we go into China, where's when China sells to us there's no tax. I mean, it's a whole double standard, it's so crazy, and they cannot believe they get away with it, David. They cannot believe they get away with it. They are shocked, and I'm talking about people at the highest level, people at -- the richest people, people with great influence over, you know, together with the leaders and they cannot believe it. Mexico can't believe what they get away with. When I talked about Mexico and I talked about they will build a wall, when you look at the trade deficit we have with Mexico it's very easy, it's a tiny fraction of what the cost of the wall is. The wall is a tiny fraction of what the cost of the deficit is. When people hear that they say "Oh now I get it." They don't get it. But Mexico will pay for the wall. But they can't believe what they get away with. There's such a double standard. With many countries. It's almost, we do well with almost nobody anymore and a lot of that is because of politics as we know it, political hacks get appointed to negotiate with the smartest people in China, when we negotiate deals with China, China is putting the smartest people in all of China on that negotiation, we're not doing that. So anyway, I hope you guys are happy.
And Donald Trump joins me on the phone right now. Mr. Trump, thank you and happy Easter.
OK, you too.
Congratulations.
Thank you. That's very exciting. Very good.
How did it happen?
Well, it was -- I...
Well, that's fantastic and it looks like Ivanka is doing great. So probably for the moment, Theodore is your favorite grandchild. We're going to get to the controversy revolving around that in just a moment.
OK.
Yeah. San Bernardino.
It is just insane what this man is saying.
Right.
And it's going to lead -- I mean, you talk about downfall. This could lead to the downfall of the greatest nation on Earth.
Right. But for -- right.
And frankly, other people should also bear the brunt. Why are we paying so much?
You're right -- I just found out that we pay for 72 percent of all defense costs, and only 5 of the 28 nations pay what they're required to do, and that's 2 percent of their GDP on defense.
Right.
And it turns out you're right about that. But in terms of NATO, with the reinvigorated Russian aggression in the area, it's the only thing that keeps these Eastern European nation from being overrun.
Brian, I don't mind NATO per se, but it has to be reconstituted. It has to be modernized. You know, we're dealing with NATO from the days of the Soviet Union, which no longer exists.
He told us he didn't on this couch.
He's lying. That's why everybody calls him Lyin' Ted Cruz. He's a liar, I think...
We only have 30 seconds...
I just want to tell you, I had nothing to do with that story.
Right...
Absolutely zero.
But we're saying -- we're saying -- you're saying he's weak, he's saying you're weak. Will you debate Senator Cruz on the issues as opposed to the wives stuff?
I'm saying that Ted Cruz has made this up because he needs it politically because he's losing so badly. It's very easy. And he's doing very badly and he's choking, and he's -- and he's making things up. He's screaming about -- I had nothing to do with the National Enquirer story, and frankly, I hope it's not true because it's pretty bad. I hope it's not true.
Donald Trump, thank you. Congratulations on being a grandfather.
Thank you very much.
So, let me ask you, Hillary Clinton say how tall this wall have to be to stop the internet from coming in. What was she alluding to? I'm trying to figure that out. Clearly your wall means keeping the illegals from crossing the border. Where is she going with this?
She is trying to be cute. She is mentioning something which is a very different subject. And frankly, that's something probably that should also be discussed. But she is mentioning something that is a totally different subject. We need it. We have drugs pouring into our country. It's poisoning the blood of our youth. We have people coming in and the people coming in you see what's happening. You look at the crime statistics. And we need the wall. We also need to let our border patrol do their job. They want to do the job. They are not allowed to do the job.
Donald, Hillary Clinton, you have donate to Hillary Clinton in the past and she has been trashing you fairly heavily lately. A, do you regret donating to her prior campaigns? Number one, and number two, do you want her to give the money back or donate the money somewhere?
Well, you know, they call me a world class businessman. I built a great, great company. I filed my papers and everybody is amazed how big, how strong, how good it is, how little debt, the cash flow, the quality of the assets, iconic assets and this is what our country needs. I need this thinking. But as a businessman that deals all over the world, you give. I mean, this is very standard. You help people from Republicans to Democrats. And I think it's very well accepted even within the Republican Party. That's why I'm leading by so much.
Do you regret donating to her campaign though?
I don't regret anything. That's the way it is. I mean, when I was a businessman you give to everybody. You are friends with everybody. You get along with everybody. And that's the way it is. And when you are running for office or when you are not in the world of business, where you don't have to go all over the world and you don't need recommendations and other things, I mean, it's different. But when you are a businessman, many businessmen they give to everybody. They keep everybody happy. Everybody loves them. And maybe it's a good system and maybe it's not a good system. But that's the system in which I was under. And I thrived.
All right. Let me try to focus one of the other things you gave 100 minute presentation, I believe that's what it was on foreign policy. And you talked a little bit about China. Now we all know where you stand on China. We're concerned about the trade imbalance with China, I understand that. China is expanding into South China Sea. They are building islands and they're basically declaring their ownership of the area. Sovereign to China. How would President Trump stop that spread of China into the South China Sea without alienating one of our biggest trading partners?
Well, first of all, you don't want to really give all your cards. You are running for office. You may be in a position I'm leading by a lot, and you may be in a position where you want to be negotiating with them. You don't like giving your cards. But I will tell you this. We have tremendous power over China because they are ripping us like nobody has ever ripped us monetarily before. China is taking advantage of us because we have leaders that don't know what they're doing. We don't use our best business minds. We use political hacks to negotiate deals. And we have rebuilt China with the money they have sucked out of our country, including the jobs and the manufacturing that they have taken out of our country. We have tremendous power over China economically. And we have tremendous power --
Had you do you tell them to stop the spread?
You are not going to start World --
Right.
We don't use our people. We don't use our -- we don't use our best and our smartest. We have tremendous power over China. And, frankly, we have tremendous power over many people economically, we just don't know how to use that power and we haven't used it we just don't have the talent in the top positions.
Donald, you mentioned using some of that economic power over Japan and South Korea saying, hey, look, we have put troops there, we have protected you, now it's time for you to pay back through either cash or some other methods? What are your thoughts there and --
Well, we are not reimbursed.
-- specifically to North Korea?
We are not reimbursed. You know, $19 trillion going up to 21 trillion because of the horrible budget deal that was recently made. The omnibus budget. So we're going to be at $21 trillion very soon. And we are not reimbursed properly for what we do. I mean, we have 28,000 soldiers on the line between North and South Korea. Every time the north raises its head with their young dictator, every time we send our ships, we send our planes, now, South Korea, and I do business with them. They are wonderful people. We have good relationships, but they know themselves what they are getting.
Right. But don't we get something out of there too though, Donald? Don't we get when we have a true presidents in this foreign countries, allies on their land. We can keep an eye on maybe some unfriendly companies that they're adjacent to.
We get nothing out of it. In my opinion, we get very, very little out of it. What they should do is at least reimburse us or reimburse us properly in a proper amount. We can't -- this isn't 30 or 40 years ago where we were a rich nation. We are a debtor nation right now. We owe China $1.7 trillion. We owe Japan $1.5 trillion. And here we are doing deals with Japan since it's -- by the millions. We can't do business that way anymore. We need strength and we have to make ourselves solid again financially. We are a country that is on the brink. And we are sitting on top of a big, beautiful bubble. And if it pops, it's going to be a very ugly situation.
All right. I have to get this question in, I've been thinking about it for months now. Donald, one word, is it better to be loved or feared?
Well, I'd rather be respected than both. You want to be respected. And I think that's what's happened. And that's why I'm by far the number one frontrunner.
OK.
And we have Cruz left but by far the number one. I think the word respect is maybe the best of all in terms of leadership.
Right. Donald, I am going to have to say thank you very much. And by the way, congratulations on your grand baby. We really appreciate your time. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much. Thank you, Eric.
Hey, how are you doing? Nice to see you.
Thank you very much.
Have a seat.
Thank you.
Let me ask you about Lewandowski. Initially your campaign said this never happened, there was no video of it. You came out and said you thought this person was, perhaps, making it up, this reporter. Lewandowski, himself, tweeted saying, I never met this reporter, I never touched this person; now the videotape shows he clearly did touch this person. Whether or not you think it was battery or not...
Touch -- I don't know what touch means. I looked...
No, that's not true. She says her story has remained exactly the same. She was knocked a little bit off...
Oh really? Can I read this to you this then?
This quote says, "I was jolted backwards. Someone had grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me down. I almost knell fell to the ground but was able..".
Yanked you down. Did you see it? Did she almost fall to the ground, Anderson?
You've suggested you might --
Excuse me, excuse me! I didn't suggest.
Oh, yeah, you did.
I tweeted. No, no, I tweeted.
A tweet is a suggestion.
Should I press charges?
Do you think this is politically motivated?
It could be. I don't know. Look, I'll tell you what: a friend of mine who's in law enforcement said to me, there's probably not a detective in the world that would have done what they did to him. I mean, people in Syria --
I did. In fact, there's the video right there.
Did you see the sign the protester was holding?
No I didn't.
Did you see what was on that sign?
But should your campaign manager be laying hands on anybody?
Excuse me. Did you see the protester grabbing the woman in front of him? With his hands on her neck?
No.
OK. Take a look. You know what he did? He had his shirt with two fingers like this, and then he let go because security was behind him, and they took off.
I want to ask you about another tweet you sent. You sent a tweet over the weekend about the death toll in this horrible terror attack in Pakistan over the weekend.
Right.
You talked about the death toll. And then you said, I alone can solve. What do you mean by that?
I think I alone because I know my competition. Look, I know my competition.
You, alone, among the Republican candidates.
I see Hillary with Benghazi, you know the famous ad, 3:00 in the morning, guess what, the phone rang, she wasn't there. Unless Sidney called, if Sidney called she was there.
But you're the only one who can solve terror problems in Pakistan? I mean, Pakistan...
Yes, of the ones that are running, I'm the only one. I know what I'm running. I know the competition. And believe me, I know, I watched Ted Cruz.
Let's talk about nuclear issues because you talked about this in a really interesting article in The New York Times.
One of the very, very big issues. I think maybe the biggest issue of our time.
That's what you said to The New York Times. You said you worried about the proliferation of nuclear weapons...
Right.
It has been a U.S. policy for decades to prevent Japan from getting a nuclear weapon.
That might be policy, but maybe...
South Korea as well.
Can I be honest are you? Maybe it's going to have to be time to change, because so many people, you have Pakistan has it, you have China has it. You have so many other countries are now having it...
But that's proliferation.
Excuse me, one of the dumbest I've ever seen signed ever, ever, ever by anybody, Iran is going to have it within 10 years. Iran is going to have it. I thought it was a very good interview in The New York Times.
... nuclear weapons.
At some point we have to say, you know what, we're better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea, we're better off, frankly, if South Korea is going to start to protect itself, we have...
Saudi Arabia, nuclear weapons?
Saudi Arabia, absolutely.
So you have no security concerns...
We're using all of the money...
... about Japan or South Korea getting nuclear weapons?
Anderson, when you see all of the money that our country is spending on military, we're not spending it for ourselves; we're protecting all of these nations all over the world. We can't afford to do it anymore.
Come on.
I thought it was fine. She's a pretty woman.
You're running for president of the United States.
Excuse me, I didn't start it. I didn't start it.
But, sir, with all due respect, that's the argument of 5-year-old.
No, it's not.
The argument of a 5-year-old is he started it.
You would say that. That's the problem with our country.
He didn't send out a picture. It was an anti-Trump super PAC sent out.
Anderson, it was a cover story of a picture taken by Antoine Verglas, one of the great photographers of the world, by the way. My wife was a very, very successful model, like one of the most.
It wasn't even a pro-Cruz super PAC; it was an anti-Trump super PAC.
Excuse me, they were Romney people. Romney is, you know, very embarrassed that he did so badly four years ago. The guy choked like a dog and lost an election...
Your wife is lovely, she's very intelligent. Heidi Cruz, I haven't interviewed her -- she seems like a very intelligent, very accomplished person as well. Can you just leave wives out of this?
Absolutely. I'd like to do it.
But why retweet -- why retweet somebody?
I would love to do it. I really would rather talk about nuclear proliferation. It's a slightly more important subject.
You act as if retweeting is not an endorsement.
Let me just tell you something, I would love to do it. I didn't send the photo to everybody in the state of Utah. He did. He knew about it. It was his people, who were his friends. It was a PAC that's...
Couldn't you just let it go, though? Do you have to retweet some random person sending you...
No, I don't let things go so easy. And let me tell you something. I don't let the -- if I were running the country, I wouldn't have people taking advantage of the United States in trade and in every other way, either. Believe me, I wouldn't have China walking away with trade deficits of $505 billion a year. I wouldn't have Mexico laughing at us how stupid we are with trade deals, and at the border. I wouldn't let Japan get away what they're doing with, you know, devaluation of the yen. China big league devaluation. No, I -- when somebody...
Can you say tonight, though, no more such about wives?
Oh, absolutely. I don't want to talk about that. It's ridiculous to be talking about that.
The other, though, part of Lieutenant Murphy's question was about protecting the rights of minority groups, of Muslims, or Sikhs, of Jews, and others inside the United States...
... I want to do that also, and I do want to do that, but I at the same time we have to recognize we have a serious problem.
... In your home city. Chief of Police under Giuliani, as well as now de Blasio, again -- out in L.A. He said about Ted Cruz's proposal, "we do not patrol and secure neighborhoods based on selective enforcement because of race or religion." Is he wrong?
I think we have to be extremely vigilant in those areas, we have to look very seriously at the Mosques. Lots of things happening in the Mosques, that's been proven. You look at what's going on in Paris where Mosques are being closed, OK? And, we have to look very, very seriously.
... Do you trust Muslims in America?
... Do I what?
Trust Muslims in America?
Many of them I do. Many of them I do, and some, I guess, we don't. Some, I guess, we don't. We have a problem, and we can try and be very politically correct and pretend we don't have a problem, but, Anderson, we have a major, major problem. This is, in a sense, this is a war...
I want you to meet Jeff Johns. He's a financial consultant. He said he is on the Trump train as of this point.
I like him. I like him very much.
I knew you would.
I like him.
Thank you for coming to the great city of Milwaukee.
Thank you, Jeff.
A lot of other candidates have released tax returns. You say you won't release them because you're being audited. There are some people who doubt you're even being audited or have been audited as much as...
Oh, I can give you a letter for that. Would you like a letter? I'll give you...
Can you?
I'll give it to you, sure, absolutely.
So you can offer evidence that you are being audited or have been audited like you say?
A hundred percent. I'll give you a letter from the biggest firm in Washington that does my work for me.
All right.
OK?
Good evening, Mr. Trump. In your opinion, what are the top three functions of the United States government?
Say it again?
Aren't you against the federal government's involvement in education? don't you want it to devolve to states?
I want it to go to state, yes. Absolutely. I want -- right now...
And federal health care run by the federal government?
Health care -- we need health care for our people. We need a good -- Obamacare is a disaster. It's proven to be...
You always say you're self-funding. How much do you think your campaign has cost -- in the past you said $25 million.
I can tell you, I'd say I'm in right now for -- now, I'm in for about $35 million right now.
OK.
We take the small loans, the people that send $17.50, or $250, even $1,000...
And you solicit those on your website.
No, I sell hats and shirts and...
No, but you do solicit donations on your website?
No, I don't really think so.
It's not peanuts; it's $7 million -- it's a lot of money.
I'll tell you what, what I've done is I'm in for about $35 million.
You've actually been loaning your campaign a lot of money. Are you going to have your campaign pay you back?
I doubt it. But it just seems to be the way it's done.
But that's a possibility?
I don't know -- can I be honest? I never even thought about it. I never even thought about it.
OK.
Just seems to me the way the lawyers set it up. But I am in right now, I put in my money, about $35 million. I think in terms of small donations, I think we've received $6 million up until this point.
I think I saw $7 million.
Excuse me. A lot of that is the selling of merchandise and things like that.
Mr. Trump, thank you so much for being here tonight.
Thank you.
Mr. Trump, in a recent interview with the Washington Post, you said that the U.S. should become a diminishing presence in NATO.
Absolutely.
Why do you think that the U.S. should start to withdraw their world presence from NATO, and what would you change about the organization so that we could remain involved?
OK, I did two basic and very large interviews recently. I did the New York Times, which treated me unbelievably fairly. And there was a front-page story on Sunday or -- I think, and It was a great story. And part of it was NATO -- and the other was the Washington Post.
I think you talked to them longer than any other candidate, by the way, on the Republican side.
I spoke to the Times?
You really think NATO is obsolete?
I think it's largely obsolete, yes. It's got to be changed. It's got to be -- you don't talk about terror. Our single biggest threat right now is terror, OK? Now that's an amorphous term, but it's terror. Our single biggest threat --
And for you that's --
It's possible --
Do you continue to pledge whoever the Republican nominee is?
No. I don't anymore.
You don't?
No, we'll see who it is.
... Just so I'm clear...
I don't want to make people uncomfortable. I don't need their support. Now, maybe it will be a negative, maybe it won't.
So, the pledge you took is null and void. The idea of supporting whoever...
... I have defeated...
Unfairly by?
I'll give you an example.
Who?
I think by, basically, the RNC, the Republican party, the establishment. You have a guy like Mitt Romney who lost miserably, who did a terrible job. He was a horrible, horrible campaign. The last month of that -- I helped him. I raised him a million dollars...
And, watching, and being involved in the process.
And, watching all of this. Your ratings tonight will be excellent, right? The debate you had where 23 million people, I don't want to say this tragedy, I'm just telling you, if I wasn't in it you would have had, what? Four million people...
... In the off chance that you're not the Republican nominee, what would go into your decision of whether or not you would support...
... Well, I'll look at it. I'll see who it is. I mean, I'm not looking to hurt anybody. I love the Republican party as...
In Louisiana, you won...
I won.
But Ted Cruz got...
To show you how corrupt the system is...
... got more delegates. You threatened to sue.
I won -- well, I'm going to see. I mean, I never heard of that before. You know, I'm a very -- I'm an American. If you win an election, you're supposed to...
But isn't that just sour grapes? Didn't he just have...
No.
But those are the rules. I mean, his campaign had a better ground game in Louisiana.
No, I don't know what rules -- OK, I don't know, I don't think -- I don't call it a ground game. I call it bad politics.
All right. I want you to meet Jim Zaiser, he's the CEO of a valve manufacturing company that has been in the family for three generations. He says he's undecided. He's leaning in your favor.
Thank you. That's what I like to hear.
I want to...
And by the way, you know who else evolved, is Ronald Reagan evolved. Because Ronald Reagan signed one of the toughest abortion laws in favor of abortion in California that had been signed in many, many years. And yet has a great president and a -- pretty conservative -- he wasn't very conservative, but he was a pretty conservative president.
You wouldn't debate him one on one?
I think we've had enough questions from the same people, including you -- and all due respect.
I haven't done a GOP debate yet, but that's all right.
How many times can the same people -- how many times, Anderson, can the same people ask the same question? It's just -- you get tired of it.
But as president you're going to be asked the same question for four or eight years.
I've had 11 or 12 debates -- wait a minute -- I've had 11 or 12 debates with Cruz. Every -- Drudge, they do an online poll right after the debate, Time magazine, Slate, many groups do -- I think I've won every single poll by a lot on debating. I have nothing to prove anymore.
I'm happy to keep having these conversations.
I don't think it's easier. I think debating is probably easier because you're talking so little.
Mr. Trump -- hi. Welcome to the Cheese State.
Thank you. A great state.
The question that I have -- Wisconsin is an amazing state. But our No. 1 economic driver, which is the dairy industry and the cheese industry is right behind it, is being challenged right now by having a labor force dependent on an immigration policy. And we've got over 10,000 farms in this state. And with there being such a strong economic driver, if we don't have a strong immigration policy that will give us the opportunity to keep the ones that we have and provide a vehicle to bring new ones in from Mexico legally...
Legally. You said the word.
We have time for one more question from the audience. This is Andy Bowen, she's from Shorewood, and homeschools her two daughters. She says she's leaning in your favor for the primary next week. Andy, welcome.
Thank you. Hi, Andy.
Thank you, hi, Mr. Trump. My 93-year-old father is so impressed with all of your kids.
That's good.
You just welcomed a new grandson...
... And I really appreciate your statement. Thank you.
You just welcomed a new grandson...
I did.
And here now with reaction, 2016 Republican presidential front- runner candidate Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, welcome back. Good to see you.
Hello, Sean.
First, congratulations are in order. I understand now you're a grandfather for, what, the eighth time?
That's right, number eight. And Ivanka had a beautiful baby, and we're very happy about it. I guess that's probably why I'm doing all of this. It's make America great again. I'm making it great for my grandchildren because, ultimately, that's what it's all about. That's what we all live for, I think, in a certain way.
If the tape was what she said -- if the tape -- if you saw on the tape something different, would you have fired Corey?
Oh, if he threw her to the ground, I would have fired him immediately. Absolutely.
Yes.
And then, you know, people don't talk about the tape. On other shows, on FOX, they don't talk about the initial -- her initial statement. But her initial statement was exactly what you and I both said...
I looked at it...
I mean, what happened?
What do you make -- I had a big fight on this program -- I'm not sure if you saw it -- with Jorge Ramos over the issue. He acts like he's a big objective reporter. He's not objective. He's open borders. He supports legalization for people who didn't respect the laws and sovereignty. And then he tries claim he's an objective reporter. And it basically was over him taking words you have said out of context because you didn't say all Mexicans are rapists or all Mexicans are rapists...
That's right.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Well, do you regret releasing the video considering it got your guy in trouble and now he's -- you know, in jail?
He's not in...
But a campaign manager should not be putting their hands on reporters.
Well, she shouldn't...
Carl Rowe didn't do it. David Club didn't do. David Axelrod didn't do it. He should -- that's why you have secret service and that's why you have your own security, who are great.
You don't know if they didn't do it because I guarantee you they probably did stuff that was more physical than this, more physical. Because this is not even physical. Frankly, she shouldn't have her hands on me. OK? Nobody says that. But she shouldn't have her hands on me if you want to get technical..
Yes. Piers Morgan did say that. Pierce Morgan wrote an op-ed about that, and did say that. Just to defend Megyn Kelly though, that was a debate we did -- that was Ben Shapiro. That wasn't Megyn Kelly saying that. But let's move on. Let's talk about...
Well, it was her show and frankly you can have Megyn Kelly. Since it was her show.
She had a debate. It was the topics of the day.
Maybe she does a good job for you. She doesn't do a good job for me and let me tell you, if she wouldn't report on Donald Trump, her ratings would go down in half.
Well, that's not true.
All she does...
OK. Let's...
Oh, really? And how many times was I on her show? She ought to stop reporting on me all the time. If she wouldn't report on me, her ratings would go down in half.
Yep, congratulations.
... was won. So we won Missouri last night.
Courageous, but yet so young.
It was a very sad moment actually.
Right.
And that's my leverage. And these are people that are really -- they really like Donald Trump, they really like what I'm saying. And people -- we're going to make America great again, that's what it is.
Right.
And now, there is two left.
You're counting Jim Gilmore?
I'm counting Jim. Sort of counting, sort of counting.
OK, let me ask you about the steps you've got. Cleveland is going to be in July. If you could win there short of 1,230 -- if you get to 1,237, you've got it.
Right.
Yes.
We're way, way up in votes, way, way up -- if we're a little bit short, I think it's a very unfair process. Let me just explain...
Well, what's the jimmy? Six inches, two feet?
Well, let me just explain something. Well, let me explain. Normally, you talk about running, and you don't have 17 people.
Yes.
You probably saw the poll that just came out in New York, Emerson College, which is a -- you know, I'm up by --
Yes, but it's all about you're not getting the 1,237. They'll deny it to you.
Yes, I know, I know, I know. We just -- all you can do --
Because they don't like you, they don't want you to be the nominee.
Well, that's true. But then, they're going to lose and then you're going to have four Supreme Court justices that they're not going to like.
Right.
It doesn't matter. The endorsements don't mean very much. You know, I have great endorsements. I have some phenomenal endorsements.
Yes.
I have Senator Sessions, Jeff Sessions, endorse me, everybody thought he was going to endorse Cruz. He endorsed me because he knows I'm much better on security. I'm better on a lot of things.
Well, three-fifths of the American people in the latest poll we got at NBC say that you're right, if you have the most votes, you should be the nominee. I'm still trying to figure out what your alternative is if you don't get it. What do you do?
Look, look. I don't think I'd want to tell you as much as I respect you. You know, I did an interview with -- Chris, at the University of Pennsylvania many, many years ago. We had --
It's all true, and you were a celebrity even then.
I was a celebrity, yes.
Let's talk about something, the 800-pound gorilla.
I mean, we have to -- I do like your question on leverage. My leverage is the voters, Chris, just to end it. My leverage is the voters. I have millions more votes than anybody else.
Was Teddy Roosevelt right to walk?
I studied well. I think possibly he was, but boy, did that cause a problem.
Something to de-escalate the issue and show respect for her. Could you have done that more?
No, I don't think so. I think if she called up to apologize, I think you'd be in the exact same place, and people that have seen that tape are going, give me a break. You have to be kidding.
But there was contact.
What contact? I mean, there's contact every time --
Well, that's what this law says. It's unwanted touching, unwanted --
Hey, look. I'm walking with reporters -- I'm walking and she contacted me.
What do you make of the bruises on the picture?
I don't know who created those bruises. I really don't know. I mean, you know, two days later, she comes in and she said she had some bruises. I don't --
But this kind of argument just infuriates her and a lot of women because you're not showing belief in her credibility.
I just gave --
What's the right approach, though? If you -- if you accidentally bump into somebody, accidentally trip them, you say I'm sorry. Don't you show some apology and respect for the other person?
Yes, I think that's fine. I mean, I think that's fine.
Wouldn't that be appropriate here?
I'm not sure he didn't maybe even say it there. What he was doing is -- in my opinion just in watching the tape, because nobody even remembers the incident because it was so minor, it's not like the -- you --
Almost went down.
Nothing -- there was nothing there. She didn't even have -- if I give you a little shot on the arm, you're going to go "Oww!" I'm a strong guy. You're going to go, "Oh!" You're going to have some kind of a facial -- she didn't even have facial movement.
But she did say in real time that it hurt and she wanted to know who did it.
I don't know when was a real time? When did they record that? I don't know. When did they record that?
Well, you're really skeptical about her.
I'm a very skeptical person about her, yes.
And why don't you have any sympathy for her?
I don't think that -- look, for --
She's doing her job.
First of all, it was my tape. You know I was the one that did the tape.
I know it's -- that was your tape.
And I looked at that tape, and we have heads being cut off in -- all over the world, frankly, but we have people's heads being cut off in the Middle East, people's heads being cut off. We have people drowning in steel cages. Here's a woman -- and it didn't even look like there was physical touch, and that was almost like he was just blocking her away from me, and he's supposed to be a criminal for that?
Yes. But we're -- but Western society claims that we're better with women.
Look, nobody respects women more than I do, that I can tell you.
You don't respect her, though.
And nobody -- well, you know, she's somebody that -- yes, I would say I don't have great respect for her. I think for her to do what she did to this man over what he did is outrageous, is outrageous.
Well, she quit her job over it, she must believe in her story.
Did she quit or did she get fired?
Well, I don't know. Let me -- I think she quit. I think she quit.
OK. Well, you think -- you do? I think maybe the other way. You'll find that, we'll find out in court.
How do you think women react when they see this?
I think a lot of --
The numbers aren't good.
I think a lot of women would say give me a break. I don't -- I don't understand why. I mean, the numbers aren't good. The numbers were good. The numbers aren't as good with women as they were. But nobody respects women more than I do.
Let's talk about ISIS. It's the number one concern of a lot of people since last week.
Right.
How do you beat people -- now, when we fought the Germans or the Italians and, you know, the army puts their hands up at the end because they know it's hopeless.
Right.
How do you fight --
It's called uniforms.
And how do you fight people who wrap themselves in dynamite? They get up, brush their teeth in the morning, shave I suppose in some cases, they go off to the airport with the idea of blowing themselves up, killing themselves that day, that morning. How do you beat an army like that, because this gets down to something that we haven't dealt with before in our history? How do we beat that kind of mentality?
We have to be so tough and so vigilant, and we have to do things, frankly, that we've never done before.
But they want to die for their cause.
Maybe they do, and some of them do. And I -- you know, a lot of people are trying to figure out why they do this, how they do this.
They're recruited.
Are they drugged out? Tell me.
They were here -- they were -- so what do you with -- OK. OK.
-- and they became radicalized.
How does that encourage them to fight the bad guys?
OK, let me -- they have a problem too. They have a big problem.
Are any Muslims telling you that?
I have actually -- believe it or not, I have a lot of friends that are Muslim and they call me.
Right.
In most cases, they're very rich Muslims, OK?
How do you let them in?
They'll come in. And you'll have exceptions.
Right.
-- many people saw that apartment with bombs all over the apartment.
Yes, I agree with that.
Bombs on table.
You see something, say something.
Not one person --
Look, look, you're saying ban --
In other words, why -- but Chris, why don't they report 'em?
OK.
I'm serious about that. Maybe they'll be --
What do you think of his stance? Patrol cars?
I think we have to look at the mosques. I think we have to be extremely careful. We have to look at mosques.
We're making enemies here.
A lot of things -- we're making enemies by doing nothing. I mean, we're knocking down World Trade Centers. We're shooting planes into the Pentagon.
Yes.
Probably the other plane was going towards the White House. You have some very brave people.
All right.
But, you know, what are we going to do, just sit back and say we want to be nice to everybody? We can't be so nice.
Yes, but sometimes we create more trouble than we went into. Do you think it was smart to go into Iraq?
A very complicated --
Was that smart to put our troops in the Holy Land of Mecca?
I thought it was one of the -- I thought it was one of the worst decisions in the history of our country. And I was against it from the beginning.
Are you more likely to engage militarily than Hillary?
Here's what I want to do: I would never want to make a blanket statement like that, because, you know, you have different -- I would have never gone into Iraq. And I said from a very early date -- and you saw that.
You need ground troops to do that.
First of all, Iran is getting the oil.
You need ground troops to take the oil.
I said, "Take the oil."
Ground troops --
Now, Libya -- well, I said, "Keep the oil." We -- we already had the troops there. When we were leaving, I said, "Don't leave. Keep the oil."
Well, why would you -- why wouldn't you just say, "I don't want to talk about it. I don't want to talk about nuclear weapons. Presidents don't talk about use of nuclear weapons"?
The question was asked -- we were talking about NATO -- which, by the way, I say is obsolete and we pay a dis --
But you got hooked into something you shouldn't have talked about.
I don't think I -- well, someday, maybe.
When? Maybe?
Of course. If somebody --
No. To drop a nuclear weapon on a community of people that are --
No, no, but you can't say -- first of all, you don't want to say, "Take everything off the table... "
No, just nuclear.
-- because you'd be a bad negotiator if you do that.
Just nuclear.
Look, nuclear should be off the table. But would there be a time when it could be used, possibly, possibly?
Because of the old mutual assured destruction, which Reagan hated and tried to get rid of.
I was against Iraq. I'd be the last one to use the nuclear weapon.
So can you take it off the table now?
Because that's sort of like the end of the ball game.
Can you tell the Middle East we're not using a nuclear weapon on anybody?
I would never say that. I would never take any of my cards off the table.
How about Europe? We won't use it in Europe?
I -- I'm not going to take it off the table.
You might use it in Europe?
No, I don't think so. But I'm not taking...
Well, just say it. "I will never use a nuclear weapon in Europe."
I am not -- I am not taking cards off the table.
OK.
I'm not going to use nuclear, but I'm not taking any cards off the table.
Hi.
Hi.
Oh, are you for it?
I'm for it. I use it.
Why haven't these guys in your party pass it? Why would they ever pass something like that?
They don't want to -- well --
Yes.
But I'm using it on -- they're building the old post office on Pennsylvania Avenue.
Yeah. Good job.
That I'm building into, what will soon be a phenomenal hotel.
But isn't -- isn't the --
And I'm using eVerify, and I'm telling you, it works.
Well, why doesn't your party and you back that?
Well, I back it, and my party backs it.
No, they don't.
Many -- well, many people --
Ryan won't even bring it up on the floor.
Well, but many people in the party do that.
Ryan's not -- they're not trustworthy. They're not bringing it up. They talk a line about illegal immigration. They want to play these games.
Like I said, there are many people --
They like the cheap labor.
And there are many people --
The regular working guy doesn't want it, but the business guys, the corporate leaders want the cheap labor.
Chris, we need borders. We need -- we have a country, we have borders.
I'm with you.
People are walking across the border like --
I like your line, either we have a country or we don't, I'm with you.
That's it.
But the way to stop illegal immigration is to stop illegal hiring. It makes economic sense.
You can do that, you can do that. And I do that on every single job I have.
Good evening, Mr. Trump.
Hi.
Why do you go to China and you see the cranes on a Friday night, they're working, they're building.
Yes.
The countries we beat in World War II all have state of the art stuff, and we're back 70 years.
Right. And you know why? Because they are killing us with monetary devaluation, with currency devaluation.
No.
It's true. It's true.
Right. But can you stop it?
So, it's --
And they're paying -- they've got our paper.
And they have a -- and on top of that, we don't --
What are they going to do if they dump all of that paper on the world market tomorrow morning?
You know, we owe them right now $1.7 trillion.
Right. What if they don't --
But on top of --
Suppose they dump all those funds?
We're going to be just fine.
Oh, really? We're going --
You know what? No, no. We're going to be just fine. Look --
So, our number one creditor is going to dump us a debtor, and we're going to be just fine.
Chris, they're making -- we are going to be absolutely just fine, unless we continue with the program we have right now.
Yes.
Do you know, we have a high dollar. You take a look at what's happening in this country right now.
Right.
People aren't coming here, our high dollar -- which sounds good to people. Everyone says, oh, that's great. We have a strong dollar. We're getting killed worldwide.
OK.
Manufacturing and even -- you look at tourism and everything else coming into this country, it's not happening. We're getting absolutely outmaneuvered by devaluation.
But these existing deals we have with the Middle East, with Israel.
You don't need them, you don't need them.
These existing deals we have with the Middle East --
You don't need them. Do you think --
You don't need those deals?
Do you think we have to protect Saudi Arabia?
How about the Middle East?
We are spending so much money -- well, you know what, we're fracking, and with all of the things that are taking place --
Yes.
And with all of the oil that Canada has -- Canada has more than almost anybody.
Yes.
When you look at what we have, we aren't dependent on that anymore, and we very shortly --
I know.
And we're defending them and we're getting almost nothing.
But you act like you're the only one that can cut a deal, that nobody else would be able to cut a deal.
They don't cut deals like I cut deals, that I can tell you.
And you're willing walk on all these deals, because that's where you win in our deals? You walk.
You always have to be able to walk. You have to be able.
How do you walk from NATO, the Middle East, North Asia, China, all these relationships? Just drop them all?
Look, NATO is --
We have old deals we have to stick with.
-- is 68 years old.
Yes.
OK, you have countries that are getting a free ride. You have countries that benefit from NATO much more than we do. We don't benefit that much from NATO.
I just -- I think you can turn down new deals, but all these deals we've had for years like NATO and relationships with Japan. Japan doesn't want a nuclear weapon.
We defend -- of course, why should they? Well, we give them...
Do you want them to have a nuclear weapon?
Wait a minute. We -- before and I'll answer that question. But, we defend -- a lot of people don't even know this. We spend a fortune on defending Japan. We spend a fortune on defending Germany, right?
Yeah.
We spend a fortune on defending South Korea. Now, I order thousands of television sets, you know, they come from South Korea.
I know.
They make so much. They're making a fortune. They're a behemoth, so is Germany. Why we defend them?
Because it's in our interest.
Yeah. But, why aren't they reimbursing us? Why aren't they paying a good portion of the cost?
It's fine, it's a good argument if you can get it. But, if there are alternatives as we walk.
I'll get it.
If the alternative is we walk...
I'm the messenger. I'll get it.
OK.
Another message you...
No, you're going to do it because they like you or they fear we'll walk?
No. They're going to get it because it's in their best interest.
You went -- in Reuters, you said something that...
If we have to walk, we have to walk.
... South Korea and Japan maybe having to develop their own nuclear weapon capability.
No. What I said is I'll keep it the way it is, but they have to pay their fair share. Just the way you've said, South Korea is a behemoth, they make so much.
I know.
The ships of the world, the great ships of the world. You can't buy televisions anymore unless you go to south other than Sony which is in Japan.
Yeah. But, you know, the last time we pulled troops from the 38th parallel we had a problem to the Korean War. So I just want this, you shouldn't be pulling troops.
I'll tell you what, the Korean War. OK. So we compete with South Korea. I have buildings in South Korea.
Yeah.
I get along great with the people in South Korea.
OK.
Let me tell you, they can't believe they get away with what they get away with.
No, they get away with it because we owe them a couple trillion dollars.
No, they get away because our leaders don't know what they're doing.
OK. Let's go. I'm monopolizing here. Let's go, young lady.
Hello.
Hello. I am Tai Nini and I have a question on, what is your stance on women rights and their right to choose and their own reproductive health.
OK. Well, look, I mean, I'm, as you know, I'm pro-life. I think you know that. And I -- with exceptions, with the three exceptions. But pretty much that's my stance. Is that OK? You understand?
What should the law be on abortion?
Well, I have been pro-life.
I know. I never understood the pro-life position. I never understood because I understand the principle, its human life when people see it. What crime is it?
Well, it's human life.
No, should the woman be punished for having abortion?
Look...
And this is not something you can dodge. If you say abortion is a crime or abortion is murder, you have to deal with it under the law. Should abortion be punished?
Well, people in certain parts of the Republican Party and conservative Republicans would say yes, they should be punished.
How about you?
I would say that it's a very serious problem and it's a problem that we have to decide on. It's very...
But, you're for banning it.
Well, wait. Are you going to say put them in jail? Is that...
Well, no. I'm asking you, because you say you want to ban it. What's that mean?
I would -- I am against. I am pro-life, yes.
What is then -- how do you ban abortion? How do you actually do it?
Well, you know, you'll go back to a position like they had where people will, perhaps, go to illegal places.
Yeah.
But you have to ban it.
You ban it and they go to somebody who flunked out of medical school.
Are you catholic?
Yes. So, I think...
And how do you feel about the Catholic Church's position?
Well, I accept the teaching authority of my church on moral issues.
I know, but do you know their position on abortion?
Yes, I do.
And do you concur with that position?
I concur with their moral position, but legally, to get to the question, here's my problem with it...
No, no, but let me ask you. But, what do you say about...
It's not funny.
... your church. Yeah, it's you and not the funny thing. What do you say about your church? They are very, very...
No. But, the churches make their moral judgments, but you running for president of the United States. You will be chief of executive of the United States. Do you believe in punishment for abortion, yes or no, as a principle?
The answer is that there has to be some form of punishment.
For the woman?
Yeah. It has to be some form.
10 years, what?
I don't know. That I don't know.
Why not?
I don't know.
You take positions on everything else.
I frankly -- I do take positions on everything else. It's a very complicated position.
But you say, one that you're pro-life meaning you want to ban it.
But, the Catholic Church is pro-life.
Don't talk about my religion.
No, I am talking about your religion. Your religion -- I mean, you say you're a very good catholic.
I didn't say very good, I said I'm a catholic. Secondly, I'm asking, you're running for president. I'm not. I'm asking you what should a woman face if she chooses to have an abortion.
No, no, I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to play that game.
Why not? Game?
You have...
You said you're pro-life.
You have -- I am pro-life.
That means banning abortion.
And so is the Catholic Church pro-life.
But then on control -- this isn't Spain. No control like in the church doesn't control the government.
What is the punishment under the Catholic Church? What is the punishment?
Let me give you something for the New Testament. "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." Don't ask me about my religion.
No, no...
I'm asking you, you want to be president of the United States.
You told me...
You tell me what the law should be. Just tell me what the law should be. You say you're pro life.
I am pro-life.
What's that mean?
With exceptions. I am pro-life. I have not determined what the punishment...
Why not?
Because I haven't determined it.
Well, when you decided to be pro-life you should have thought of it because....
No, you can ask anybody...
I don't believe in punishing anybody for having an abortion.
OK, fine. OK, that's fine.
Of course not and I think it's a women's choice.
So you're against the teachings of your church?
I believe -- I have -- as a view and a moral view, but I believe we live in a free country and I don't want to live in a country so fascistic. They can't stop a person for making that decision.
But, then you...
That would be so invasive. So determine of a society that I wouldn't be along with familiar with. And Donald Trump, you wouldn't be familiar with.
But you're speaking so highly about your religion and your church.
Yeah.
Your church is very, very strongly, as you know, pro-life.
I know.
What do you say to your church?
I say I accept your moral authority. In the United States the people make the decisions, the courts rule on what's in the constitution and we live by that. That's what I say.
Yeah. But, you don't live by it because you don't accept it. You can't accept it. You can't accept it. You can't accept it.
A fine? Imprisonment for a young woman who finds herself pregnant?
It will have to be determined.
What about the guy, who gets her pregnant, is he responsible under the law for these abortions or is he not responsible for an abortion decision?
It has different feelings, different people. I would say no.
Theodore, right?
Theodore James.
Speaking of being pro-life.
Right.
Mr. Trump, I'm Dana Shrome. And my question for is, could you provide us a little bit of your position on the right to marry for gays and lesbians as well as if you'll continue the fight for equality for those individuals?
Well, the courts have decided so that's really not a subject that's come up. But the courts have decided. I would have preferred states making the decision, but the courts have decided.
Just a quick furthermore, could you maybe talk about how you might increase equality for people of the transgender community?
I would say that I'm going to go by the laws of the courts and the courts said really is very much up in flux right now, but I'll go by the laws.
Next question. Go ahead.
Hi.
Yeah.
Yes?
My name is Elena Colt. And I'm a retired veteran.
Good.
I agree.
When you talk about illegal immigration, you're talking about they're being treated worse in many cases than illegal immigrants. And we haven't straight that out. We're going to straight it out fast. What's going on, it's corrupt, the veteran's administration and it's incompetently run. So I can tell you as a vet, you're going to be very, very happy with Trump.
Mr. Trump, welcome to Green Bay, and Chris.
Thank you.
Hello.
How are you?
Good. My name is Shana Frelick. I'm a professor here at the communication department.
Good.
Really? America is not great. It's not bad.
If you take a look -- look, our military has been depleted. Our vets are not being taking care of. I mean, we have a lot of problems. OK.
Why does everybody want to come here if we're not great? Everybody in the world wants to come here and everybody does better in this country than where they came from, everybody.
Other people have problems, too. Anyway with prison, I do think we can to a lot of privatizations and private prisons. It seems to work a lot better.
The loss of ambition.
Yeah.
No, I think is there.
There's a loss of something. So that book has not been written yet, but it's going to be written pretty soon. And I'm not hearing very positive things.
Hi.
Yes, hi.
My name is Michael Rector. My question is, so you're on the record saying that there might be riots in the event that you're not the Republican Party nominee.
No. By the way, I hope not.
No, I hope not, too. I mean, asking about that, in fact...
They won't be led by me, but will be a lot of unhappy people.
Yeah.
So it's really a very unfair standard. But, if I'm a little bit short, but I'm millions of votes and hundreds of delegates ahead of other people, I think you're going to have some very unhappy people. I hope nothing bad happens, but I think you're going to have some very, very angry and unhappy people.
What will you be?
I think...
What will you say to the American people who voted for you in that moment?
I can't say yet because that's a very emotional situation you're talking about.
But you said you...
I may.
You said you may use nuclear weapons, but you can't tell me how you're going to operate the convention?
No, I didn't say that. I never rule -- you don't want to from a negotiating standpoint...
Do you trust Mitt Romney not trying to go in there and grab it back?
No. I don't trust Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney was disgraced. He should have won that election.
You're good at this. But, I'm asking you...
No, no, I'm not good at it. I'm just telling you the facts.
Were you the guy who gave nicknames in high school?
No, but I give some nicknames, right now when I'm...
What do they think of this wall idea?
They like the wall and they like to be given their strength back. They want to be able to do their job. These are great people. These are people that can do their job, but they're not allowed to do it.
You're asking the Mexican government to put a wall up to keep its own people in.
No, no, no, no. We are putting the wall up.
They're going to pay for it. So they're going to pay for our wall to keep their people in their country. This can be like the Berlin wall. It's the only time to build a wall to keep your own people in. Why would any country pay to keep its on people in?
Let me tell you something.
It's never happened...
We have right now...
... except the Berlin wall.
We have a trade deficit with Mexico, $58 billion a year. The wall is going to cost approximately $10 billion. Believe me they will pay in one form or another.
If not, or else what?
You know what, they could stop a lot of the problem. You know, if you want to become a citizen of Mexico, you want to get into Mexico...
Yeah.
It is impossible.
I know. I'm not saying they're not hypocritical.
Let me just tell you...
I know that.
... they could stop a lot of the problems that we're having by themselves. They don't choose to do it. Not right. And we have a trade deficit, $58 billion...
So we cut off...
... they'll pay for the wall.
This is your strategy in every case. We can walk. No more trade.
You have...
No more trade with Mexico.
Oh, absolutely.
No more troops in Europe.
And by the way, when I say no more trade, once you -- once they know that you are really willing to go that extra length, there will always be trade, but we'll make good deals. We're making...
The bottom line is always we walk.
You have to be able to walk. Yes. It's unlikely that you'll have to, but you have to be able to...
These or else's could be very tricky. Anyway, thank you, Mr. Trump.
Thank you very much.
And the real first question is, where do you start the movie of your decision to run for president? Because that is a big deal. A lot of internal/external stuff, and we'd love to hear your monologue on how you did it.
Where do you start the movie? I think it's actually -- and very interesting question -- but I think the start was standing on top of the escalator at Trump Tower on June 16, which is the day -- Bob, you were there, and you know what I mean, because there has.... I mean, it looked like the Academy Awards. I talk about it. There were so many cameras. So many -- it was packed. The atrium of Trump Tower, which is a very big place, was packed. It literally looked like the Academy Awards. And....
But we want to go before that moment.
Before that? OK, because that was really....
Maybe late 2014 or before you started hiring people?
Well, but that was -- OK, but I will tell you, until the very end.... You know, I have a good life. I built a great company. It's been amazingly -- I'm sure you looked at the numbers. I have very little debt, tremendous assets. And great cash flows. I have a wonderful family. Ivanka just had a baby. Doing this is not the easiest thing in the world to do. People have -- many of my friends, very successful people, have said, "Why would you do this?"
So is there a linchpin moment, Mr. Trump, where it went from maybe to yes, I'm going to do this? And when was that?
Yeah. I would really say it was at the beginning of last year, like in January of last year. And there were a couple of times. One was, I was doing a lot of deals. I was looking at very seriously one time, not -- they say, oh, he looked at it for many -- I really, no. I made a speech at the end of the '80s in New Hampshire, but it was really a speech that was, it was not a political speech. But because it happened to be in New Hampshire....
And that guy was trying to draft you.
And he was a very nice guy. But he asked me. And he was so intent, and I made a speech. It was not a political speech, anyway, and I forgot about it.
And that was the real possibility? Or the first....
Well no, the real possibility was the Romney time, or the Romney term. This last one four years ago. I looked at that, really. I never looked at it seriously then. I was building my business, I was doing well. And I went up to New Hampshire, made a speech. And because it was in New Hampshire, it was sort of like, Trump is going to run. And since then people have said, Trump is going to run. I never was interested. I could almost say at all, gave it very little thought, other than the last time, where Romney was running. And I thought that Romney was a weak candidate. I thought that -- I thought Obama was very beatable. Very, very beatable. You know, you had a president who was not doing well, to put it nicely. And I looked at that very seriously. I had some difficulty because I was doing some big jobs that were finishing up, which I wanted to do. My children were younger. And four years makes a big difference. And I also had a signed contract to do The Apprentice  with NBC. Which in all fairness, you know, sounds like -- when you're talking about "president " it doesn't sound much, but when you have a two-hour show, prime time, every once a week on a major network....
So when did it go to yes?
So -- OK.
Because that's -- having made, you know, we all make minor decisions in our lives.
OK.
This is the big one.
Big decision. Yeah, this is a big decision. And I say, sometimes I'll say it in the speeches. It takes guts to run for president, especially if you're not a politician, you've never....
When did it become yes?
What happened is, during that time that I was just talking about, I started saying I'd like to do it, but I wasn't really in a position to do it. I was doing a lot of things, and I had a signed contract with NBC. But I started thinking about it. And the press started putting me in polls, and I was winning in the polls. In fact, the day before, I was on "Meet the Press " the day before I announced I wasn't going to do it, and I got signed for another two years of The Apprentice  and everything else. Which, by the way, I don't know if you saw, but The Apprentice  is a big thing. I made two hundred....
What happened between 2011 and 2014?
Well, that's what -- I mean.... Between 2011 and 2014? I would say, just thought process. Only thought process.
A lot of deals.
Yeah, I mean, I was doing -- but in terms of this, only thought process. So what happened, but during this period of time, I said, you know, this is something I really would like to do. I think I'd do it really well. Obviously the public seems to like me, because without any....
Who are you saying that to? Your wife?
To myself.
To your family?
To my family, but to myself.
To yourself.
Yeah, to myself, and....
This is interior dialogue.
This is thought process. And I'm saying to myself, you know, look, they put me in these polls. I'm number one. In fact, I said, I'm probably the only person ever to announce I'm not going to run for president when I'm number one in the polls. Because I remember the week that I announced that I wasn't going to run and that I was going to -- that basically NBC extended me for quite a period of time. And the week.... Oh, this is my son Don. Bob and Bob.
Can you isolate a moment when it kicked to yes?
Well, I'll tell you a moment.
Because that's what Bob and I are looking for.
I'll tell you a moment when it kicked to yes. Because it was a monetary moment also. So you saw that it made a lot of money because it was certified. Now it's much more, because I also have a big chunk of the show. We chose Arnold Schwarzenegger to take my place. OK? And hopefully Arnold will do well; who knows? But there was a moment in, I would say, February of last year, so that would be four months, three, four months before I announced, when Steve Burke, great guy, of Comcast -- the head -- came to see me with the top people at NBC. And they wanted to extend my contract. And I said, "Steve, I think that I am going to run for president. And if I do that, I'm not allowed to have a show." In fact, when I did "Saturday Night Live " recently, it was a whole big deal. I'm not allowed to be on, and they actually had to give certain periods of time to other candidates that were running. It was a whole big.... So. I disagree with the equal time provisions. I think they're very unfair. But nevertheless, you have them. So I said, "Steve, I can't have a show if I run. I can't be having a show, so I'm not going to run." He says, "No, no, no, you're going to do it." I said, "Steve, I'm going to." And they actually went to the upfronts and they announced that The Apprentice  -- in fact, you had a problem with it, because you were hearing that I was going to run, and then they announce that they're going to renew The Apprentice  with Donald Trump. And I remember he called one of my people, maybe Hope. But he called one of my people and said, "Wait a minute, he's going to run, but he just announced he's doing 'The Apprentice.' " Do you remember that problem?
Sure. I remember.
I didn't announce it. It was NBC, they so wanted the show to be renewed.
But what we've never fully understood is about.... Before that meeting with Burke, I've just never heard you talk about it in a vivid way. What was going through your mind about the country? With this moment in your life? That you said to yourself, "I'm going to tell Burke I'm going to run for president."
Well, OK. Sure. OK. Prior to that, I just felt there were so many things going wrong with the country. In particular, because I'm a very natural person when it comes to business, I assume -- I mean, I've done really well, and I do have an instinct for that -- and I felt that we were doing some of the worst trade deals ever. And then you look at what's going on in Iran with the beginning of negotiations of that disastrous deal. You know, look, it could've been a much better deal, Bob. They could've walked a couple of times. They could've doubled the sanctions for a couple of days and gotten the prisoners out early. They could've done so many things. To give the $150 billion back was terrible. So it was a terrible deal. It was a terrible negotiation. It was negotiated by people that are poor negotiators against great negotiators. Persians being great negotiators, OK? It's one of those things. You might be Persian. But the Iranians, frankly, are great negotiators. The deal was a disaster. But I would see so many things. And it would make me angry.
What made you angriest?
I would say in my case, more than anything else, the stupidity of the trade deals that we have with China, with Japan, with Mexico, with other.... Because that's something that I see. And I didn't know that it would hit such a chord, because it's hit a chord with a lot of....
Did anyone recommend no? Did your wife, or did your son?
Oh. Yeah.
Did anyone say, "Dad, Donald, don't do it?"
I think my wife would much have preferred that I didn't do it. She's a very private person. She was a very, very successful -- very, very successful model. She made a tremendous amount of money and had great success and dealt at the....
What'd she say?
She was, she said, we have such a great life. "Why do you want to do this?" She was....
And what'd you say?
I said, "I sort of have to do it, I think. I really have to do it." Because it's something I'd be -- I could do such a great job. I really wanted to give something back. I don't want to act overly generous, but I really wanted to give something back.
Well, that's the important moment, when you say, I have to do it.
Yeah, I had to.
That's the product of the endless internal dialogue.
Well, she's a very private person, and very smart person. I'm sure you've seen a couple of interviews that she's done. She's very smart. And there's no games. You know, it's boom, it's all business. But a very smart person. And considered one of the great beauties.
Did she give you the green light?
And she said, "Why are we doing the...." Oh, absolutely. She said, "If you want to do it, then you should do it, but...." And she actually said something that was very interesting. She's very observant. And she would go around with me. And look, I've been around for a long time at a high level. That's why you were up in my office in, I guess it was '89, I can't believe. So that might help you with your check. Check '89, '88. But I've been around a long time. She said, "You know if you run, you'll win." I said, "I don't know if I'm going to win." She said, "If you run, you'll win. But if you say you're going to run, they're never going to -- people are not going to believe it." Because people were let down the first time, I will tell you. They really wanted me to run, and I would've beaten Romney. They really -- they wanted me to run that time. So for the most part, the polls didn't include me. And then one poll included me, and I didn't do that well. I was down at like 3 percent. I said to my wife, "I don't think I can run. I'm down at 3 percent." Boy, that's a long way to go up. And she goes, "No, no, no, you're only at 3 percent because they don't believe you're running. If they thought you were going to run...." I said, "No, no, the poll said I'm going to run." She said, "No, no, they still don't believe it." It doesn't matter what the poll says. The poll can say, you are going to run, Donald Trump is going to absolutely run. It was very interesting. Sort of like -- I called her my pollster. She said, "No, no, they won't believe that. I don't care if they put it in, if they put it at the top of your building, 'I'm going to run.' They're not going to believe it unless that you go out and announce that you're going to run." And she said, "I hope you don't do it, but if you run, you'll win."
So it was an evolution. Let's turn to...
So it was an evolution.
Let's turn to the presidency. You're nearing the nomination....
And then the big thing, by the way, the big thing was standing at the top of that escalator, looking down into that room -- which was a sea of reporters, of which he was one, but a sea -- that was as big as anything we've had. And getting up and saying, all right. And I remember. I took a deep breath. I said, "Let's go, " to my wife. And you know, we came down. Pretty famous scene, the escalator scene. Boom. And we started, and we talked illegal immigration, and it became a very big subject, and that's where we started.
As you near the nomination and you look ahead to the possibility of being president of the United States, how do you conceptualize presidential power? And how do you see the job of president? This is something that's nearing, right now, for you.
OK. So first of all, I have to get there. Because I view it as a highly competitive process. I've been, it's very interesting, I've done very well up until now. I've taken out a lot of people. We had 17 people.
Other words, what's the definition of the job?
OK. I think more than anything else, it's the security of our nation. That's always going to be -- that's number one, two and three. After that, many things come into focus. It's health, it's health care. It's jobs. It's the economy. But number one -- and I say number one, two, three -- is the security of the country. The military, being strong, not letting bad things happen to our country from the outside. And I certainly think that that's always going to be my number one part of that definition.
Any.... Before coming over, Bob and I have had lots of chats. And we were thinking about this, that you are running for the nomination in the Republican Party.
Right.
Which is the party of Lincoln and the party of Nixon.... And so we have this party that you are running to be the nominee in, and it's got two heritages. Lincoln and Nixon.
That's true. That's true.
And why did Lincoln succeed? Thought about that at all?
Well, I think Lincoln succeeded for numerous reasons. He was a man who was of great intelligence, which most presidents would be. But he was a man of great intelligence, but he was also a man that did something that was a very vital thing to do at that time. Ten years before or 20 years before, what he was doing would never have even been thought possible. So he did something that was a very important thing to do, and especially at that time. And Nixon failed, I think to a certain extent, because of his personality. You know? It was just that personality. Very severe, very exclusive. In other words, people couldn't come in. And people didn't like him. I mean, people didn't like him.
And he broke the law.
And he broke the law, yeah. Yeah. He broke the law. Whether that's insecurity....
I mean, you listen to those tapes, and he's a criminal.
Yeah. Whether that's -- right. And he broke the law.
And time and time again, break in, get the FBI on this, get the IRS on.
Sure. Sure.
I mean, it is an appalling legacy of criminality.
Right.
And at the end, the day he resigned, an amazing day, he gives that speech which is kind of free association about mom and dad.
Right.
He's sweating. And then he said, "Always remember: Others may hate you, but those who hate you don't win unless you hate them, and then you destroy yourself." The piston was hate.
Well, and he was actually talking very much about himself, because ultimately, ultimately, that is what destroyed him. Hate is what destroyed him. And such an interesting figure. I mean, you would know that better than anybody. But such an interesting figure. And such a man of great talent. I mean, Nixon had great potential, great talent. Unfortunately it was a very sad legacy in the end. It turned out to be a very sad legacy. Such an interesting figure to study. I think....
Do you take any lessons from that? Because what did is he converted the presidency to an instrument of personal revenge.
Yeah.
You're my enemy, I'm going to get you. I'm going to get so-and-so on you.
Yeah. No, I don't. I don't see that. What I do see is -- what I am amazed at is, I'm somebody that gets along with people. And sometimes I'll notice, I'll be, I have the biggest crowds. Actually we've purposefully kept the crowds down this past week. You know, we've gone into small venues and we're turning away thousands and thousands of people, which I hate, but we didn't want to have the protest. You know, when you have a room of 2,000 people, you can pretty much keep it without the protesters. When you have 21 or 25,000 people coming in, people can start standing up and screaming. What has been amazing to me -- I'm a very inclusive person. I actually am somebody that gets along with people. And yet from a political standpoint, although I certainly have a lot of fans -- you just said hello to Senator Sessions. Cruz and everybody wanted Senator Sessions as much as they've wanted anybody, and he's a highly respected guy, great guy. And we have some -- and he endorsed me. We have some amazing endorsements, some amazing people, but I'm amazed at the level of animosity toward me by some people. I'm amazed.
But you're going to have to overcome that, Mr. Trump, if you're going to be the nominee and the president.
I think you may be right. I think you may be right.
I think this is such a pivot moment for you.
OK.
You're nearing the nomination. The presidency is possible. How do you -- you say you get along with all these people. How do you....
No, I say in my life I've gotten along with people.
Understood.
This is the first time where I've had this.
How do you expand your reach right now? How are you going to do this at this moment in the country, where there's all this anger that you're talking about? You think there's a lot of animus toward yourself. How do you expand your reach, your appeal, right now?
Well, let me tell you the biggest problem that I have. And I talk about it a lot. I get a very unfair press. I'm somebody that's a person that understands when I say -- when I say, I say what I say. But I really do get a very, very unfair press. And a lot of times I'll be making a speech, as an example, in front of a -- in Orlando, where you have 20, 25,000 people show up in the sun at 3 in the afternoon in an open venue. And I will be saying things, and Bob, it won't be reported what I say. It will be reported so differently.
So how do you -- so regardless of your view of the press, how do you navigate the....
Well, the problem with my view of the....
The candidate has to get beyond all these different obstacles.
No, you're right, but if the press would report what I say, I think I would go a long way to doing that. Now, there is a natural bias against me because I'm a businessperson, I'm not in the club. OK? You understand that. I'm not in the club. I'm not a senator, I'm not a politician. I'm not somebody that's been in Congress for 25 years, and I know everybody, I'm somebody -- I'm very much an outsider. I am also somebody that's self-funding my campaign, other than small contributions.
But the press likes outsiders. I mean....
But the press doesn't like me. For the most part.
And would you blame the problem on the press, on the media coverage?
No, I, but I think... I do say this: My media coverage is not honest. It really isn't. And I'm not saying that as a person with some kind of a complex. I'm just saying, I will be saying words that are written totally differently from what I've said. And I see it all -- in all fairness, the editorial board of The Washington Post. I was killed on that. I left the room, I thought it was fine.
But what are some concrete steps you could take right now to project a bigger presence, a more unifying presence? Regardless of your view of the press, which is noted. How do you take steps now to really become a nominee?
Well, I think -- it's a great question, and it's a question I've thought about a lot. I mean, I think the first thing I have to do is win. Winning solves a lot of problems. And I have two people left. We started off with 17 people. I have two people left. And one of the problems I have is that when I hit people, I hit them harder maybe than is necessary. And it's almost impossible to reel them back.... So (a famous athlete) calls me up about a month ago, right after I beat Rubio. And I beat him by 20 points. That was a big beating. Don't forget, he was the face of the Republican Party. He was the future of the Republican Party. So (he) called me up. And he said, "Hey Donald, could you do us all a favor? We love you. Don't kill everybody. Because you may need them on the way back." You know, you may need them when you go to phase 3, or whatever phase you're looking....
Because here's what -- what Bob Costa and I were talking about, and we appreciate this moment to really get into these things.
I just thought it was a great.... You know, especially....
No, no, exactly. Having done this, reporting, so many years -- too many decades -- that I've thought about, what's politics? All politics, all successful politics, is about coalition building.
It's true.
Do you agree?
I do. I agree. I agree.
And if you look....
But I think you have to break the egg initially. In other words, I agree with you, but when you're coming from where I'm coming from -- I came from the outside. By the way, I was establishment. I was an establishment guy until I said I'm running. And then when I said I don't want anyone's money, that drove everyone.... I mean, outside of the small contributions, you know, the stuff.... But -- because -- and even -- the reason for the small -- we get lots of little contributions. What does it amount to? Six, 7 million dollars? And we sell paraphernalia, we sell the Trump shirt and the Trump hat, little stuff. But it still amounted to like 6 million dollars, seven. But I'm in for about $35 million. But I don't want any money. Bob, I have turned down -- I would have made -- Bush had $148 million. I would've had five times that much if I wanted to take it.
But you said it: Sometimes you have to break an egg.
Sometimes you have to break an egg.
And haven't you broken enough eggs?
Well, if that's the question, I think I have two more left.
And.... OK, but at this point of -- as you -- Bob Costa, from his perspective of knowing the Republican Party... and the question is, how do you coalition-build, how do you unbreak those eggs?
So that's the question.
I was struck by your comments about Senator Cruz. It seems like you're not working as much as I would've thought to bring the party together.
I'm looking to win first. I really believe that once.... My life has been about victories. I've won a lot. I win a lot. I win -- when I do something, I win. And even in sports, I always won. I was always a good athlete. And I always won. In golf, I've won many club championships. Many, many club championships. And I have people that can play golf great, but they can't win under pressure. So I've always won.
But Bob's question is right at the heart of this. Because you said about Senator Cruz, I don't want his support.
Oh, is that what you're referring to?
Yeah. And he is, whatever you may think of him, and whatever battles you've had, he represents the Reagan conservative....
No, I don't think he represents Reagan.
That's how he's selling himself.
OK. Well, maybe now how he's selling himself.
That's perceived. And if you're going to be the nominee, you need the conservatives in the party.
Yeah. Well, but I also need the outside people, and I'm definitely now the outsider. Cruz is interesting. We got along very well.
Initially?
I would make provocative statements, and he would say, "I agree with Mr. Trump." I mean, he was above all. But I kept saying, "I wonder when he will attack." Because ultimately, assuming.... Because I've been at the center of the dais from day one. And even the other day, NBC came out with a poll, I'm at 48 to twenty-something. You know, that's a national poll. So what happened is he was, could not have been more supportive. And in fact, he made a speech, he was making a big speech in Washington, and he didn't have that many people going. And he called me and he said, "Would it be possible for you to come?" I made it outside of the capital, right in front of the capital, and I came and a tremendous number of people came and it was very successful. We shook hands and I left and that was that. But I got along with Cruz, Cruz, great. But I always said, Bob, and you were there, I said, at some point, this is going to end. Because people would say, you're the only two.
Right. And at some point the nomination battle ends.
Yeah. And at some point the nomination.
Maybe I'm mishearing you, but I feel like you're almost comfortable being the Lone Ranger.
I am. Because I understand life. And I understand how life works. I'm the Lone Ranger. And I said the other day -- I watched Cruz as he tried to be as politically correct as he could be. And they say, well, will you support? And I watched him during the debate, and he said yes, and Rubio said yes, and everybody said yes. Because that was the thing to do. We have to support the party. But I watched him struggling the other day, struggling so hard, to not use the word "no " when asked about will he support Donald Trump. At the same time, not wanting to -- wishing the question wasn't asked. Because he didn't want to do anything that would be offensive to the party, let's say, and to standard politics.
Can I just say for....
But Bob, what I told him...
Yes sir.
What I said is that, I watched that, and I said, look, he doesn't have to support me. It really doesn't matter. I don't want to make his life difficult.
But can you be president and be Lone Ranger?
Um....
I mean, as we were talking about Lincoln -- if we may.
Yeah.
Lincoln's second inaugural, he's won the war, he has broken more eggs than any president ever.
He broke a lot of eggs.
And he comes out and in his second inaugural he said, "Malice toward none, charity for all, bind up the nation's wounds."
Right.
Other words, he's saying, let's go back and coalition-build between the North and the South. Isn't that a moment you're going to have to face?
Totally, totally.
Or is that not right now, this moment?
I don't think it's now.
You don't?
No, because I think I have to win before I can do that. Look, I've had...
Might that not assist in the winning?
No, because you have two people that want to win also, and they're not going to be changing their ways.
Isn't that what people want to see now?
Yeah. Yeah, but they said... Yes.
In the Republican Party, I mean... there is a lot of angst and rage and distress.
A lot. Record-setting.
Record-setting.
I bring...
And you have to tame that rage, don't you?
Yes, yes, but I bring that out in people. I do. I'm not saying that's an asset or a liability, but I do bring that out.
You bring what out?
I bring rage out. I do bring rage out. I always have. I think it was.... I don't know if that's an asset or a liability, but whatever it is, I do. I also bring great unity out, ultimately. I've had many occasions like this, where people have hated me more than any human being they've ever met. And after it's all over, they end up being my friends. And I see that happening here. But when my wife and Ivanka and the rest of my family, for the most part -- Tiffany, my daughter, she's a very smart young woman, she's up at University of Pennsylvania doing great -- and she said to me the same thing.
Be presidential?
Be presidential. Now....
When did they start saying this to you?
Well, they really started saying it before the last debate. The last debate. And if you noticed, my attitude was much different in the last debate, OK? But I said, wait a minute. According to every single -- you know, Drudge, and all of the polls, they do these online -- they have polls for everything. They do debate polls. And you know what I'm talking about.
Sure.
Hundreds of thousands of people vote. I won every single debate. Every single debate. And I was rough and I was nasty. And I was treated nastily by the other side too. And then Rubio went, you know, Rubio went Don Rickles on me, and all of a sudden he became cute and he started getting extremely nasty. And I had to get even nastier to him. Now, what happened -- and then started with the Little Marco. Come on, Little Marco. Little Marco over here said this and that. And he didn't want to -- he didn't stop that, he didn't stop that because he was told, oh, he should stop. He stopped that because I was outdoing him. But here's the thing.
We understand the history of this. We followed.
Right, but here's the thing.
So is it....
Wait.
Sure.
OK, so my family comes up. Don. My daughter Tiffany, who's a great kid. Ivanka. My wife. And we were together. They said, "Be presidential, Dad, be presidential." Last debate. I said, wait a minute. If I get hit, I'm going to hit back. That's not going to look very presidential, because I hit back and you hit back. I said, I'm going to give it a shot. And I was actually -- you know, the last debate was actually a much different debate....
Right.
In terms of my tone. And I actually got my highest ratings on that debate.
But I'm just struck by -- we're asking the questions about being presidential. So many other people have asked, can Trump pivot, can he shift to a different kind of tone? And correct me if I'm wrong, but my view, listening to you, is you actually don't really have that much interest in changing too much.
Not yet. Not yet.
But it seems your natural inclination is to fight....
No.
No?
My -- yes, always to fight. My natural inclination is to win. And after I win, I will be so presidential that you won't even recognize me. You'll be falling asleep, you'll be so bored.
Really. But when Ted Cruz said what he said, and then you said, I don't need his support.
I don't need his support. I don't believe I need it.
Now, what would your family say to you?
Well, what I said is, I don't need his....
What would a president say? What would Reagan say? What would Lincoln say if the opposition came and said whatever they said, and then you said....
Well Bob....
Hey, look, we are going to bind up....
Yeah.
You think maybe you do need Cruz's support? Maybe you do need it at some point.
I don't think -- I have the people's support. I have a tremendous group. And by the way, let me just, before we get off that one -- because you were saying about Cruz -- it wasn't like he embraced me.
No, he didn't.
It wasn't like he said, oh, I will endorse Donald Trump. He is so wonderful, and if I don't make it he is somebody that I think would be fantastic. Well, he didn't exactly say that, Bob. He said.... He was pained having to answer the question.
Right.
So it wasn't like I'm saying, I don't want his support, as he says great things about me. So I had no guilt whatsoever saying it. I do believe it.
Do you think you're going to be at a point where you're going to have to call him and say, "Ted, I need you?"
I'll never have to call him. I may be at a point where I call him, but I never will....
And what would you say? If you won the nomination, would you call him and say....
I would call him to say congratulations on a great job. Because out of 17 people, you beat 16. OK? Which is pretty good, to put it mildly. You know, we had a lot of talent. When I first ran, and this is where I had some doubts, because what do I know? I didn't know most of these people. Although I'd been very political. I'd given a lot of money. I gave $350,000 last year to the Republican Governors Association. I was a member of the establishment, if you think about it, and very high standing because of....
Could you say to Ted Cruz, "Ted, the coalition-building is going to begin right now. I need your support and help and advice?"
I don't think I'd say it that way, but I would be able....
How would you say it?
... to get along with some of the people that I was competing against. Now, I will say this: Some of the people that I was competing against, I'm not sure they can ever go back to me. I was very rough on Jeb. I was told when I first started that Jeb was the preemptive favorite. He was going to....
Right. But you don't have a strategy for these "Never Trump " people? You would think if you're the nominee, you would have to find a way to bring Bush into the fold, to bring a Rubio into the fold.
I don't think -- look....
Do you have a strategy for that at all?
I think that's overrated, what you're saying, about bringing them into the fold. At the same time, I think I would be successful with many of them. I don't know that I'll be successful with Jeb Bush.
How about Cruz? What would you say to him, Donald?
I think I would....
Because this is really -- I think this....
Yeah, I understand.
We get pivot points, and we're going from a phase of....
I think Cruz and I could get along very well. I actually think so. We got along very well for six months.
Would you say, "I need your support?"
We got along very well for six months when I was attacking everybody.
Right. But now you're going to have to reach out to him, aren't you, if this is going to work?
Well, we'll have to see what happens. I don't think now, Bob, because he wants to win and I want to win. And I guess Kasich wants to win, although Kasich's only won one out of 28, right? That's not so good.
Our big picture is how Reagan in 1980 competed against George H. W. Bush in the primary, then put him on the ticket.
Yeah, and got along. And truly disliked each other.
And put him on the ticket.
Yeah.
Considers him to be part of the team, team of rivals. Could you have a team of rivals in a general election?
I would never want to say that now. Right now, I just want to win. And I don't want to say who's going to be -- as an example, people are saying, you should pick so-and-so as vice president. It's just too early for that. In my opinion, it's too....
You have a few names on your mind about VP?
I do. I do have names.
Can you share one or two?
I'd rather not do it now.
But Dr. Carson's come to the campaign, and Chris Christie's come to the campaign, and they were rivals in the past. And they said there was one person who we believe is going to make the country great again.
Very good point.
And look, nobody hit Dr. Carson harder than Mr. Trump did. It was very fair, and he made a very impressive speech in Iowa.
The only thing I did with Dr. Carson -- because I respect him a lot -- but I just talked about his book. Because he wrote things in his book, and all I did was quote from his book. Because, you know, it was tough stuff what he wrote about himself. He wrote about himself. It's an amazing story. And he....
Without names....
... understands that.
... as vice president, what would be the role and responsibilities of your vice president, should you be elected, should you win the nomination?
Well, the number one role is to be a great president if something should happen. OK? That's always got to be the number one role for a vice president. After that, I would say, frankly, somebody that can help you get elected. And then thirdly, somebody that helps you with the Senate and with the House. So it would be a political person. In other words, I don't need to have another great businessman come in and -- I don't need that. What I do....
Somebody who knows dreaded Washington, perhaps.
Somebody that can walk into the Senate and who's been friendly with these guys for 25 years, and people for 25 years. And can get things done. So I would 95 percent see myself picking a political person as opposed to somebody from the outside.
And would that person be integral to the governing team you would have in the White House? Go to all meetings, have total access?
Yes, I would.... Sure. Sure. This would be a vice president -- I would like to have somebody.... For instance, somebody like Ben Carson. When Ben Carson came to me -- not necessarily vice president -- but when he came to me, he called, he said, "What you're doing is amazing. It's a movement. And you see that." When I announce I'm going to go to Tampa three days before, and we go there three days later, there's 25,000 people in the stadium that houses the professional sports teams....
No, it says a lot that -- you are acknowledging that you don't want to have another outsider as part of your team.
Yeah.
You need an insider.
Somebody like Ben Carson, he never once said to me, could I have a position?
So, sticking on this presidency theme for a second, I don't think a lot of people know that much about how much you value discretion, loyalty within your business.
Great loyalty, yes. Great discretion, great loyalty.
But it's different when you're running the federal government.
Well, it's....
And one thing I always wondered, are you going to make employees of the federal government sign nondisclosure agreements?
I think they should. You know, when somebody -- and I see it all the time.... And I don't know, there could be some kind of a law that you can't do this. But when people are chosen by a man to go into government at high levels and then they leave government and they write a book about a man and say a lot of things that were really guarded and personal, I don't like that. I mean, I'll be honest. And people would say, oh, that's terrible, you're taking away his right to free speech. Well, he's going in.... I would say... I do have nondisclosure deals. That's why you don't read that....
With everyone? Corey has one, Hope has one.
Corey has one, Hope has one. Did you sign one?
Stephen (Miller, Trump's policy adviser) has one.
Stephen has one.
Don has two.
I know, I forgot, he's the one I'm most worried about.
I'm not getting next week's paycheck until I sign one.
I have a very, very, very prominent businessman who's right now got a person -- he's involved in litigation, terrible litigation with somebody that worked for him in a very close level. And I said why are you....
Do you think these are airtight agreements?
Yeah, totally. I think they're very airtight. They're very....
And that no one could write a book or....
I think they're extremely airtight. And anybody that violated it -- let's put it this way: it's so airtight that I've never had... you know, I've never had a problem with this sort of thing.
Let us ask this....
By the way, this man called me, he said, how is it that you don't have -- as famous as you are? And I sent him a copy of the agreement. He said, this is genius. And he now has people that go to work for him. I don't like people that take your money and then say bad things about you. OK? You know, they take your....
But it's so different when you're in the federal government.
It's different, I agree. It's different.
But you are recommending nondisclosure...
And I tell you this, I will have to think about it. I will have to think about it. That's a different thing, that I'm running a private company and I'm paying people lots of money, and then they go out and...
The taxpayers are paying the other people in the federal government.
Sure. Sure. They don't do a great job, and then you fire them and they end up writing a book about you. So it's different. But I will say that in the federal government it's a different thing. So it's something I would think about. But you know, I do right now -- I have thousands and thousands of employees, many thousands, and every one of them has an agreement, has a... I call it a confidentiality....
Say you're elected president. Would one four-year term be enough?
I would say the following: I have seen people make the statement for Senate and for other positions, government -- because I've been a very political person over the years, I've gotten as many zone changes as any human being on earth, probably, including the entire West Side of Manhattan from 77nd Street to 59th Street. A very successful job. I would say that every time I see somebody make that statement and then they're feeling good and doing a great job, and they run, they lose because of that statement. So I would never want to say that four years... I would never want to limit myself to four years. I think I can do a tremendous job in four years. One of your questions, I noticed, is what would be your first 90 days in terms -- and we'll talk about that next.
Good.
But, so I think I can do a terrific job. And I think this: if I'm doing a terrific job, and if I'm feeling well, I would say I would continue to go for the extra four years. Because again, I don't want to put that burden on myself. If I'm doing a good job, I should be allowed. And I only say that because you know, Bob, I've seen so many people say it. Even for local positions. And if they decide to then go, they always lose because they make that statement. So I don't want to say that. But I think I will be able to do a fantastic job in four years.
Real quickly, at the Post editorial board interview, you referred to the $19 trillion in debt, and then you said the U.S. is "probably sitting on a bubble."
Yeah, a bubble.
What bubble?
Well, I think we're sitting on an economic bubble. A financial bubble. I think if you look at the stock market...
In the stock market you mean?
Yeah.
Or do you mean....
Well first of all, we're not at five percent unemployment. We're at a number that's probably into the twenties if you look at the real number. That was a number that was devised, statistically devised to make politicians -- and in particular presidents -- look good. And I wouldn't be getting the kind of massive crowds that I'm getting if the number was a real number. People are extremely unhappy in this country.
And so is the bubble -- it's not a housing bubble.
No, no, I'm talking about....
Or a real estate building bubble.
I'm talking about a bubble where you go into a very massive recession. Hopefully not worse than that, but a very massive recession. Look, we have money that's so cheap right now. And if I want to borrow money, I can borrow all the money I want. But I'm rich. If a person that wants to put a lot of people to.... And I don't need the money. I don't have to borrow. I don't even call banks anymore. I use my own money to do things. If I want to borrow money or if another rich person wants to borrow money, you can borrow money at, like, LIBOR plus nothing. And you're paying one and a half percent interest, it's crazy, and they'll give you all you want. If somebody is a great, wonderful person, going to employ lots of people, a really talented businessperson, wants to borrow money but they're not rich? They have no chance.
Bubbles are scary to economists.
Oh, bubbles are scary.
Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Fed, used to say, there may be a bubble out there but you don't know it's a bubble until it bursts. Is that true?
Yeah. That's true. I think that's true. I think you had a lot of signs, because you had all those exploding mortgages. I told....
And you say there are signs now.
... people.
We're "sitting on a bubble."
OK, so I made many speeches for different groups on success, where people would pay me a lot of money, I gave it to charity. People would pay me money for speeches on success. So I would do that, before this. And I would tell people, don't invest that, don't go -- I was pretty good at prognostication, at telling people what to do in terms of.... Now, I'd talk about success, but I'd say, this is a bad time to invest. I also said, this is a good time to invest.
What is it now? Is it a good time to invest now?
Oh, I think it's a terrible time right now.
You really do?
Yeah.
Why is that?
Because the dollar is so strong. Our country is in -- you know, it's very interesting. There's a couple of things good about strong dollars, but there's some...
So your tip, stock tip, is to get out of the market? Or avoid it now?
Oh, my stock tip is that the market -- I believe we're sitting on a big bubble. So you take a look at what's going on. You have -- think of it -- you have cheap money that nobody can get unless you're rich. You have the regulators are running the banks. Not the guys that are being paid $50 million a year to run the banks. I mean, when you look at many of your friends that are running banks that are being paid $40 and $50 million, yeah, they're not running the banks. The regulators are running the banks. You have a situation where you have an inflated stock market. It started to deflate, but then it went back up again. Usually that's a bad sign. That's a sign of things to come. And yeah, I think we're sitting on a very, very big bubble.
So the Wall Street people are going to -- when we publish this -- are not going to like to hear the possible president say....
Yeah, I don't care about the.... I know the Wall Street people. I know the Wall Street people probably better than anybody knows them. You know, the Wall Street....
You don't need them either?
No. No. You know, I don't need them. No, other candidates need them, by the way. Ted Cruz needs them. Ted Cruz borrowed millions of dollars for his (political-action committees).
But doesn't this go back to the coalition? I'm sorry.
And by the way, and didn't disclose on his personal financials that he was borrowing money from Goldman Sachs and Citibank and didn't -- and paying almost no interest. He had an interest rate that you would've been proud to have, and he didn't disclose it. Which nobody made a big deal out of. You did a little bit. But no I do, I think we're sitting -- it's precarious times. Part of the reason it's precarious is because we are being ripped so badly by other countries. We are being ripped so badly by China. It just never ends. Nobody's ever going to stop it. And the reason they're not going to stop it is one of two. They're either living in a world of the make believe, or they're totally controlled by their lobbyists and their special interests. Meaning people that want it to continue. Because what China, what Mexico, what Japan -- I don't want to name too many countries, because I actually do business in a lot of these countries -- but what these countries are doing to us is unbelievable. They are draining our jobs. They are draining our money. They are taking the money out....
So you are really pessimistic, to say the least?
I'm pessimistic. Unless changes are made. Changes could be made.
Could you fix it? Next year, if you became president?
Yes, I can fix it. I can fix it pretty quickly.
OK. Tell us that.
When I was at your editorial board meeting, I talked about NATO. And I'm not a world expert on NATO. But I have a natural instinct for certain things, OK? Like I said, keep the oil. Well, now ISIS has the oil. I said a lot of things. I said in my book about -- written in 2000 -- mentioned Bin Laden in a paragraph or two. And that was two years before the World Trade Center came down. And I'm not a politician, I was....
So what's your instinct, your plan, for let's say first 100 days, how you turn this all around?
OK, well, I say this. Look: We are making, and we have, some of the worst trade deals in the history of trade. We're now making one, Transpacific Partnership. TPP. A disaster, that deal is a disaster.
You know lots of experts, supposedly, disagree with you on the trade issues and so forth. Feel....
Yeah. Oh, I was against NAFTA.
And there's a lot of analysis, and a lot of data.
I was against NAFTA. NAFTA's been a disaster. I mean, frankly, I'm a big Ronald Reagan fan, but I disagreed with him on trade. I thought his trade policies were terrible.
So the first 100 days, what would you do?
OK. I would do a number of things. I would, number one, I would start negotiating great trade deals using -- I know the best people. You know....
You think that can turn around in 100 days?
No, no, it can't, no, but I would start the negotiation. No, these are complicated transactions. Part of the problem with the TPP is it's 12 countries. OK? And you should do individual country deals. It's 7,000 pages long. And each one of those countries has studied this thing, photographic. We have congressmen, they don't even read these agreements.
But this is a -- that would be driven out of the executive branch, that kind of negotiation.
Yeah. It's a bad deal. It's a bad deal for our country.
What about legislation? What about economic legislation?
Well, I know, but it's a bad deal for our country. What I would do -- and before I talk about legislation, because I think frankly this is more important -- number one, it's going to be a very big tax cut. Because the middle class has been.... And Larry Kudlow and numerous people have liked very much.... You know, I put in a plan for tax cuts, and I've gotten some very good reviews. I would do a tax cut. You have to do a tax cut. Because we're the highest-taxed nation in the world. But I would start -- because I noticed your question briefly -- boom, what would you do in the first 90 days? I would immediately start renegotiating our trade deals with Mexico, China, Japan and all of these countries that are just absolutely destroying us. And they have been for years. It's an incredible tribute to our country that we can lose billions -- hundreds of billions -- of dollars consistently, year in and year out -- and still even survive. We have rebuilt China. We have rebuilt it. I mean, you look at what's going on in China. We have rebuilt China single-handedly. Now, they've done OK with Europe too, but....
So renegotiate trade deals and have a tax cut. That would be your first 100 days?
Renegotiate trade deals and renegotiate military deals.
Real quick on trade deals...
And by the way, and renegotiate with NATO. And renegotiate with Japan and with...
On trade deals, dealing with a company, on your business deals, when you study them, it's dealing with people and corporations.
And I'm negotiating over 100 deals. We're negotiating 114 deals.
But aren't deals with countries and foreign leaders different than the kind of transactions you do at the corporate level? And how do you make that transition?
No.
Because you can't say to a country, I'm going to sue you.
No. Well, you know, it depends on what your definition of "sue " is. We will be able to make great trade deals. It'll be good for the counties, it will be good for us.
How long will it take? A year? Two years?
It will go.... Yeah, I would say within the first year a lot of it will be done.
Sir, in listening to this...
But you have to be able to walk. You have to be able to....
... and covering lots of presidents, if I may go back to that experience.
Go ahead.
Trying to understand them. Reagan was Morning in America. And it's almost like you're saying, at least for a while, morning in the ditch. That we are just not going to be able to get out because of these trade deals, because of your pessimism about the economy.
Look, we are losing $500 billion a year on trade deficits with China. OK? We've been for a long time, from 200 to 500. We are losing hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars a year on trade. You look at Japan. They send their cars in here by the hundreds of thousands. You go to Los Angeles, you look at those docks, and these cars get driven off those boats at 40 miles an hour. You've never seen anything like it. They just come pouring into our country. And yet when -- you talk about an imbalance, when it comes to us selling to Japan? They take very little.
Where's the optimism to get out of this?
Oh, I have great optimism.
You do?
Oh. Oh, OK. With all of that, I'm an optimistic person. You know, "Make America great again."...
I know, but it's a very important -- and it's respectful. I just -- we set it up, and....
Could you call them up and say could we delay half an hour?
I don't know. Let me find out.
OK. Because I'd like to finish with these guys.
Thank you. We appreciate it.
So just so you understand, mine is a message of great optimism. We can fix it.
But not everyone thinks that, right?
No, no. Not everybody thinks that. Some people don't understand that.
Meaning you. I asked her about you. What do you think of Trump?
Was she here...
And she said, "All I want is my dignity."
Yeah. I'll give her great dignity. Let me hear the question -- you may not know the answer.
What do you have to say to her?
Was she here legally or illegally?
I asked her, and she would not say.
That means she was here illegally. OK. So here....
Possibly. And she says... Trump, I asked her, I said, what do you think of Mr. Trump? And she said, "He doesn't like me." She took it personally. And then she said, "I just want my dignity."
I understand that.
What would you say to her?
I'll tell you what I'd say to her. Number one, she was probably here illegally. The polls are all showing people -- Hispanics -- that are here legally like me very much. In Nevada, you saw the poll, I'm leading with the Hispanics. People that vote, people that therefore are here. I'm leading with Hispanics. People that are here illegally maybe feel differently and they do feel differently, but people that are here legally, Hispanics that are here, they don't want their jobs taken. And they know I'll bring jobs back from China. I'll bring jobs back from Japan and from Mexico and from all these countries. You look at what Mexico's doing, Bob. Mexico is the new China, smaller level. Mexico, what they're doing to us on trade and at the border is unbelievable. OK? And I was right. When I got up and made that initial speech in Trump Tower on June 16, and I talked about illegal immigration and the problems, that hit a nerve. You know? Because....
It's not all economic. Because some of these people we encounter on the campaign trail, whether it's an undocumented Mexican maid or it's a Muslim, one consequence of your campaign has been they feel isolated in America. And you may disagree with the reason they feel that, but that is how they feel as a consequence of your message. How do you speak to those people who think you don't want them in this country? Including Muslims.
I am a person that's going to bring this country together. I'm a person that's going to unify the country. President Obama is a divider. He is not a unifier. When he first got elected, I didn't have great feelings for the fact that he was going to do well. But the one thing I thought, he would be able to unify the country. African American, white, I thought that he would be a unifying factor. He has not been. He's been a great....
But Bob Costa's right, Mr. Trump, that you talk to people and they feel you're not a unifier.
I know. They feel that now.
And you say you are. The question becomes... I mean, this is one maid, but I think there are a countless number of people out there who, in essence maybe they could not put it in this articulate way, they want their dignity, and the question is, how are they going to get it from you if you're president?
Well again, so I asked you the very important question, was she here legally or illegally?
I don't know.
Because if she was here legally, I think you would find that she would like me very much. In Nevada, where you have a huge Hispanic population, when they did the exit polls, I won with the people that are Hispanic in the state of Nevada. But not by a little bit, by a lot. I think that's a -- it's an important question to ask. I will give people back their dignity because I'm going to bring jobs back. Our jobs are being taken away from us like candy from a baby. Our jobs are being ripped out of our country. Carrier announced -- I talked about it the last month, because I thought that was in particular bad. Maybe because I buy a lot of Carrier air conditioners. But....
But this maid doesn't have a lawyer, I suspect. And she came to the country, we don't know. And she didn't do anything that put her in the position she may be in, you're right. And what she's saying is -- and I was floored by what she said, quite frankly. "I just want my dignity."
Yeah. Well.
And a giant question, pulsing out there, is how do people get their dignity that you seem to be quite critical of? Illegal immigrants....
No. I'm....
Well, you are critical.
Well, illegal immigrants, yeah. Just so you understand, I want people to come into this country. I want to make it much easier to come into the country. But they have to come in through a legal process. Were you able to do that, Corey? Huh?
Yeah.
We have a meeting with -- sort of an important meeting.
Yeah, the foreign policy people.
Well actually we already met with them. We just....
I understand that. And you know, these are such serious questions, and you are answering them with -- you're being straight about it. I appreciate that.
Here's what -- I think I'll do really great. With the African Americans. And a lot of people think that. And you know that a lot of people think that. But I think I'm going to do great with the African Americans. I think I'm going to do great with Hispanics. I'm going to bring jobs back to the country. I'm not going to let people take our jobs. I'm not going to let people go -- I'm not going to let factories and Nabisco and all of these companies -- Ford -- we're going to build here. We're going to keep the jobs in our country. And we're going to bring jobs back to our country, Bob. And that's going to....
Understand. Let me ask, this is a really....
Jobs is a very big answer, because that's going to give....
Of course. Although this maid has a job.
That's right. But dignity. And maybe she'll have a better job. She'll have more options.
OK. What would be the most challenging situation that, say you're president, or the next president, might face? And this is a serious issue. I asked President Obama this a number of years ago. And he said, what I worry about most -- sitting in the Oval Office, and I think he really meant this -- I worry the most about a nuclear weapon going off in an American city.
OK.
That is the game-changer.
It's funny, it's very interesting. I'm surprised he said that, because I heard him recently say that the biggest problem we have is global warming, which I totally disagree with. OK?
But he told me....
OK.
Sat there. And I thought, you can read between -- do you agree with that?
It's very interesting. I have... I absolutely agree. I think the single greatest problem that the world has -- we have an ISIS problem, and we have -- but the single greatest problem that this world has is a nuclear, the power of nuclear. The tremendous power. You look at Hiroshima and multiply it times a thousand.
And he's, President Obama's having this summit now, right here in Washington, down the street. And he is a strong advocate for eliminating nuclear weapons entirely.
OK.
Would you agree with that?
Well, if it's done on equal basis, absolutely.
You would.
But the problem you have now.... Done on an equal basis. The problem you have now is you have Pakistan. And you just see what happened in Pakistan. It's not like, you know, that's a perfect situation. You have India. You have so many countries now with nuclear already. You have some very bad people trying very hard to get nuclear. So I think that's something that in an ideal world is wonderful, but I think it's not going to happen very easily.
Would you pick up the baton on that effort on his part?
I would love to see a nuclear-free world. Will that happen? Chances are extremely small that will happen. Look, Russia right now is spending a tremendous amount of money on re-doing their entire nuclear arsenal.
When you look at foreign policy....
By the way, I love that. But from a practical standpoint, not going to happen.
Did you read Jeffrey Goldberg's article about Obama's foreign policy? In the Atlantic, Obama gave....
In the Atlantic, OK.
So one of the quotes Obama said in there is, "The notion that Russia is somehow in a stronger position now in Syria and Ukraine than they were before they invaded Ukraine or before he had to deploy military forces in Syria is to fundamentally misunderstand the nature of power in foreign affairs. Real power means you can get what you want without having to exert violence." That's Obama on global power. Do you agree?
Well, I think there's a certain truth to that. I think there's a certain truth to that. Real power is through respect. Real power is, I don't even want to use the word, fear. But you know, our military is very sadly depleted. You look at what's going on with respect to our military and it's depleted from all of the cuts. Hey, as a real estate person, all the time I'm getting listings of bases, Army bases, Marine bases, naval bases. I keep saying, how many bases do they have? I'm constantly getting, it's crossing my desk, do we want to buy a base in Virginia? Do we want to buy.... And I see it all the time. We have to strengthen our military. It's so vital to do that. We have to strengthen our military. By the way, we have to take care of our vets. So vital. But we have to strengthen our military. Now, one of the things that The Washington Post treated me very badly on, when I talked to you about NATO, we're spending too much money, and we're not getting treated with respect from the 28 countries that we're dealing with.
This comes back to the Lone Ranger point. I think even globally, you're comfortable being the United States president.
No.
Not being an interventionist....
I didn't say I'd get out of NATO. I say it's got to be.... First of all, it's obsolete. Our big threat today is terrorism. OK? And NATO's not really set up for terrorism. NATO is set up for the Soviet Union more than anything else. And now you don't have the Soviet Union.
Well, you don't have a great belief in these international institutions.
No, because we seem to get ripped off by everybody. We seem to always be the one that pays the bill and gets the least. And we're going to stop doing that.
But you're talking about reform of NATO, aren't you, rather than....
Yes, I'm talking about reform.
You're not just saying, let's move out.
I'm talking totally about reform. But you have to be -- in order to get reform, you have to be prepared to walk. Otherwise you can't get reform. For instance, the Iran deal. Had John Kerry stood up from his chair when they kept saying no, no, no, no -- he didn't get anything. Had he stood up twice -- once or twice -- from his chair and said, sorry gentlemen, we're leaving, and increased the sanctions, you would've had a whole different Iran deal.
OK. One really important question.
Go ahead.
A couple of years ago, I had a breakfast with one of the leaders, heads of state, of our best allies. And I asked him about Obama. And he was talking off the record, and he said, "I like him. He is smart. But no one in the world is afraid of him." Do you agree with that? And in a Trump administration -- are you formulating a new doctrine of you better be afraid of me?
Yeah, I don't want people to be afraid. I want them to respect our country. Right now, they don't respect our country.
But do they respect you if you kind of....
People have respected me. My life has been a life where I've been respected. I want them to respect our country. I want them to respect our leader. But I want them to respect our country. Now, you could use....
How do you achieve that, sir?
Through the aura of personality. Through having the goods. You know, so Muhammad Ali is a friend of mine. He's a good guy. I've watched many people over the years. Muhammad Ali would get in the ring and he'd talk and talk and scream and talk about the ugly bear, and this, that -- you know. And then he'd win. And respect is about winning. We don't win anymore. I see it in my -- we don't win anymore. And he'd win. I've seen many fighters that were better than Muhammad Ali, in terms of talking. I've seen guys that were so beautiful, so flamboyant, they'd get into the ring -- and then they'd get knocked out. And guess what? It's all gone. Let me just say: we don't win anymore.
So do you want Putin to be afraid of you?
I want Putin to respect our country, OK?
And what would he respect?
Well, first of all, it's sort of interesting. He said very good things about me.
Understand.
You saw that. He said, Trump is brilliant and Trump is going to be the new leader and all that. And some of these clowns said, you should repudiate Putin. I said, why would I repudiate him? He's not going to get anything. Because I've been through this stuff before. But he said very positive things about me. And I say to myself -- and I say to people -- wouldn't it be nice if we actually could get along with Russia? And if we could get along with these people? China takes advantage of us. Look at what they're doing in the South China Sea. They're not supposed to be playing that game. OK? Look at what they're doing. That is a lack of respect. When they're building a massive, like nobody's ever seen before -- they're building islands in the middle of the South China Sea for a massive military complex. Beyond runways. I mean, this is a complex. So what I'm saying is there's a tremendous lack of respect for our country. And I think for our leader.
But what does Putin respect? The former KGB lieutenant colonel? Force. Power.
I think he respects strength. OK? I think Putin respects strength. And I've said it before, I think I will get along well with Putin. Now you never know. I don't say that -- only a fool would say, "I will, " but I feel that I will get along well with Putin. I feel that if we can get along with more countries, that's a positive thing. That's not a bad thing. Some people -- for instance, when Putin came out and he wanted to bomb the hell out of ISIS, we had people standing on the stage, we don't want that, we want.... Let me tell you something. If we have somebody else dropping bombs that cost a half a million dollars a piece on the top -- if we have somebody helping us, that's not so bad. You understand that. That's not so bad. But I had people that I'm running against saying, like, that was a terrible thing. It's not a terrible thing. We have a situation in Libya where a friend of mine is just saying, so, we had Gaddafi, he killed the terrorists, he ran his place. Not a good man. Same thing you could say with Iraq, with Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein was a plus-10 at killing terrorists, that's one thing. If our presidents would have gone away and gone to the beach, the Middle East would be a far better place than it is right now. I don't say it would be run by nice people, but you know, it would be a far better place. The mistakes we've made in the Middle East are so astronomical. Now here's the thing: ISIS is now.... A friend of mine who's very much involved in the energy business, ISIS is controlling the oil now in Libya. How did we let that happen?
So just turning back.
And by the way, that oil? That is a great oil, and it's a lot of oil. And they're controlling it.
We were looking over your 1990 book, Surviving at the Top.
Right.
And thinking about, what would happen if Trump's president of the United States? And you -- this is a line from your book, then: "The same assets that excite me in the chase often, once they are acquired, leave me bored. For me, you see, the important thing is the getting, not the having." If you get the presidency, you are going to have it.
Yeah, but see, that's not the getting. The getting, for me, is to make our country great again. The getting -- that's just a part of it. The getting the position is not the real getting. For me, the getting is -- and that's when I'll say, congratulations everyone, my job is finished. We will make our country financially strong again. When you have 19... I had a woman come up to me. A wonderful woman. I said this one or two times in the speech. She said, "Mr. Trump, I love you. You're so incredible. I'm voting for you 100 percent, but could you stop saying you're going to make our country rich again?" I said, "I understand what you're saying -- it doesn't sound nice. But without being rich again, we can't be great again." I am going to make our country rich again. We are, the thing I didn't like about The Washington Post, they didn't put down my real statements as to Japan and everything else. They make it sound like I want Japan to have nuclear weapons. I don't. And by the way, other people have said this too. I don't mind taking care of Japan. But they have to help us out more, monetarily. We can't protect the entire world. You look at our military budget, it's massive compared to any other country. But what are we doing? We're taking care of the military needs of all these countries. And these countries are much richer than us. We're not a rich country. We're a debtor nation. We've got to get rid of -- I talked about bubble. We've got to get rid of the $19 trillion in debt.
How long would that take?
I think I could do it fairly quickly, because of the fact the numbers....
What's fairly quickly?
Well, I would say over a period of eight years. And I'll tell you why.
Would you ever be open to tax increases as part of that, to solve the problem?
I don't think I'll need to. The power is trade. Our deals are so bad.
That would be $2 trillion a year.
No, but I'm renegotiating all of our deals, Bob. The big trade deals that we're doing so badly on. With China, $505 billion this year in trade. We're losing with everybody. And a lot of those deals -- a lot of people say, how could the politicians be so stupid? It's not that they're stupid. It's that they're controlled by lobbyists and special interests who want those deals to be made.
So we want to go back and tell our readers about this interview, and we'll run the transcript of it, I'm sure. When does the coalition building begin?
You're talking now again?
Yes. OK, that's great. Is that....
... Phase two. We'll call it -- at least treat me fairly in phase one, but phase two.
Of course.
The coalition building begins -- I believe -- when it's decided who wins. Hopefully I'm going to win. The coalition building for me will be when I win. Vince Lombardi, I saw this. He was not a big man. And I was sitting in a place with some very, very tough football players. Big, strong football players. He came in -- these are tough cookies -- he came in, years ago -- and I'll never forget it, I was a young man. He came in, screaming, into this place. And screaming at one of these guys who was three times bigger than him, literally. And very physical, grabbing him by the shirt. Now, this guy could've whisked him away and thrown him out the window in two seconds. This guy -- the player -- was shaking. A friend of mine. There were four players, and Vince Lombardi walked in. He was angry. And he grabbed -- I was a young guy -- he grabbed him by the shirt, screaming at him, and the guy was literally.... And I said, wow. And I realized the only way Vince Lombardi got away with that was because he won. This was after he had won so much, OK? And when you have these coaches that are just as tough as him but they don't win, there's revolutions. OK? Nobody.... But Vince Lombardi was able to win, and he got -- I have never seen anything like it. It was such a vivid impression. You had this big powerful guy, and you had Vince Lombardi, and he grabbed him by the shirt and he was screaming at him, he was angry at him.
But to do that -- a colleague of ours....
No, to do that you have to win.
Yes. But David Maraniss, a colleague of ours, wrote the book on Vince Lombardi.
Yeah.
"When Pride Still Mattered." Right? What Vince Lombardi did, he got to the point of winning by building a coalition of 11 players on the field. He couldn't have a guard and a tackle who were not part of the team.
OK, let me answer this way, because I think it will be a very positive ending. Because I agree with you. Ultimately, I will build a coalition. I think it's too soon. I really do. I think it's too soon. Now, I may be wrong. But this isn't something I needed to do. This is something I want to do. I want to give back, and I'll do a fantastic job. And I know politicians. I know them all. They're only talented at one thing: getting elected. Now, you have some that have certain assets, but they're talented at one thing: getting elected. Raising funds, and getting elected. OK? And when I first ran, Charles Krauthammer said, and this was before I had run, and he was sitting there -- I told you this story. He was sitting on Fox. And he said, this is one of the most talented fields of senators and governors and people running for office in the history of our country, and certainly since World War II. Now this is about two months before I'm announcing. And I'm saying to myself, wow. That's tough. You know, here's a guy who must know. It's tough. They also said I wouldn't run and I ran. But I said, wow, that's a big statement. I said, all right, but I'm doing it. Then I decide -- top of the escalator -- I said to my wife, come on, let's go. Deep breath, went down, did it. OK. Now I've defeated those people, most of them. I've defeated them. And I say, really? Meaning to his statement. Really? Not a lot of talent.
So we have on the media, which you are quite critical....
Media treats me very unfairly, and very inaccurately.
OK, and the question is, why? And if I may, Richard Nixon, something he said... about the media, what it does, the media looks in the mirror instead of looking out the window -- and gather facts and listen to other people -- they're more interested in themselves. Is that part of the problem?
Well, I think they're more interested in hits. I did a thing the other day with -- on CNN -- with Anderson Cooper. I don't know if you saw the rating. Give him the ratings, if you have it. Do you have the ratings?
You have them, sir.
They were through -- I just got this. They were through the roof. Here. Mine was through the roof, meaning my hour was through the roof. Now, that's good and bad. The bad is they want to cover me too much, and they write things that maybe they shouldn't be writing. But those were phenomenal. Won the evening, beat everybody, etcetera, etcetera. My segment, not the other segments. The other segments did all right, but my segment was one of the highest-rated shows in a long time and beat everybody on cable -- beat everybody on television that night. So you'll take a look. That's good and it's bad. The bad is they want to do nothing but cover me. They write stories that are -- that don't even make sense. I'm just saying, I wish I could be covered accurately and fairly by the media.
By why, then? Is this ideology, is this partisanship, is it laziness? What is it?
Well, it could be some laziness. Today they want the clicks. In the old days they wanted the ratings, or they wanted to sell newspapers. Today they see if somebody clicks. So they do a story on me and they get clicks all over the place. They do a story on somebody else, it doesn't matter. All I can say is this. I wish I could be treated fairly by the media. And if I was treated fairly by the media, I think you would see a very big difference in coalition and coalition building and a lot of things. But with that being said, I'm not ready to do coalition building. But when I do -- I tell that Vince Lombardi story -- if and when I win, it will be really easy to build up a coalition. One other thing. I told you this. We are getting calls from so many people that you speak to, you speak to, that are saying, oh we don't like Trump, we've got to stop Trump. They're calling me. They're talking to you and they're calling me. Because they think I'm going to win.
Well the next step is getting them off the phone and out into the public.
Yeah, but we're already -- look, we already have.... Chris came in, and Carson came in. We already have a lot of people. We are getting calls from people that you're writing about, or other people are writing about, and I'm telling you, names that you wouldn't believe. Bob, you -- the greatest skeptic probably of all time -- even more than you. That's only because he's older than you. He's seen more. People that you wouldn't even think about would be calling are calling. They want to make a deal. They want to come on board.
But you know what they tell us? We call the same people. Or I've been calling the same people. You know what they say about Trump? So much promise, political talent, yet he seems to have a blind spot. When he's ahead, he seems to pull back. That's maybe not the view you have, I understand. But that is how a lot of Washington people see it. They think you get so close to the nomination, and then things happen....
I can only say this: my whole life has been about winning. My whole life. I've won a lot. And one little example? This building. This was one of the most sought-after buildings in the history of the General Services Administration. Owned by them for many years. The landlord to the United States, right? Every major company -- almost everybody -- I don't have to -- obviously, look, the best location in Washington. Right between the Capitol and the White House.
Great building.
The best location, best building. The walls are four foot thick of solid granite. Amazing how they were able to lift it up. I mean, frankly, amazing. This is before they had cranes as we know them today. Unbelievable place. And it will be one of the great hotels in the world. Everybody wanted it. Every hotel company. Everybody. Pritzker wanted it. Who's closer to Obama than Pritzker? Hyatt wanted it. They had the Jewish Museum all lined up. They had everything all lined up.... They own Hyatt. Hyatt didn't get it. The reason I got it was because I have an unbelievable balance sheet -- because they wanted to make sure it got done -- and because of the fact that I had a great concept.
But let's....
But think of it: I got it in the Obama administration.
Understand.
And people say to me, Bob, how the hell did you get the most sought -- after real estate asset perhaps in the history of the GSA -- and you understand what I mean by that.
Of course.
You know, they have land in the middle of nowhere, nobody cares about it. They say, how did you get the most sought-after asset perhaps in the history of the GSA?
And your political allies say the same exact thing. They appreciate that part of your profile and your skill. They talk about it all the time. All we're saying is, they also -- they're concerned that you're hurting yourself along the way as you get close to the nomination.
Well don't forget, they've been concerned about that 10 times during the course of this last....
Yeah, but here's what's going on, we think. And it has to do with psychology. And one of the things you learn, being a reporter, being a builder with your background, is that everyone is concerned about themselves.... These people feel disrespected. They feel that they've not been given their dignity.
They will be loved. At the right time, they will be loved.
And they want in.
Yeah, I know.
And what, to use your term, you've built a wall to a certain extent. You've said, I am the Lone Ranger. I am doing this on my own.
No, at the right time I want them in.
OK, but....
I just think it's early.
OK, but suppose you needed to do that sooner.
I'd be capable of doing it. I just think it's....
Will you call us the day it starts?
I will.
Because that's....
And some of the people that are calling me -- and maybe I should be calling them -- but some of the people that are calling me and calling him, in all fairness, and calling others, too. One called you. But some of these people that are well-known, and people you've -- that would be very interesting to you. These people want in. And I'm taking them in. They're going to come in.
Maybe you have to reach out, then.
Yeah. Because to a certain extent, I should be calling them, they shouldn't have to be calling me.
Yes, exactly.
You're right.
Right, that's the key thing. You're always talking about people calling you.
And I'm going to be doing that very soon.
Including the foreign policy meetings that you have done, including the private meetings we've done.
Well, we had a good meeting this morning for foreign policy, you know, and we've had some pretty good meetings.
We're not questioning that there are organizational efforts. We're just saying....
No, at the right time. You know, it's an interesting statement that Bob....
You love talking, though, about how people call you, but we often don't hear about Trump calling....
No?
We know you called McConnell once or twice.
I should be calling them.
More.
And I will be calling them. As soon as I feel that time is right.
And it goes back to the point about VP: you do acknowledge there is a limitation you have in this town, in this political place of Washington.
Sure, sure. I've been a very political person all my life.
Understood.
I've been on the other side, but still I've been very political....
Different. Donor and a politician.
Well, I've gotten unbelievable political things done: zoning. This building. Bob, how did I get this building?
When you call a senator up now, and you pitch yourself, as you near the nomination, what do you say to them? When you're calling them cold?
Well first of all, I do call some people that have just lost. Meaning, you know, they supported Rubio, they supported this. And we've dealt with.... Honestly, a lot of people are calling me, but I should be calling them. And in a pretty near distance, right now, already, I'm going to start calling them. But I love the point you're making. This is a point that you're making, but it's a point I agree with. I should be calling....
Yes. Because we have -- it's not making -- Bob Costa and I are making it because we hear it from people.
Yeah. They don't know how to get in.
There is the sound of silence. And yeah, exactly.
And then they get vicious. At the right point, I'm going to be calling them. One thing I'm going to do....
Who's going to be the first call?
I will be call... that's a very good case, I better not tell you that. I'll let you know when I make it. OK?
OK. And we have to have phase....
One quick thing I'm going to do, a lot of people are saying, oh, the judges.... To me, the judges -- because there's going to be a lot of them in these next four years. We've got one already that was unexpected in Scalia. So the judges are going to be important. You're going to have either super-liberal judges, or you're going to have conservative judges. So important. They don't know me well enough. Well, what kind of judges? I'm going to do something. It was my idea, and I think it was a good idea. And I spoke to Senator Sessions and I spoke to other people, and I'm getting names. The Federalist people. Some very good people. The Heritage Foundation. I'm getting names, and I'm going to submit a list of about 10 names, 10 or 12 names, as judges. I'm going to announce that these are the judges, in no particular order, that I'm going to put up. And I'm going to guarantee it. I'm going to tell people. Because people are worried that, oh, maybe he'll put the wrong judge in. Like people -- my sister is on the court of appeals. Very smart. She's a very smart, very highly respected person. Very smart.
People keep trying to get her to talk, and she won't.
You know what?
Does she have a nondisclosure agreement?
She's fantastic. She's the exact opposite of me. People say, is she really your sister? She's a brilliant person. Highly respected. When the press calls, I say, listen, they want to do a great story. They actually had a nice story about her in The Washington Post recently. But she doesn't want to talk to the press, because she feels as a judge she should not be speaking to the press. Something very nice about that. She's right.
I disagree, but....
As a judge. No, but as a judge.
As a reporter, he disagrees.
Oh, as a reporter. But there's something nice about that. She feels....
But it's not just the individual calls, it's the message of inclusiveness, that it doesn't come through.
Bob, I've been hit very hard.
Here's the problem I think you may face. You start an inclusive message, you turn that corner. Let's say you're the nominee and you say, 'You know what? I'm going to tell Woodward who I called. I'm going to start being a unifier.' But maybe so many bridges have been burned within the party that not everyone's going to be willing....
It's possible, but I don't think so. I've been here before.
And you may say to yourself, I wish I had built relationships sooner.
Don't forget, I've been hit hard. I went in one of 17 and they hit me harder than anybody. And I hit back very hard. Harder than they hit me. Jeb: low energy. Little Marco. Names that were devastating. I think the low energy Jeb, all of a sudden you see him running down the street to try and show he's got high energy. And it wasn't him, and it became worse. I hit back very hard. I am telling you, almost all of these people that you would never think would ever -- will want to come on board. But I've got to win first. That's why I told you that Vince Lombardi story. Because I think it's a great story. Anyway, I have to go. Let's do it again.
Who's called the meeting, Donald? Did you or did they call it?
I think it was probably mutually called. We have been talking and we have been dealing a lot. We have been tabulating up, as you know, Missouri just came in where we won Missouri. Tabulation just was finalized. We actually picked up additional votes and we had a great time in Missouri.
All right. No, I know, but someone had to pick up the phone or send the email or the text to the other. I'm just curious if they are the ones.
I'm not even sure. I'm not even sure. I think it was very mutually set up and I was in Washington because we had a foreign policy team meeting today. We have some wonderful people that we met on board. I'm setting up a board with various people having to do with foreign policy, I did that and then I go back shortly tomorrow. I'm going back to Wisconsin and I look forward to that and we just had a great PPP poll coming out, I guess I picked up quite a bit in terms of the Wisconsin vote. But nationwide we're leading big league. So, I think that's why, you know, the RNC want to do meet.
Donald, even if you get 1237 or 1240, they can say, you know, instead of a majority these rules committee says it's going to be a super majority and you are going to need 1600.
No, that won't happen. We have millions of people more than anybody else. You know, I have millions and millions of people more than anybody else. What's happening is really been a phenomena. It's been reported all over. Really one of the big stories in all of politics worldwide. The Republican count for votes is up so much since four years ago like some of the places are up over 100 percent. Lines are five blocks long. It's been amazing. So, I don't think anybody would even think about playing around with that.
All right. Maybe you should get Ryans and the RNC to sign a pledge.
Well, I will say this. I go a step further though, I think that if we get the 1237, if we break the 1237 that's fine. But I think, frankly, you know, if you look at it, we had many, many people running so that many of those early primaries we would have, you know, 10 people and seven people and six people would have a lot of people in them.
Yes.
And it's very, very hard to break that number, despite that I think I will break that number. However, if we are millions of votes ahead of everyone else and hundreds of delegates ahead of everyone else, I really think that whoever has that kind of an advantage should get it. I think it's awfully hard to take that away.
Do you believe in punishment for abortion? Yes or no, as a principle?
The answer is that has to be some form of punishment.
For the woman.
Yes, there has to be some form.
Ten years or 20?
That I don't know.
Why not?
I don't know.
Now, I know you have since clarified your point in written statements but --
I have clarified it, you really ought to heart whole thing. I mean, this is a long convoluted question. This was a long discussion and they just cut it out and, frankly, it was extremely -- it was really convoluted and if, in fact, abortion was outlawed the person performing the abortion, the doctor or whoever it may be that is really doing the act is responsible for the act not the woman is responsible. So, that's the way I have always felt. I have had the same -- I have had the same stance exactly as Ronald Reagan. I mean, I have had it and I have had it from the beginning. So, my stance is the exact same as Ronald Reagan's.
So, a lot of people are making a lot of hay out of this. Donald, I'm trying to figure out, did you misspeak or did you misunderstand the question?
Well, it could be that I misspoke. But this was a long, convoluted subject. We talked about Catholicism and his religion. And, you know, Chris went back and forth about that and this was a very long, convoluted discussion which, frankly, they don't want on television because it was too long.
Uh-hm.
But you know, just as I said it, and I must tell you this is the same -- my stance is the same stance as Ronald Reagan. And, if, in fact, abortion was outlined, the person performing that act is responsible, not the woman.
You can tell the Middle East we are not using a nuclear weapon?
I would never say that. I would never take any of my cards off the table.
How about Europe?
I'm not going to take it off the table.
You might use it in Europe.
No, I don't think so.
OK. What's that all about?
Well, I don't want to take cards off the table. I would never do that. The last person to press that button would be me. Hey, I'm the one that didn't want to go into Iraq from the beginning. The last person that wants to play the nuclear card believe me is me. But you can never take cards off the table either from a moral stand -- from any standpoint and certainly from a negotiating standpoint.
Donald, I understand they are not taking the cards off the table for ISIS or Islamic terror. But when Chris expanded to Europe, what about that?
Europe is a big place. I'm not going to take cards off the table. We have nuclear capability. Now, our capability is going down rapidly because of what we're doing. It's in bad shape. The equipment is not properly maintained. There are all lot of talk about that. And that's a bad thing not a good thing. The last person to use nuclear would be Donald Trump. That's the way I feel. I think it is a horrible thing. The thought of it is horrible. But I don't want to take anything off the table. We have to negotiate. There will be times maybe when we're going to be in a very deep, very difficult, very horrible negotiation. The last person -- I'm not going to take it off the table. And I said it yesterday. And I stay with it.
A lot of people on the left saying you want to disband NATO. I don't understand that. But Donald before we go, we only have --
Just Eric, let me clarify. I never said that. I don't want to disband NATO but I don't want to pay for a vast majority of the cost of NATO, either. It's benefiting all of these countries, you have 28 countries in there. It's benefiting all of these countries. And some of them virtually nothing that pay peanuts. It's not fair. So, we have to be treated fairly. And we're not being treated fairly worldwide whether it's NATO or trade or anything else, we are not being treated fairly.
These meeting of foreign policy mines. We only have about 30 seconds or so. These are going to be advisors to you or just the back and forth you want to have a discussion.
No. These won't be advisors. These are very talented people, highly respected people, these people would be advisors.
All right. We're going to leave it right there, Mr. Donald Trump. Thank you very much.
OK. Thank you very much.
Mr. Trump, welcome back to "Fox News Sunday."
Thank you.
I want to talk to you about -- I want to talk to you about that. First of all, Wisconsin. How important is Wisconsin? How big a setback if you don't win there?
Well, I'd like to win it. Is it a big setback? I would like to win it.
Do you think it would jeopardize your ability to get to 1,237?
It would always be better to win. I think I get there anyway, but I like Wisconsin, I like the people of Wisconsin, I think they like me, I've had tremendous crowds. We've had a tremendous response, and I think I'm going to do very well in Wisconsin.
Do you believe in punishment for abortion, yes or no, as a principle?
The answer is that there has to be some sort of punishment.
It took you two written statements to clean that up.
Well, it took me really two statements because they were sort of different statements and they were on different subjects.
Do you agree it was a mistake?
Well, I -- as a hypothetical question, I would have rather asked it -- you know, answered it in a different manner, yes. I would have rather answered it in a different manner.
OK, fine. Do you know how many NATO soldiers have died in Afghanistan helping us after the 9/11 attack on the U.S.? Do you know how many NATO soldiers have died?
I'm not saying -- I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I'm saying it's unfair --
A thousand is the answer.
Fine, I'm saying -- and it's a lot of soldiers. I'm saying it's a -- I'm saying it's unfair to us. It's unfair to us as a country.
Well, in Afghanistan we are.
Sure. But, we --
You talk about the fact that you've only been a politician for eight months, but there are other issues that you've gotten in trouble on in the last week or so that have more to do with just judgment and temperament. For instance, the fact that you spent days going after Ted Cruz's wife and her looks --
Excuse me, excuse me. Ted Cruz --
Let me just ask --
Ted Cruz came after me --
No, he didn't.
Well, he did through my wife.
No, he didn't.
He took a picture --
No, he didn't.
Oh, of course he did, of course he did.
Do you have any evidence that he knew about the attack by the independent super PAC?
My evidence is total common sense. He knew those people, those people are 100 percent for them, they coordinated together. I have no doubt about it in a million years. He did that attack -- and this was just --
Question: why not just apologize to her?
Because --
I mean, he did grab her.
Because let me tell you why: loyal person, number one.
I'm not saying you fire him.
And when she wrote out, early on, before she knew she was on tape, that it was that she was practically thrown to the ground, I mean, I wish I had it here, I'd read her statement --
I know what she said.
That didn't happen. OK? Do you agree with that?
I agree with you. But why not just apologize --
Excuse me, Chris, no, but she lied. Do you agree that she lied?
I think she completely misrepresented it early on. I do.
Early on is all that matters.
But why turn one day into two weeks?
Chris -- well, at least it shows I'm loyal, because the easiest thing for me to do would have been to destroy that man's life. And I would have fired him immediately. Had she fallen to the ground, or almost fallen to the ground like she said -- she didn't even change the expression on her face. She kept walking.
I understand, but the idea is not to have a nuclear arms race in the Northern Pacific, on the Korean peninsula.
Are you ready?
But they do pay us.
They pay us peanuts.
They pay us almost $1 billion, South Korea. I think $2 billion in Japan.
That's peanuts compared to what we're talking about and compared to the real threat.
You want to have a nuclear arms race on the Korean peninsula?
In many ways, and I say this, in many ways, the world is changing. Right now, you have Pakistan and you have North Korea and you have China and you have Russia and you have India and you have the United States and many other countries have nukes.
With nukes?
Maybe they would be better off -- including with nukes, yes, including with nukes.
In South Korea, with nukes?
South Korea is right next door, just so you understand.
Are you ruling out running as an independent third party candidate? Are you ruling that out?
Look, I'm by far the frontrunner as a Republican. I want to run as a Republican. I will beat Hillary Clinton.
But if you don't get the nomination?
We're going to have to see how I was treated. I'm going to have to see how I was treated. Very simple.
So you're not ruling it out?
I just want to be treated -- it's not a question of win or lose. It's a question of treatment. I want to be treated fair.
Mr. Trump --
Thank you.
It's always interesting. I don't think you could be dull even if you wanted to be.
Well, I think I may act very presidential, I'll be dull. But that will be fine.
But here is what happened. Your campaign manager said she was delusional when the report came out. He said it didn't happen. When the report first came out, did you talk to him?
Well, I could see maybe not even knowing that it happened because...
But did you talk to him about this event?
I looked -- I did speak to him. But here's the thing.
And what did he say?
It was such a minor incident that he might not have even known what was going on. I'm not sure that he knew her. I think he said he really didn't know her.
I would like to talk about his statement, since he works for you. You want to be...
I will, but nobody wants to talk about her statement.
But, Mr. Trump, he said he didn't touch her. He said she was delusional. You said she was making it up. The videotape shows she wasn't making it up.
Well, you know, if you look at the videotape, you don't even see a grab. You see her almost being blocked out.
Did Corey Lewandowski tell the truth when he said he didn't touch her?
I don't know, because I can't tell you in what context. The event...
You don't know that he touched her or not?
The event to me, to me -- what do I know? The event to me...
Is it OK for a man to put a hand on a woman?
Well, I don't think -- I'm not even sure he did that.
You felt threatened by her?
I didn't really feel threatened. OK? I guess I could say I should sue her. I didn't really feel threatened. But I didn't like somebody grabbing me. And I didn't like somebody asking me questions when that was all over.
Here is a question. It comes out, a video shows that he did grab her, what he said was not -- turned out not to be true, you said she made it up.
But what she said wasn't true, John. Excuse me.
But the main point is, did he touch her or not? He did touch her.
I think this.
But the question is, for you, as the person with the power in this relationship -- you have got all these people working for you. You have got all these big, huge buildings. Why not be the bigger person and say, she was treated roughly, she was my guest, I apologize to her, and let's move on?
Well, it's not my job to apologize to her. I have nothing -- I just happened to be walking through.
Your original answer, you mean.
My original.
But do you have a feeling how they should change? There are a lot of laws you want to change. You have talking about them, everything from libel to torture. Anything you would want to change on abortion?
At this moment, the laws are set. And I think we have to leave it that way.
Did you think it's murder, abortion?
I have my opinions on it, but I would rather not comment on it.
But you don't disagree with that proposition that it's murder?
What proposition?
That abortion is murder?
No, I don't disagree with it.
Let me ask you about the abortion question, which you have explained, the hypothetical nature of it, and also your answer on the spread of nuclear weapons. You said you were against proliferation, but then you said you seemed to be OK with South Korea or Japan maybe getting one.
No, it's totally misquoted.
Right.
We cannot continue to do this.
Have you been studying up?
I have. I have.
What did you ask them?
More than anything else, I discussed nuclear. To me, the single biggest problem that this world has -- and we will knock out ISIS fast and we will do a lot of things -- but the single biggest problem that the world has is nuclear.
In what way do you mean that's the biggest?
I think, if somebody gets nuclear weapons, that is a disaster.
What worries you the most about that?
I think that probably worries me the most.
Which country, though, of all the ones...
I think it could be many people. It's not even countries. It's splinter groups. It's people.
Let me talk about another meeting you had in Washington with the Republican National Committee.
Yes.
Did they treat you fairly? Are they treating you fairly?
Well, I would rather let you know in about six months from now. I don't know. I mean...
Wouldn't Donald Trump do that?
No. That's not America.
You wouldn't play every angle to win?
When I win the state, I'm not supposed to get less delegates than somebody that got beat.
But as a businessman, you play every angle you can within the law.
No, but that's not America. Sure. Sure.
Well, a lot of people in the game who know this game, who play it...
I don't care about the game. I care about the people. And when you go in and win a state, and then you don't get the delegates?
One of the things you're saying...
Now, I got some. I go some. I got many, but I didn't get the number that I should be entitled to.
We are going to that have to leave it there. Mr. Trump, thanks so much.
Thank you very much.
I don't think you'd ever get sick of this, right?
Thank you. This is so great. Nice place. Beautiful theater.
He treats you badly when you're not there.
Well, perhaps, I mean, but he's always been, you know, fine.
But the reality is, that's not the law.
And -- well, he said -- but as a hypothetical question, that was a hypothetical answer that was not a wrong answer. And there were other people that wrote me letters, and I mean, by the hundreds, saying, that was a great answer to that question the way it was phrased.
Did he make exceptions -- because it's a -- look, it's a very sensitive issue. It's a very personal issue. I know that my position of making exceptions for rape, incest and the mother's life are inconsistent a little bit with my belief that life begins at conception.
Right.
Well, but the -- it was -- the press conference was over.
It was over. And it was a long press conference.
Let me ask -- so I -- I think it -- you have now been...
By the way, Jupiter, Florida, is a great place. I, I respect it so much.
For nothing!
And I always say thank goodness we had that tape because I can imagine -- you know, when she saw that tape, all of a sudden, the story sort of changed a little bit. It wasn't -- remember, you have to look at her first statement -- pulled to the ground or almost pulled to the ground. And it was, like, pretty vicious-sounding. And then I saw the tape. So I think people should look at that. I think it's a great injustice.
Let me ask this question. You now -- do you remember the day you came down Trump Towers? Melania was with you.
Yes.
Your family was there.
Yes.
You've been at this what, nine months?
Yes.
Nine months.
From June 16th.
But the strategy is to take this...
Yes.
We had more people...
... the Republican should...
... than we had room for here.
But you -- look at you. I mean, you were supposed to have just a little audience, and now they have to open up all the decks.
But let me ask you something.
There's something...
China is worse.
Oh, China, $505 billion. And we're going to stop all that. And we have the greatest -- you know many of them, and you know they're friends of mine, and have endorsed me. Carl Icahn...
But how do we...
We're going to get the greatest negotiators and...
Is that enough to get Americans back to work?
Oh, it's going to be so good. It's -- we're losing, we're losing all of our jobs, folks. We're losing so much. And what they do is the monetary manipulation. They devalue their currencies to such an extent. And they're grand masters. And we have people in Washington, they don't even know what's happening to us. You take a look at Komatsu in Japan, they make tractors. Look what they're doing to Caterpillar. So many companies are just absolutely --
Would you put forward a balanced budget your first budget, or will it take a couple of years?
No, no, but it will take fairly quickly, and it can be done.
Do you -- how important is it that government -- for example, are there any departments you would eliminate? I like the penny plan. You cut a penny, you eliminate baseline budgeting, all important and, from my perspective -- energy I think would create a lot of jobs.
Well, it has got to be loosened up. It has got to be loosened up. You know, we take our coal, because I'm somebody that believes in clean coal. I believe in all forms of energy. I think it's fine.
Outside the Kennedy compound, that's where I would put it.
Well, no -- yes, but they don't want it.
Oil, natural gas, coal, nuclear?
I am totally in favor. You know, nuclear had a big setback when they had the problem in Japan. They were all set to go. But new nuclear is really -- and very, very inexpensive. You look at certain countries like France, not that I want to copy France --
We've got to take a break.
OK.
And I'll bring Melania back in here because he wants you to be more presidential. We know every election cycle what the Democratic playbook is going to be. It's going to be that if you're the nominee, you're racist, you're sexist, war on women, you want dirty air and water, and throw granny over the cliff. So the question is, first of all, do you have a nickname for Hillary?
Well, you know, I haven't really. I just haven't wanted to give it yet. I sort of do but I want to knock off the next two people, and then I can focus on Hillary.
It's 3:00 a.m.
Well, she wasn't there to answer the call. I mean, she wasn't there.
So without giving it away, do you have your strategy?
I do. I have a strategy but --
Already in place?
It's too early. I don't even know if she's going to be the nominee. It's too early to even --
I have 1,000 pages of opposition research on her. Remember, I was the one out there on Obama, warning the country that he was a radical, you know, Reverend Wright, 20 years in that church, "G-D America, " Alinskyite, Acorn, Bill Ayers, Bernardine Dohrn, no one wanted to talk about it.
It says better than anything when he won't use the term "radical Islamic terrorism."
It says everything.
And with -- you saw what happened yesterday with the French where he had the word --
They edited it out.
It had to happen. He said it was a technical mistake. This is what I mean. Those two words or three words were edited out. It was a technical mistake. To think, I mean --
Hi.
Hi.
Let's go in and see if we can get him to answer a question for two. How are you feeling this morning?
We feel great. I mean, the turnout has been fantastic. I think we're going to have a great day. We had a phenomenal poll come out last night, actually a pollster that called South Carolina. You know, I wasn't supposed to win South Carolina. We won in really a landslide, Chris, and we feel really good about this.
I want to give you a chance to answer these reports that there's a lot of infighting in your campaign, that it's in a state somewhat of disarray.
I haven't heard those reports. I mean, we have a great campaign, I'm No. 1 by a lot. Millions more votes than Cruz or anybody else. I have millions of more votes, as you know. I have almost 300 more delegates. I have not heard anything about infighting. I don't know where you hear it.
Do you feel -- well, it's being reported and there are people within your campaign who are suggesting --
I'm the only -- no, I'm the only -- I doubt that.
None of the people who have been brought in --
Let me ask you, are we No. 1?
You are No. 1. But will you --
Do we have millions nor votes than anybody else? Will we win today, I can't tell you, but we're going to have a great turnout and I think we're going to do very well.
So why aren't they getting that message?
I'll tell you what, because I get a very unfair press. I get very, very unfair press having to do with women and many other things. I mean --
I told that to Charlie Sykes last week, Mr. Trump.
Yes, and Charlie Sykes, I mean, this guy is third rate. He's a third rate talent and he frankly -- and the governor, you know the story with the governor. But the women -- I think that I'm going to do very well with women. We just had a big meeting, many women at the meeting, and they like me best because they say you're best with the military, you're best with the borders, you're best with security. And I said I'm going to be best for women's health issues, much better than Hillary, much better than anybody else. So I think we're going to do fantastically well with women.
Great! Great job!
I think we're going to do very well. I hope so.
And finally no changes anticipated in your campaign staff? You have full confidence in everyone within it and you see no signs of any kind of unrest or infighting within your campaign?
No, it's just the media again. I get the most unfair media. Nobody ever even called me. This is the first time I've been asked this question. Nobody has ever called me about this. We're No. 1 in every category -- No. 1 in delegates, No. 1 in votes by millions. I don't mean by like two votes, by millions and millions of votes. And I'm very happy.
And you don't feel ill served, for example, to go on to a very popular talk radio show and you said you didn't know they had been leading an anti-Trump show.
No, because if you listen to that -- I don't mind that. I mean, you go into the enemy camp sometimes, but you have to take on the enemy. He's not a very smart guy, not a very bright guy, and if you listen to the entire show, you would've said Donald Trump totally won that debate. I was on the show for 15 minutes and everybody that listened to that show said you convinced me. I've had many people call me that were going to vote against me. They listened to that show. By the end of the show, and they wrote me -- I have two or three letters -- they wrote and tweeted and all of these, and they said by the end of that show, you have totally convinced me. I'm voting for Trump. So sometimes you go into unfriendly territory. That's part of the game.
And that's what you consider Wisconsin to be?
No, you said about a radio talk show host --
You were just talking about the radio host.
See, that's what I mean about the dishonest media.
I'm asking you a question, allowing you to answer it.
Excuse me. Excuse me, excuse me. You're asking me about a show host. I said he was unfriendly territory. Then you say is that, what, Wisconsin?
Well, let me ask you finally, going into New York --
I think I'm going to do great.
-- and Pennsylvania --
Excuse me.
-- what's the strategy?
Excuse me. I think I'm going to do great in Wisconsin. The polls are showing me doing really, really well in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut. I mean, it looks like we're going to have tremendous victories there. But right now, I'm interested right here. We'll see how we do tonight. And I think the results will surprise you.
Mr. Trump, we're here in upstate New York today, which has often lagged behind New York City economically. What, if you were President... what specifically would you do economically to help a place like Upstate New York?
Well, we have to open up the trade. We have to open it up. The trade has just decimated our country. Between NAFTA and everything else, now they're talking about TPP, which is going to be worse than NAFTA, and they're taking the jobs away from not only New York state but the entire country. Our country is a mess. We're losing jobs to Mexico, China, and everywhere else, we have nothing. And when you look at upstate New York, you look at Rochester, and all these places that I've known for years, and it's like decimation, what's happening. So we have to stop with these horrible trade deals and we have to make great trade deals.
Hillary Clinton was in Buffalo on Friday. She touted her job creation in Buffalo and upstate New York. What would you do to create jobs?
Well, Hillary Clinton has been involved in government her whole life. She's been involved, between being a Senator and being a Secretary of State, she's been involved in this administration for years. This administration has done absolutely nothing to help Rochester and help upstate New York. It's a disgrace what's happened. And now they talk. All the politicians, they all talk, no action. Hillary Clinton has been involved for years. She's done nothing.
Mr. Trump, you've called for a total and complete ban on Muslim immigration. We have a significant, not only Muslim population, but a population of immigrants from every country. In Buffalo. In Western New York. What do you say to them?
Well, I said I called for a temporary ban, you totally mis-phrased the question.
A temporary total and complete ban.
You didn't say that.
That's exactly what I meant.
You didn't say that. OK. I've called for a temporary ban until we find out what we're doing. Because we don't know what's going on. You look at what's flooding into our country now from Syria, we have no idea where they're coming from, we have no idea. There's no paperwork, there's no documentation, we have absolutely no idea what we're doing, and who knows where these people are from and who knows what they're gonna do in terms of damage?
For Western New Yorkers, can you clarify comments on punishments for women who have abortions?
Yeah, I've said it and I've said it very, very strongly. And it speaks for itself, what I said speaks very much for itself.
Mr. Trump, for our viewers in Western New York, can you clarify your comments on abortion?
It's been clarified many times. It's been clarified so beautifully and I think everybody knows exactly what I said. OK.
All right. You know from --
I think we are going to do great.
You know from reading "Killing Reagan" that he and you were not in the same universe as far as personality is concerned. Ronald Reagan was probably the least confrontational guy in the country. You are very confrontational guy. So, what I'm trying to get at is this. Nobody knows what's going to happen at the convention in Cleveland. It's going to be a mess. It's just going to be a mess. But, if do you get the nomination, then your supporters are used to you, Donald Trump, the confrontational guy takes no guff from anybody. In order to get those unfavorable down, you will going to have to be the softer, kindler Trump. I don't know if you can do that. I don't know if you can.
Well, I think I am a softer, kindler person if you want to know the truth, Bill. Again, you know, this has been a very strong competition. If Jeb Bush was supposed to win and I hit him hard and I won and, you know, Walker was supposed to win. They were all supposed to win and they are all gone. And, you know, to be honest I think I will get along with people and I think I will be a unifier including for the party and we hope to get there some time prior to the convention. So that the convention can actually be a unification project if you want to know the truth.
It's going to be very difficult to do that.
Well, the Republicans need that. Well, you know, I'm leaving right now, Bill. I'm leaving for Albany right after this. And we have 20,000 people in Albany. Yesterday we had 17,000 people --
Yes. Yes. I think you will win New York.
-- in Rochester, New York.
Yes. I think you win New York pretty handily.
Doing well.
But then you have to go out west again and it's a tougher territory for you out there. Now, the minorities, let's talk about the minorities. I defended you against Tavis Smiley last week. And I did it because I know you better than Tavis Smiley knows you. I don't even know if you know him.
He doesn't know me at all.
OK.
Bill, I have never met him.
Smiley brought in the fact that you were this racial arsonist. That's what he used. And I said, look, I have known the guy for 30 years and I have never seen any of that and you have got to give me an example and he really couldn't. But that's the perception in the African-American precincts that you are a racial guy you don't like them. Is there a strategy that you have or your staff has to negate that?
Well, I don't think it is the perception actually, Bill. I have tremendous numbers of African-Americans that work for me.
What's your message to them? What's your message to African- Americans?
My message is, I'm going to bring jobs back. My message is bringing jobs back to the country and they will going to have jobs. Because right now we don't have jobs. China has the jobs. Mexico has the jobs. Japan has the jobs. Everybody has the jobs. We don't have the jobs. The jobs have been taken out of the United States like we're a bunch of babies --
OK. So, it's an economic play. But what about the grievance industry ran by your friend Al Sharpton where, you know, not only do you have to bring prosperity to all Americans, not just Blacks, but we owe them. We owe the African-Americans because of the historical atrocities that they have had to live through, their families, their ancestors, how are you going to deal with that?
Well, I think we are going to do fine. Again, I think that --
What are you going to tell them what that comes up?
You will going to start to see it, I'm telling you, it's an economic message. If you look at President Obama, he has been a president for almost eight years. Will be eight years. You have with black youth, with African-American youth, you have a 59 percent unemployment with people of prime age, it's much higher than --
But how are you going to get jobs for them? Many of them are ill-educated and have tattoos on their foreheads and, you know, how are you going -- and I hate to be generalized about it but it's true. If you look at all the educational statistics, how are you going to give jobs to people who aren't qualified for jobs?
We're going to bring jobs back. We're going to have Apple computers made in this country. Not just --
We all know that. But it's more challenging --
They are going to Mexico every day. Well, wait a minute, Carrier and Nabisco and Ford and every company you can name, they are building in Mexico. They are not here because we have politicians that don't know what they're doing.
I got it.
They don't know what they're doing --
But it's more challenging in the African-American -- look, when we drive up to Yankee Stadium, we go through Harlem, alright? It's more challenging for a poor child in Harlem without parental guidance in a school that's falling apart than it is for some white kid out in garden city, all right? And you say you can bring jobs back. But, you know, if the kid isn't qualified to do the job and can't do the work. I mean, you have got to get into the infrastructure of the African-American community. Do you have any plan to do that?
Well, it is true. And it's about education. But it's also about spirit. A lot of people don't have spirit. Not only African-Americans, they don't have spirit in our country. I mean, I can tell you, plenty of white people that go to college, they borrow a lot of money, they get out and they can't get a job. The single biggest question I get it from young kids that are in colleges because I see them all over and they want to talk to me and I say what is it? And I said, before you even talk, I will tell you, you are borrowed up to the hilt and now you have graduated, you have done well in college, you can't get a job. They said, Mr. Trump, how did you know? It's a real problem that we have in this country.
All right.
We don't have jobs anymore. Our manufacturing is going to be gone if we keep it up. I mean, look at the numbers. Look at the recent numbers of manufacturing in the United States? It's going to be gone.
It's all going to the service and high tech. OK. I have to hold you over. I want you --
We don't have spirit in this country.
Yes. I mean, they don't believe that you are going to be able to -- the media in general does not believe you are going to be able to deliver on your promise to have Mexico pay for the wall. They don't believe that.
So easy. Bill so, easy.
Trade war starts if you stop remunerations going back and all of that. Because Mexico is our third largest trade partner. It's going to be chaos economic. But that's all speculation. But what isn't speculation --
Bill, one thing I would like to respond to, Bill.
Sure. Sure.
If a trade war starts. A trade war is only going to start unless they start treating us properly. They are treating us like a bunch of dummies in the United States. They are taking our jobs. They are taking our money. They are devaluing their currencies. You look at what China is doing with the currency and Japan, they are devaluing their currencies and they're just killing us.
OK. But they don't believe that you can solve this problem.
Now, I don't think that we are going to have a trade war but somebody has got to talk to them.
Look, people --
I think I can absolutely solve this problem.
The supporters believes you can. The media believes you can't. Now, I also had a conversation last week --
I think some of the media believes I can. I think some of the media believes I can.
Who?
And I can tell you. I absolutely can. Look what they are doing. You look at these countries -- Bill, you look at what these countries are doing to us, they way they treat us.
No, I know that. I know that. I'm talking about the media now.
They don't adheres to anything that are in these agreements which are terrible agreements to start off with.
All right.
I mean, they are terrible agreements.
So, look, your supporters believe you can do it. Your detractors say you can't.
I will do it. I will do it for the country. You know what it's called Bill, make America great again because our country is going to hell. Make America great again.
You have got to get those hats made in America by the way. Now, talking to Lesley Stahl.
They are made in America. Bill, wait, wait, wait. They are made in California.
OK.
Now, I know this. They are copied all over the place. But they are made in America. Believe me, the first thing I said when I did the hats, I said you better make sure they're made in America.
They're made in America. That's right.
They're made by -- excuse me, Bill. They're made by a company in California 100 percent. Now, I know they are copied all over the place and I can't help that. But my hats are made in America.
Good. Now, I have got to ask you this question. It's a tough question. But it's true. I was at the CBS Morning News a few weeks ago and they collectively, that program, they are appalled that you are leading in the Republican precincts. They think you are a vulgarian that you're not -- you don't have the class to run this country. You know that's the perception in a lot of network places. Does that bother you?
Well, I don't know that's the perception. I went to the Wharton school of finance. I was a very smart person and student and all of that and hopefully am. And, frankly, CBS Morning Show with Charlie Rose and all of them, they begged me to go on the show all the time.
Sure. Because you deliver high ratings.
-- like a month ago.
You deliver high ratings.
They begged me to go on the show.
Yes.
So I don't think the vulgarian is the right word. Perhaps they don't like me. They don't like my policies. They don't like my stance on trade.
You know the New York term in your face?
Well, well --
That's what they think.
You know, I'll tell you what. They certainly wanted me on their show because they beg. OK? They begged that I go --
Yes. Because you bring high ratings. Everybody knows you bring high ratings. That's why.
Well, whatever it is. I bring a lot of voters also. I mean, I bring a lot of people that want to see our country turn around.
Right. To see what you have to say.
As an example.
But do you --
You look at NAFTA, you looked at what happened to our country or you look at NATO, the way we are spending -- Bill, you look at NATO. The way we are spending --
All right.
-- so much money and we're benefiting all these other countries. We are like, Bill, we need a change. We need a change fast. We're not going to have a country left. Believe me.
I have got one more question I have to ask you. Don't you understand or do you? Maybe I'm wrong because I don't hang with these people. But the precincts, the elite precincts and the media, you know, and they just don't think that you have the style to run the country. Don't you feel that when you deal with them? Don't you feel that condescension? You know?
No, I don't feel that. I feel that they disagree with my policies because they want to have open borders. They want -- they don't mind that people are taking advantage of the country.
All right. So, it's a liberal conservative thing.
They don't mind that free trade is stupid trade.
You might be right about that.
America First. Make America great again.
The polls all have you at or above 50 percent, which of course is the magic number in the district-by-district primary contests --
One just came out, did you see? The Time Warner just came out, which is NY1, the big one, just came out at over 60 percent.
Do you think it's possible that you could snap up all the delegates, the 81 on the district level and the 14 for winning the state?
Well, I hope so. I'd love to see it. I can tell you one thing: Cruz with his horrible "New York values" statement and his non-support of anything coming to New York, and Kasich with his approval of NAFTA -- I don't know if you know, he was one of the big voters for NAFTA, which has stripped you of your jobs, meaning Albany and the state of New York and the country. And he raised his hand for that. I don't know how people could vote for people in New York that had that feeling. You saw the debate when Cruz got up -- and it was not only his words about New York values, which he was mocking, it was also his tone, the level of hatred he had. You saw that, everybody saw that.
You've been very critical of the primary process in other states. I've got to assume your people have made a close study of the rules in New York; there are of course the unpledged delegates as well as the pledged delegates. Do you see any problems on the horizon in terms of the state party supporting the winner?
No, I don't. At least with New York, you know where you stand. And at least with New York you have votes. In Colorado they took away the votes, and they did that after I entered (the race) -- because I would have won Colorado.... I mean, nobody voted in Colorado, which is terrible -- and a lot of people have agreed with me, I've had editorials agreeing, and a lot of people agreed. The voters of Colorado are absolutely angry because they're saying, 'We wanted to vote, and we can't vote.' But despite that I'm winning 22 states and Cruz is winning 10, and Kasich is winning one. And I don't know if you've seen, but I have millions of votes more than both of them -- millions So we're doing well, but still, it's not a good system when you're not letting the people vote. It's a democracy, you're supposed to let the people vote.
In a Q&A that Kasich did at the Capitol on Monday, he said that if the state Senate Republican majority wanted to remain the majority, they need to be running with a candidate like him in November. Many of your critics and Cruz's critics have said that running on a ticket with either of you at the top would be potentially disastrous. What's your response?
Yeah, well, I'm the only one that's going to beat Hillary Clinton. She knows that, everybody else knows that -- once I start. I haven't started. Don't forget: When I started (campaigning), everybody said, "Oh, he's just gonna have a good time,' etc., etc. In the meantime, I'm beating all these people, including Kasich -- so when Kasich's says he's the one who's going to win, why can't he beat me?...I've won 22 states, he's won one. He's one for 32.
The same New York polls you're referring to, when they move on to hypothetical general election matchups, they show both Clinton and Bernie Sanders beating all three of the standing Republican candidates. What do you attribute that to, and what are you going to be able to turn that around?
They can't win New York, the two guys.
That's certainly what the polls suggest.
But I can win New York. I think when I start campaigning in New York against her, assuming she gets away from her email problems, which is a question -- but assuming that it's her, I think I'll end up winning New York, based on jobs, on the economy, and I think we'll win it soundly.
What happens if next January doesn't find you in the White House? Is this the end of your electoral ambitions, going for the big brass ring? Or would you, for example, consider running for governor in 2018?
No, no. I've been a politician for nine months. We're going to make America great again. My whole campaign is make America great again. We're going to make America great again and we're going to bring jobs back, we're going to bring the economy back, we're going to strengthen greatly our military and take care of our vets, get rid of Obamacare and come up with a great plan. But no, I won't be -- depending on what happens, I mean right now I'm the leading candidate by far on the Republican side -- depending on what happens I certainly wouldn't be running for any other office.
Big day for you, got very good news. You were certified today the winner of the Missouri primary. It means you picked up another 12 delegates. Great polling numbers for you. The NY1 Baruch College poll, 60 percent in New York, way ahead of all the other candidates, and even the Quinnipiac poll I think had you around 55 percent.
Great.
Again, way ahead. So you've got some good news.
Thank you.
You have been very critical, though, of what happened in Colorado. And I want to read out some of the things you have said. You said the nominating system in Colorado is, quote, "rigged, disgusting, and dirty." You called it a corrupt deal full of crooked shenanigans. Ted Cruz is saying you're just being a whiner. I mean, the bottom line is, the rules are the rules. Didn't you just get outplayed on the ground?
No, I don't think so. Look, first of all, you and I watched Ted Cruz, and I watched him very strongly say, well, he's been winning, but, you know, I've won 22 states, and he's won 10, and we're really way up in votes, you know, in terms of the voters, which to me is very important, but it's never talked. I'm millions of votes ahead of him, and as you know, I'm hundreds of delegates ahead of him, but the Colorado thing was very, very unfair. And I thought Louisiana was very unfair. I won Louisiana. I won it easily.
You won the popular vote.
I won the popular vote.
And he got the delegates.
And because of all his shenanigans that goes on and this is...
But you call them shenanigans. Those are the rules.
I do. I do.
Didn't you know those rules?
You know why the rules -- I know the rules very well, but I know that it's stacked against me by the establishment. I fully understand it. We had people out there, and they weren't heard. And then, in fact, today, when it was announced -- the numbers were announced, they put out something on Twitter saying, oh, we stopped Trump, essentially, we stopped Trump, we stopped -- that was put out by the party in Colorado. The point is, it was stacked against us. Now...
You talk about the RNC, Reince Priebus, head of the RNC, tweeted yesterday, he said, quote, "The rules were set last year. Nothing mysterious. Nothing new. The rules have not changed. The rules are the same. Nothing different."
Anderson, they changed the rules a number of months ago. The people in...
About eight months ago.
Well, it's not very long ago.
You think they're actively working against you on the ground?
I don't know. I mean, I don't see it. It's not like it's -- I have 15 miles of proof. But certainly they should want to have a vote of the people of Colorado. The people of Colorado -- I would have won. I've won so many of the votes. I mean, the voting has been phenomenal. That's why I've won so many more states than Ted Cruz and Kasich.
Does it say, though, something about -- OK. You disagree with the process as it was in Colorado, but you had months to prepare. Does it say something -- and your critics say it says something about your leadership ability, if you -- for somebody who touts himself as somebody who's an organizational genius, who's created this amazing business organization, that you couldn't create an organization on the ground that can beat Ted Cruz's organization?
OK, number one, I started with a million dollar loan. I built a $10 billion company. It's a phenomenal company. Let me just tell you...
I just want to read you what Cory Gardner, who's a Republican senator from Colorado, said, because he's really annoyed at what you've been saying. He said essentially you're...
Well, he's a member of the establishment.
... that you're insulting these delegates who ran who are just regular people.
No, I'm insulting the system. The system is not a good system.
You've said in the past that if you weren't being treated fairly, you'd consider a third party run. Is that something that's still on the table?
Well, it's certainly something I don't want to do. Look, I'm winning by a lot. I -- you know, based on the numbers you just gave me from New York, I'm leading by more than 40 points.
One of the knocks on you -- and I know you disagree with it, is that you haven't given a lot of specifics to some of your policies. Your campaign has been saying, I think it was last week they started saying you were going to start putting out some very specific policy pronouncements.
But I have on tax, on tax. I have on many things.
You're going to be making more policy speeches in particular.
I'm going to start doing that, yes.
When is that going to start?
I did. I did one at AIPAC about concerning Israel, and it was met with raves. You even said it was good. But I did one on -- I'm going to be doing probably 10 over the next two months. A lot more.
You know when the next one is going to be and what the topic is going to be?
I would say over the next week.
And you still say it's obsolete?
Of course it's obsolete. It was done 68 years ago, and it hasn't changed.
You've given...
And, by the way, experts on NATO, they now look and they say, you know, Trump is right.
You gave an interview...
These are people that study it.
You gave an interview to USA Today. You talked about, you know, you're looking at possible vice presidential picks. You're obviously not going to give out any names, but you did say you would like -- you name Marco Rubio, you name John Kasich. You even named Scott Walker.
No, I said they're people I like.
Right.
Here's the problem. I've beaten them very, very harshly. I mean, you know, Walker was supposed to win. And, you know, right after I started on him, he went back to Wisconsin, OK?
And he endorsed Senator Cruz.
And doesn't -- of course he did. I didn't even ask him for an endorsement. How could I ask him for an endorsement? Because I was the one that got him out. Jeb Bush, the same thing. Marco, the same thing. I mean, I think they're nice people, but I can't imagine they like me too much.
But when you say you like them -- so when you say you like them, were you saying you like them as potential vice presidents or...
I like them as people. I like them as people. Now, could they be involved in some form in the government? Yeah, absolutely I think they could. I don't necessarily think for a vice president.
It's interesting, because they are all sort of, you know, you could argue establishment-type candidates. Is that -- whoever you would pick for a vice president, we've talked about this before, is that what you would look for, somebody who -- with political experience on the ground in Washington, essentially a Washington player who can help you with Congress?
Yes. Yes.
Without a doubt?
I'm a business guy. We're going to make great deals on trade. We're going to do -- it's right in my wheelhouse. It's so easy for me. We're going have a really strong military. We're going to rebuild our military. We're going to take care of health care. I'm going to do so well with so many different things. But I do want -- you don't need two like me. I want to have somebody that can deal with Congress, that gets along with Congress. That's a Washington person.
Peggy was saying that she worked for your dad. What was your relationship like with your dad?
It was great. It really became much better when I hit about 20, when I graduated from the Wharton School of Finance, and I started working. But, I worked with him during summers, but it was a great relationship.
You've still talked about kind of changing your tone from time to time, maybe even soon. Do you think that's actually going to happen? Because a lot of people are saying, look, you've been talking about that for a while.
Sure.
Maybe he's not actually capable of changing.
Oh, I'm very capable of doing it. It's easy to do it. I mean, it's easier to do it than the way I behave right now. But you have to.
It kind of makes him the person he is, honestly. It's so great to not see the sound bites, the traditional politician sound bites that you read too often. I mean, he's so authentic. He writes the tweets himself. He doesn't have a team of hundreds and hundreds of people behind him. And I think that's actually what makes him the great candidate that he is.
And more importantly the retweets.
It's actually they're not vetted.
The retweets get me in trouble. It's not the tweets.
The retweets get you in trouble.
The tweets are fine. The retweets sometimes get a little bit shaky.
As president, though...
No, I wouldn't be doing it.
You wouldn't?
Or I would do it very little. It's different. But right now, if I'm fighting one of my opponents, I can tweet out things, or my feelings. And I had it in CNN. I mean, there was one instance where I was at a town hall and somebody got up and made a pretty negative statement about the president. You probably remember, very negative. They never found out who this guy was. I don't know, was he a setup or what? I think you know what I'm talking about.
Do you write all your own tweets?
I would say yes.
And when somebody retweets from your account, you've retweeted?
I would say yes, other than if we release some information. I have some people, Dan, and some other people that will do it. But...
Do you actually sit there and type or do you say something and somebody else types it?
During the day, I'm in the office, I just shout it out to one of the young ladies who are tremendous. I have tremendous office staff. And Meredith and some of the people that work for me. And I'll just shout it out, and they'll do it. But during the evenings, after 7 o'clock or so, I will always do it by myself.
Hi. You definitely got my vote.
Oh, good. That was good. That's good. Thank you.
Well, first of all, Mr. Trump, I respect you tremendously as a businessman but more importantly as a father. And you've swayed me tonight, first of all.
Oh great, good, thank you.
Hi. I just want to congratulate all of you for the success that you've had. And I'm definitely voting for you, Mr. Trump.
Thank you very much, appreciate it.
We know you lost your older brother from alcoholism at age 43, I lost an older sister from alcoholism at age 37. And I know what a -- you know, it's a life-changing event and you really have to take stock in your life.
right.
My question is, how did you -- we've seen so many -- you know, the children of so many wealthy people who have -- you know, they've ended up being a mess. How did you instill with your kids -- how did you protect them, how did you instill a sense of personal responsibility with them? And what advice would you give for parents whose children may be struggling with addiction?
Well, it's such an important question and a great question. I had a brother who was a fantastic guy. I talked about this to Anderson once because you had some difficulty...
I mean, it was -- as young children it often was accompanied by one of us eye-rolling. But, you know, I think in retrospect as parents we see how much that was an important message.
She used to say, daddy, don't say that anymore, don't say that. But I just felt it was important because I've seen so many brilliant young children of wonderful parents destroyed because they drank or they took drugs.
Is business life tougher or political life?
Well, I think that political life is more dishonest. I mean, I find the people in politics to be far more dishonest than pretty dishonest businesspeople, you want to know the truth. I deal with some pretty tough customers. I think the businesspeople are tougher. I think the businesspeople that -- I mean, I know them all. We'll use some of these tough people to renegotiate our trade deals, folks. Believe me. I know the good ones, and I know the bad ones, and I know the overrated ones, and I know the ones that are the best of all that nobody ever heard of. But we will use the best. We don't use the best right now. But I will say this. I think that businesspeople are tougher, but I think the politicians are more deceptive.
And you know, though, how politics works. At the convention, if you don't make it in the first round of voting, a lot of those delegates who have to vote for you in the first round, they're free to go elsewhere.
Well, I'm not an establishment...
Are you ready for that?
Sure, I'm ready for it. Look, my life would be a lot easier. I have some wonderful things. My life would be a lot easier. I just want to do something. The country -- as my children have said, the country has been great to me and I want to give back. And, you know, if people want me to do that, I think I'll do a fantastic job for them and we'll bring the country back. And we'll save Social Security and we'll save Medicare. All this -- I mean, our country is in such trouble. People don't realize what trouble. We're sitting on a bubble. Our country is in tremendous trouble. So I think I'd do a really good job.
Wow! Good to see you. How are you?
Very good. Thank you.
You've got to be happy. You are -- New York is next. In the last two polls, you were at 60 and 61 percent.
Right.
I want to especially talk -- you know, Pittsburgh went through a very tough economic transition, and they're coming out on the other side of it because of the people in this room, in part. I want to ask you first, though, about Colorado in particular.
Right.
There are 70-some-odd delegates...
... are appointed.
... and you actually end up voting for the delegate, not Donald Trump...
That's right.
Let me ask this. Look, politics, we always like to say, is a blood sport.
Yes.
... and my -- and my fear is...
I have a feeling that name is going to be sticking with him.
Have you thought of a nickname for her yet?
I have, actually. I'll release it on one of your next shows, but I don't want to do it.
But you do have a name picked out for Hillary?
Well, you know, I'd like to use "lying, " but we already used it for Ted. We don't want to use it twice.
Oh.
No, I have -- I actually have, I think, a pretty good name. You know, I've come up with some pretty good names during this campaign. And we have a pretty good one, I think, but we'll try it out here first in about a month. Is that OK?
You're going to give a -- you're going give a series of speeches, though.
I am.
You gave a speech at AIPAC. You're giving a series of real serious...
Policy speeches...
And about 10 of them...
I'm going to give about...
... with a teleprompter, serious, well written...
Serious, well-written, written by me...
But I guess where the -- I guess it's a razor's edge in some ways because you're saying you're going to negotiate free and fair deals. But OK, let's say we limit some of the imports from China, Vietnam, depending on what the product happens to be. That also means American consumers are going to end up paying more.
Well, no...
Hang on. So let me ask you...
But Sean, watch -- watch this. Wait. Watch this. Are you guys ready for it? Who's going to pay for the wall?
Mexico!
And by the way -- by the way, 100 percent. You know, the politicians say they'll never pay -- 100 percent!
And let me -- let me go back to getting...
Sean?
How long would it take you...
... because it's to their advantage.
Yes.
And they endorsed me because they know -- you know, they want to do their job. When you let them do their job and when you put pressure on Mexico to stop what's going on -- you're going to need the wall. You're going to always want the wall. But you know what? It will not be nearly as necessary as it is right now.
Do you think -- let me go back to this side. If you become president, it's your first day in office -- I hate the fact that we rely on countries that hate our guts for energy, which is the lifeblood of our economy.
True.
Yes.
I love solar. Solar's great. The problem is, it's a 30-year payback! You know, you -- it isn't...
Practical.
It's, like, weak. It's not there yet. It's a 30 -- somebody said, Oh, it's really wonderful, 32-year payback. Who's going to get 32-year payback? And it doesn't have big power.
OK.
... she really was.
Hillary Clinton, in almost every poll about two-thirds of Americans believe she's dishonest, untrustworthy. She has a 55 percent unfavorable.
You know the big -- I really think she's got a lot of --
And if they hit back, is everything on the table?
Yes. I don't care. I mean, to me it doesn't matter.
That's the way it should be?
You know, when I won Florida, there were 38,000 negative ads. Can you believe it? I had this big tournament at Doral where the great Adam Scott, player from Australia, he's winning. And before they gave him the trophy, they did four negative commercials on me. I said, turn the televisions off. They were all over the place. That was my tournament at Doral. It was the world championship. The Cadillac World Championship.
Take the oil and let them pay --
I said take the oil. I said take the oil. I wrote about Osama bin Laden, I wrote about Osama bin Laden in a book that was published two years before the World Trade Center --
And you talked about Brussels ahead of time, in January.
The New York Times,  they kill me. I talked about Brussels. I said five months ago Brussels is a hellhole. And The New York Times did a major story, what right do I have to say that, and then they had the problem. I was right.
Do you think --
We're not taking their wealth away. We're not bombing the oil. We're sending leaflets down, in an hour we may be bombing your truck. Please remove yourself form -- we are -- we don't know what we're doing.
And I want to know, is this generational, or can we actually win that war?
I think you can win it, but you'll have to be very tough. You've got to be really smart.
And you're prepared to fight that to the end?
You know what, this is not like fighting Germany. This is not like fighting these countries that we were able to beat. This is 35,000 people, and they laugh at us, at our stupidity. They can't believe it. Think of it, it's true. When we bomb, we send leaflets down. We're going to be bombing your truck. And this is true -- they don't want to bomb some oil because they don't want to create environmental impact. Do you know that?
We tell our military, we literally tied their hands. They have rules of engagement that they can't shoot and fire even if fired upon.
So Hillary goes in to Libya, and you have the Benghazi problem, you have all the things. But she goes in. Now, who has Libya, who has it? ISIS has it. And they have great oil. And do you know what happens with the oil? We don't do anything about it, we don't create a blockade. We don't do anything.
Now for the top story tonight. Let's bring in Donald Trump who joins us from Indianapolis. So, am I making any mistakes in my Talking Points, Mr. Trump?
Well, I don't know why you are so surprised. I mean, you know, we have been doing well. I have done well my whole life. I have had victories my whole life. So, we are going to have another victory. We have thousands of people -- we are in Indiana. We have thousands of people behind me. You probably hear. It's been amazing. And last night was so incredible in New York.
All right. But you have got to step back and you have to -- and I know you are. I mean, you know. This is -- what have you accomplished here has never really been done before in this country. I mean, you, a political outsider, with no legislative experience, wipe out 17 experienced, most of them politicians, Ben Carson the exception, wipe them out. And you are saying that I shouldn't be surprised and the folks shouldn't be surprised? Come on, you're surprised.
Well, I wouldn't say I'm surprised, Bill. You know, it's about jobs. It's about the economy. It's about a strong military. It's about the border.
You aren't surprised that you are going to be the nominee? When you started out, I know you are a confident guy. I know that. But you must have said, you know, this is kind of a long shot but I'm going to do it anyway because I believe in myself?
Well, you know, my message is make America great again. I think it's been a great message from the beginning. From the moment I announced on June 16th, it was, you know, pretty well accepted. And right after that shortly a few weeks after that we went to number one and I've stayed there for that entire period of time up until now. We have been center stage on every debate as you know.
Yes.
You know, meaning like number one in every debate.
All right.
And I don't know. But I love the process. I love the people. I have seen so many people. So many millions of people. And this country is great. We have such potential, Bill. And we're not using it. With that being said, you know, my opponents. As you know because you reported it. I have had 55,000 negative ads. Fifty five thousand negative ads. And I won Florida after --
They don't care. Your supporters don't care. They don't care.
Yes.
OK. Now, last night you shocked the world by calling Ted Cruz senator rather than the usual Lyin' Ted. Was that a signal that you are the kinder, gentler Trump now?
Look, I don't think so necessarily. I thought it would be very undignified for me to get up at that particular moment with all of the people and, you know, pretty much the world watching last night because everybody wanted to see what was going to happen in the great State of New York. A state where I think I will beat Hillary Clinton by the way. But what was going to happen, and even I didn't know it was going to be that, you know, it's close to 62 percent. And even I didn't know it was going to be to that level. We got almost all of the delegates, almost 100 percent of the delegates. It's going to be very --
Yes. I think you lost three to Kasich. I think that's the final tally.
I think, yes, we have a lot of them.
But you were not bombastic last night. You were happy. Very complementary to your home state.
True.
And it was a little bit of a different thing. And now, as I said, they can't stop you, they being Mitch McConnell and the Republican establishment they can't. They can't. In my opinion, and I have looked at every scenario is nothing -- unless you get whacked in California and the field poll says that you are running OK there unless you get wiped out there, you are in. You are the guy.
Yes. We are doing very well in California. We have a tremendous lead and I have a tremendous relationship with that state. I employ many people there and, you know, I really have a great relationship with California. And we're going out there in a few weeks. And I think, you know, we will do very well there. But I have to say that I don't know why the Republican Party in terms of its leaders, I like Mitch and I like Paul Ryan and I don't know why turn away the millions and millions of voters that came -- you know, they call it the Trump train. I don't call it the Trump train because it's, you know --
I will tell you why. Do you want to know why? Do you want to know?
Go ahead.
They don't think that you are going to beat her, Hillary Clinton. And they think they are going to lose the Senate and the House in the process. They think it's going to be a Goldwater 1964 run. That's what they think. Now, what they base that on, I don't know. I mean, that's what they think.
Yes. Yes. A lot of people think I will beat her. A lot of people think I will put states into play that will never be in play like I will win Michigan. No other Republican is going to even compete in Michigan, I'll win Pennsylvania. I will win states that nobody else and guess what, I am going to win New York.
If you win New York, you're going to be president. If you win New York, you're going to be president.
But I will win New York.
That is what I'm saying.
Because I'm going to produce -- Bill, I'm going to producer jobs. I look at New York State. It's a disaster. The jobs are all gone. I mean, they are moving to Mexico. They are moving all over the world.
Certainly Upstate --
New York state is just -- no -- and I will tell you, I think I will win New York.
All right.
And that would be a --
So, can hang on for just a couple minutes? I want to talk to you about Hillary Clinton and I'm sure you are thinking about, this how you are going to go and compete one-on-one with her. And we appreciate your time. We know you are running around the country today.
Sure.
All right. So that's the theme Crooked Hillary Clinton. You can't let it happen. Are you going to get out on a hat?
Well, it's not a theme, Bill. It's a nickname that I use. I like to sort of brand people. Brand them honestly. And I branded some of the people that I have been against on the Republican side. I think it's been effective and, you know, that's what I brand her. I mean, you know, the story as well as anybody else. She has a lot of problems.
OK. So, it's not going to be the kinder, gentler Donald Trump in the one-on-one race. Do you believe that when you go after Hillary Clinton and let me ask you this. You know, the Clintons have had some personal situations based on the President's conducts in the White House. Are you going to dredge all that up? Is that going to become forefront?
I hope not. I don't look to. I certainly would like to keep that out if possible. You just don't know what's going to happen. But I would like to be able to keep that out if possible.
All right. So if they don't come after you personally, you are not going to come after them personally? Can we get that on the record tonight?
I would say that but, you know, when you say I will be tough with her, she is going to be -- and they are going to be very tough with me. You know, I have been reading, oh, they are doing all sorts of research and everything else. What's there to find? People have known me for a long time. But, they are going in to all sorts of different things and, you know, I am what I am. And I have done well. I have built a great, great company. I filed my papers for the great company. Everybody can see it. I built an amazing company. And, frankly, with some of the great assets of the world, very little leverage, very little debt, tremendous cash flow, some the great assets of the world, Bill. And, you know, I'm very proud of it.
Yes.
Over $10 billion in net worth. You know what, Bill?
But so will she. But here's what likely to happen.
I know that. I mean, they're going to be tough. They're going to be tough.
She has got some nasty, nasty pieces of work on her payroll. And they don't work directly for her. They work for the PACs. The Political Action Committees. These are the worst, these guys. I'm not going to mention their names. And I don't want to empower them. You know who they are. All right?
I know their names.
They're going to do it? They're going to come after you --
I have known it for 20 years, Bill.
Right.
Sure.
So, when they come after you leaking stuff to a Huffington Post or a left wing website or even a legitimate paper, OK? When they do that, are you going to then come back in kind and drag up all the Lewinski stuff?
There will be retaliation unless it's fair. If it's fair I would never do that. But there will be retaliation as there should be unless it's fair. Now, if they treat me fairly, I'm going to treat them fairly.
Well, they're not going to treat you fairly. You are not going to treat them fairly.
Well, we will find out. We will find out.
She said last night that you are dangerous. You are a dangerous man. That seems to be the theme. Your theme is that she is corrupt. Her theme is you're dangerous. That seems to me where it's going right now. Now, that's not fair. You don't think you are dangerous, do you?
No, I don't. I think that I'm going to put the country back to work again. I think I'm going to build our military strong.
When she goes off and says Donald Trump is dangerous and he is denigrating women and he is doing all things to minorities and he doesn't like Muslims, it's dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, is that enough to set you back where you go after her personally?
Well, they would be lies. I mean, if they said those things, they would be lies because that's not true and I think you understand that. So maybe it would be. We'll have to see. I watched Bernie and Bernie got angrier and angrier as this campaign went by. I see him winning all these different states. You know it's a corrupt system. You understand that better than anybody.
Yes. I got that. But Bernie didn't lay her out. Bernie stayed away from all of the email stuff.
Yes. He got nasty.
He was hitting her on the donations. But, Bernie gave her a pass on 90 percent of the other historical stuff. And I just see this --
He made a big mistake by not doing the emails. He made a big mistake and not really going after her. When he did that little sound bite basically saying forget the emails --
Yes.
That was a big mistake and he wished he had that to go over again and especially right now.
So, you are not going to forget the emails. You are not going to forget the emails. All right. Last question.
Well, I think the emails -- I don't think that's playing dirty pool. I think the emails are a big part of her life story right now. What she did was terrible.
Depends on the FBI.
We're going to see what happens.
Do you want to make a prediction tonight? Do you think Hillary Clinton will be indicted?
No. Because I think the Democrat Party is going to protect her. I don't think she is going to be indicted. I think that what she has done is very, very serious. I know for a fact that what General Petraeus and others have done was much less, and it destroyed their lives. So I do believe, Bill, that she is being protected.
But how can the Democratic Party protect her from the FBI? Isn't the FBI non-corruptible?
Well, I hope they are not working together. You know, they are humans. And they are people and they do talk, I would imagine. And I would like to think that they don't work together. But I would say that she is being protected. Now, what she can't be protected from is the statute of limitations because on the assumption that somebody else got in, that's a real dangerous situation.
So, if you were elected, then you would go back in and take a look at it?
Well, you have a six year statute of limitations.
Right.
And certainly this folds within that period of time. And you certainly have to look at it, very fairly. I would only do something if it was 100 percent fair. But certainly that is something that you would look at.
Mr. Trump, thank you very much for your time this evening. We know how busy you are. We will talk to you again soon.
Thank you, Bill.
So another person at Fortune reached out as part of that article.
I never heard about.
What makes a businessman great?
Proper instinct -- so important. Knowing the limits that they can go. Imagination, so important.
Do the things that make a businessman great make a president great?
They help -- but it's another step. You have to have a lot of different skills in addition to those of a businessman. You need great communication skills, which a businessman does not need. I have friends of mine who are tremendously successful but they don't communicate well. But they have other assets. You do need a lot of heart; businessmen don't necessarily need heart.
One difference between running a business and running a company: You said you currently have very little leverage. But over your career you have used leverage on your buildings.
I have had it both ways. I like this way better.
You made a lot of money off of the gaming license of the Marina. You had a license and Hilton didn't.
What happened was that Hilton was unable to get licensed because they used lawyers that were I guess inappropriate according to gaming commissions, even though those same lawyers were used by people who had licenses. I think Hilton wasn't well represented. But Hilton was not treated fairly in Atlantic City in my opinion. They were forced to sell Marina at a firesale. I got it for $400 million. I got 100% of financing by Manufacturers Hanover Trust, the head of whom was a great guy -- John McGillicutty. I said to John, give me 100% of the financing. But I also said when junk bond market comes around I'll finance it out. I financed it out, I had no money -- I bought it for nothing. Same thing with the (Trump) Plaza (casino), even better than that because I was in for so little money because Holiday Inn had put up all the money, and then Holiday Inn had the big problem and I was able to buy them out for very little money. So there's my foray into Atlantic City.
The thing I think people struggle with about your time in Atlantic City is that when your company went public in 1994 --
No, no. I hadn't taken it public yet.
You hadn't taken it public yet?
No, I'm not public yet. I then refinanced, like you would do your house, but with junk bonds to take money out. And ultimately I took it public and took money out. After it was public I was not very involved. Here's the problem with AC: The politicians years ago made terrible decisions. They built a convention center in the wrong location. It was too far away from the hotels. I said, "You are making a terrible mistake." Then they built the airport and they did a terrible job, and I said "Folks, essentially mentally I'm going to go onto other things," and I did. I went to Manhattan projects that were very successful.
But --
Let me tell you. Just so you know. Atlantic City was phenomenal for me.
Right. But so --
Nobody knows it.
But let me say --
Except for the smart people.
Perhaps people struggle with your description of how you did in Atlantic City because when the finances were public, the company never made any money. And after the company went public, the stock went up a little bit to $45, but then pretty much dove straight down to zero and into the bankruptcy.
But just so you know, if you look at Atlantic City now, 75% of all the casinos in Atlantic City have gone bankrupt, or are in big trouble. And Caesars is bankrupt. They are all bankrupt. It's a disaster. I got out seven years ago. My timing was incredible. I get a lot of credit for that.
But your casino company starting turning down years before the mass problems started for Atlantic City. The public numbers --
Because what happened is the bond holders came to me and said why don't you put on debt. And I said, 'Let me look at it,' and they offered me so much debt, and I said, 'This is too much debt for the company.' Then they wanted me to take it public. All of those things were good as an individual, but I said to them (his bankers) 'Will it be a good thing or bad thing for people?' And they said to me, 'Oh, no, the market is going to grow. Everything is going to grow.' I said, 'Well what happens if gaming happens in Pennsylvania. You have 30% of Atlantic City's market comes from Pennsylvania.' And they all said, 'It won't affect the Atlantic City market.' I said, 'I think it will.' I was right. But by that time, I had largely left Atlantic City. I wasn't involved very much with Atlantic City. But I called it. What killed Atlantic City, beside the bad decision making from the politicians, was gaming in Pennsylvania. And I was able to say that that was going to happen. The point is that Atlantic City for me as an individual was a very good thing.
What percentage?
It depends on how aggressive you want to be. I'd rather not be so aggressive. Don't forget: We have to rebuild the infrastructure of our country. We have to rebuild our military, which is being decimated by bad decisions. We have to do a lot of things. We have to reduce our debt, and the best thing we have going now is that interest rates are so low that lots of good things can be done that aren't being done, amazingly.
So you like the fact that interest rates are low? Some of the candidates have said that's wrong. Do you think interest rates should be as low as they are?
I always like low interest rates, certainly as a developer. The problem with low interest rates is it's unfair that people who've led the American way of life -- the true American way of life -- that have saved every penny, that have paid off their mortgages, that have done everything they were supposed to do, and they were going to retire with their beautiful nest egg, and they were going to get interest on their money, and now they're getting one-eighth of 1%. I think that's unfair to those people, who have led their lives in the way they were supposed to.
Should the Fed be raising interest rates? Has the Fed and Janet Yellen done a good job?
People think the Fed should be raising rates. What's a scary prospect is if you start raising rates and you have to borrow money as a country, and if the rates, instead of where they are now, the rates are substantially higher, where the rates are 3% and 4%, or whatever it may end up being. That is a very scary prospect for this country. When you start adding that kind of number to an already reasonably crippled economy, certainly in terms of what we produce, that number is a very scary number for a lot of people to be looking at. And if you notice they don't look at it. Because they want to keep interest rates down. A frightening scenario is that interest rates go up and we have to refinance the debt at higher rates, as apposed to paying very little like we are now.
Do you think Janet Yellen is doing a good job?
I think she's doing a serviceable job. But you never know if they're doing a good job until about five years after they leave office.
Would you reappoint her?
I don't want to comment on reappointments. I would be more inclined to put other people in.
Are you for the audit the Fed movement, that the Congress would be able to audit the Fed's decisions?
Yes. Totally.
A lot of business people do believe having debt is a good thing. Higher leverage leads to higher returnns. And you have talked about wiping out the debt. Why is it bad for the U.S. to have debt?
Oh, I would rather not have debt. But we are stuck with it. If I had a choice of taking over debt free or having $19 trillion dollars -- which, by the way, is going up to $21 trillion soon, because of the omnibus budget, which is a disaster -- I'll take no debt every time. I can look at myself. I have lived a life where I have a lot of debt and like now I have very, very little debt and I'll tell you it's more pleasant with very little debt.
But you may take over this country where some people think we have a lot of debt.
No, where everybody thinks -- every sane person thinks we have a lot of debt.
Some people have called you a bully. Are you?
I don't think so at all, no.
But you've also talked about your tough negotiating skills?
I don't talk about them. Other people talk about them. I don't say that I am tough. I say that I know how to negotiate. I'm a smart person. I look at the deals our country has made. This Iran deal is one of the worst negotiations I've ever seen of any kind. Our trade deals are horrendous. Carl Icahn endorsed me. Many other people endorsed me. Great business people endorsed me. I would use our great businesspeople to negotiate those deals. Right now we have political hacks doing it. And they are negotiating the biggest deals in the world. Deals with China and Japan. And deals with Mexico. We have people who don't have any ability, who don't have business instinct negotiating these deals. I would use the best business minds, and we have the best in the world. I would use our best people to negotiate those deals, many of which have endorsed me.
The hard business tactics, the tough negotiations, the brinksmanship in hostile M&A deals for instance, that happen in business, would that work in politics. As an example, you have said that you would impose 45% tariffs on China. Is that what you really want or is that an negotiating tactic?
First of all I never said that. I made a statement to the New York Times to the editorial board. And that was not said. Something different was said. I would talk to China and probably be able to get them to do what to do what they should be doing. China has zero respect for our country. They have zero respect for our president and our leadership. I would tell China that the devaluation (of the Chinese yuan) is destroying our businesses. We are losing tremendous amounts of business. Not only China. You look at what Japan is doing with the yen. You look at what others countries are doing with the devaluation and manipulation of their currencies. Something of which our leaders have no idea what's happening. And they are systematically. I just left upstate New York, You look at Pennsylvania and Indiana where carrier just left for Mexico. I would tell China that either you start playing by the rules, or we will be imposing tariffs on your products coming in. That doesn't mean I am doing it, because in my opinion if they believe it they are going to play by the rules. But they have to believe it.
But does tough negotiations like that, where you are risking a trade war with China, does that work?
What's a trade war? How are we losing? We already have hundreds of billions of dollars of trade deficit. So we have massive trade deficit with China.
Similar, saying we will pull out of NATO, is that a negotiating tactic. And if so, does that work?
I never said we were going to pull out of NATO. You have 28 countries in NATO, it's 68 years old. It's obsolete. Right now we have to be focusing on terror. It was set up for the Soviet Union. Russia's still a problem, but Russia is not the Soviet Union. NATO is obsolete and the problem is we're carrying NATO. You have many countries, known fact, that can afford to but they have decided not to pay their way. We're protecting countries within NATO and they're not paying their way. And I've said, they have to pay their way. If they don't pay way their way, we're not going to be protecting them. They will pay their way if said to them in the right manner. That's not said in a touch manner or a soft manner. It's just said. They owe us a great deal of money from delinquencies and past payments that haven't been made. In many cases, the only reason they haven't made 'em in many cases is they have no respect for our country. They have no respect for our leadership. But many of the NATO countries are not carrying their weight. This is a known fact. When I said NATO is obsolete and when I said the second part about not carrying their weight financially, at first there was an uproar and then if you notice a lot of people are saying, 'You know, Trump is right,' and I've gotten a lot of credit for saying it.
There's been reported times in your career where you have turned down deals that would take your name off buildings. The example is the Marina with the Rank Group. They wanted to make it the Hard Rock Cafe Casino, and you wanted it the Hard Rock Cafe Casino by Trump. It was reported that the negotiations broke down over the fact that you weren't willing to take your name off the casino.
That's false. I know nothing about the Rank Group. I don't even know what you are talking about.
But you know you were in negotiations to sell Marina to the group that owned the Hard Rock Cafe.
Well, not really because by that time I was pretty much out --
No, this was well before (you got out of Atlantic City), even before you changed the name to the Trump Marina. There was a deal to change then Trump's Castle to the Hard Rock Cafe?
It was a long time ago, I really don't remember.
OK. It was widely reported that you walked away from the deal. But there have been other times where negotiations have broken down because your name wouldn't be on the project.
I would like you to name one.
That one.
You mean in all of these years, you are bringing up one deal that didn't go anywhere, I guess, because I don't even know about the deal. So out of all these years and all of these hundreds of buildings you bringing up one deal, and that's the only deal you can think of.
Well that one was well reported.
I know nothing about it. The name wasn't change. Ultimately, seven years ago, I left Atlantic City, and my timing was, as they say, incredible.
So as a business man you have made the deals that were the best ones for you. As president of the United States how do you transition to putting the people of the country first and not Mr. Trump. How should people know you'll do that?
The country will always be first. I built a great company. You don't know anything about my company. I built a company that is worth a tremendous amount of money, has a tremendous amount of cashflow -- its a never ending cashflow. But it is a business that is very unimportant to me if I won the presidency. My executives and my children will run the co and they'll run it well. It's not a hard company to run. We are dealing now with over 121 deals world wide for licensing. Tell him about the hotels, Eric.
You're so good at being a real estate developer, and running hotels, and buying properties. Why haven't you stuck to that over your career? Why get into the airplane business, or do the steaks, or all the others stuff?
You are right. But I make a lot of money. Like the water company, I make a lot of money with the water company. But more importantly I supply water to all my facilities. Steaks and all of this. It's just auxiliary. It's simple, but it works well with my company.
Do you know what you don't do as well as other things? Do you know where you are not as strong as in other areas?
No. I think I'm good in areas where I want to focus. In my life, where I want to do something I've done it well. I started this company with one million loan, and the company is worth much more than $10 billion right now.
As president, do you think you will know what you don't do as well to other things, and will get advisors, and lean on them?
Totally. I believe in getting great people and getting people who are the absolute best. As an examples for negotiating trade deals, some of the people who you interview are the right people to get. But unfortunately, we don't use in many cases those people. We use people with absolutely no ability. When China comes at us, they come with groups of 20 and everyone one of those people is trained to take every penny out of the United States that you can take.
How you lined up people to be your advisors in different areas?
I have a lot of people who've supported me -- people like Carl Icahn and others.
Anyone you can name besides Carl Icahn?
Numerous. I am going to put out a list in the next three or four weeks. We have tremendous endorsements from the business community.
Have you made a decision of who you would lean on for economic policy?
I have made the decision but I haven't, no -- there's not one person. When it comes to economic policy I would listen to many people and ultimately make a decision. But there's not one person.
Eventually, you will have to pick someone to be the Defense Secretary, and the Secretary of the Treasury.
Sure. I'm a big believer in talent and a big believer in getting the absolute best talent. We will have the best talent ever to run this country, that I can tell you. It's a very important thing. It's ultimately one of the most important thing.
On the tariffs that you have brought up between China and Mexico. Mark Zandi, an economist at Moody's Economy.com, has run your proposal through his model and said that it would cost us as many as 8 million jobs.
It's not going to cost us jobs. It's going to bring jobs back. China charges us tariffs. We don't charge. And anything we do is very minor by comparison. Ok. Give me one more question. Let's go.
If you get to the convention and you don't have enough delegates and it looks like there are moves to deny you the nomination, how far do you plan to go. What is your strategy?
I have a strong strategy to get the 1,237. I think we will. We are on track to do it. A lot will depend on tonight (the New York primary). We should have a good victory tonight, and we will see what happens.
What happens if you get to the convention and you don't have the delegates?
I can only see what happens. Many different circumstances could cause things to go both good and bad.
You used to have a catch phrase on the show (The Apprentice), "You're fired." Right?
I also have a catch phrase, "Make American Great Again."
You do. But before that you were known for that other catch phrase. Have you fired anyone in this campaign?
Essentially, no.
Why not? Isn't that part of being a good manager? Culling talent?
I started off with a small group of people. Most people said he'll never run. OK. I'm now by far the leading Republican candidate. I'm leading by more than 200 delegates and more than 2 million votes. I'm very happy with my people. Now we're evolving into a larger operation because it's become a very large campaign. I started off with just a few people. Other people started off with hundreds and they're gone. You look at the kind of money that was squandered and waisted. I spent less than virtually every other candidate and I am in first place. That's what the American people like.
What's dirtier: Business or politics?
Politics.
If you get the nomination, would you self fund in the general election?
I haven't made a determination of that yet. Haven't really looked at it yet. I am totally self funding my primary campaign. I have not made that determination.
You have a high unfavorable rating for a front runner. Do you have a plan to re-brand the Mr. Trump brand in the minds of voters.
I'm not going to rebrand.
You don't have a computer in here, in your office? Do you use a computer?
Yes. I do. They bring one in.
Do you text mostly from your phone?
Sometimes from my phone. Why do you ask these questions?
Just curious.
You don't stop. Do you?
People have said that you have similar supporters to Bernie Sanders. You tap into the same type of frustration that people have. Do you have a plan to appeal to Bernie's supporters?
One thing we have in common is trade. We both know the U.S. is getting ripped off by trade. The difference is I can do something about it and he can't. Ok. Thanks.
Thank you.
Good job, Steve.
It is a private club sort of.
It is, but if you think about it, you can buy the presidency. You take $100 million, you put it aside. You allocate it to delegates, and you've just become president of the United States, and you can lose elections. Like I won for nine months, you know. I won Louisiana. I said, wait a minute, why do I have less delegates than these guys? That's how it started. But they had been working on it for seven, eight months. It's a corrupt system.
One of the things we want to look at as we look at the whole span of your life is the origins of your interest in running for office. And if you go back through the magazines and the newspapers, it's talked about as early as the early 1980s.
Early 19 -- well, I will say -.
But if you think back earlier, when you were a kid, did you think I want to run for office, I want to run for president?
Probably not, and it's hard to think of terms of that because on television every once in a while I see a kid, ah, I want to be president. I guess everybody wants to be president I see children on television and children you speak to, oh, I want to be president. So in one way, maybe they do. Maybe I did. But the time I really thought of it, seriously thought of it was four years ago, and it wouldn't have been good timing for me because I was doing so many different jobs.
True.
OK.
So we're going back to the very beginning, and even as far as back as -.
So let me ask you one thing, though. So I've had a lot of very inaccurate stories written about me in the Washington Post. And one story that really bothered me greatly because it's just totally untrue. You had this real wise-ass call up, and I'm a good golfer. I've won many club championships, right, and I'm not a cheater. And he said I cheat in golf. Do you know what I'm talking about?
Thirty years.
Wow. So you've seen it, and now you have at least the financial backing that you can do. How's it doing now, would you say?
Well, with Bezos it's doing extremely well. He's investing in the newsroom. He's brought us almost back to the peak level that we were at before all the cuts.
Because he's got the money.
He's got the money.
So it doesn't matter if it makes money.
It looks like he's treating it like Amazon. He's worrying about market share.
Right. And is the market share growing actually?
Enormously. We passed the Times in online traffic a couple of months back.
Really? And the Times is just treading water, right? I see it.
Tim O'Brien.
A real lowlife. He comes into my office, and he wrote a totally false piece. And you know what? In retrospect it's not a big deal. But he said I was worth $200 million or $250 million. I said, how do you figure that? He said, this building is worth much more than that, and I have but he said, but you don't own the land. I said, well, actually, we do. And we had a very young lawyer, a very attractive young lawyer, who he found very attractive. Yeah?
Hi.
Hi, honey.
How's it going?
This is Ivanka.
How are you?
These folks are from the Washington Post.
I'm heading to Doral.
Good, sweetheart.
Yeah.
Good. Call me and let me know, OK?
Yeah, it'll be -.
Yeah. We bought it three and a half, four years ago. It's phenomenal. Mostly we own, all the licensing deals are better. No investment. But we're doing good, right?
A hundred and fifty million.
We're working on 121 deals all around the country.
Wow.
A hundred and twenty-one deals. It's really amazing. Have a good time, baby. Let me know how it goes.
See you later.
I just use him as an example. There was another one, Wayne Barrett, a real lowlife. This guy O'Brien comes up to the office. I don't know O'Brien. He comes up to the office. The lawyer was very attractive, and he starts hitting on her -.
Like with Bonwit Teller, right, going way back. You knew you were going to beat up about that.
I knew, but I had to take the building down. And one of the things I had to do, they were going to landmark the building, something nobody knows. They were going to landmark the building, and I had to have a fast demolition or this building wouldn't be here. I was building, there was big wave of landmarking after Penn Station, etcetera, etcetera. And it wasn't a building worthy to be landmarked or I would've, but if I didn't move quickly that building would've been landmarked. I'm a very political person actually, but there was a big move on to landmark the Bonwit Teller building. If I didn't have those guys working around the clock taking this down, and they started literally on a weekend, they would've landmarked that building. So the first time I think I've ever said that. So does it make sense what I said?
Sure.
If they landmark the building, you're stuck with that building for the rest of your life. Good luck. And we don't have a 68-story building on the site. So when I heard, when I got word from a very good friend of mine, who I still see, who I still every once in a while thank him, but I did take a lot of publicity because I ripped the hell out of the place. I didn't have time to save anything.
The frieze and all that.
Well, we had that knocked down. We had no choice. And then the following week they came over from Landmarks, and they said, wow, look at this, they're demolishing the building. And that was the end of that. So that's a story that you can tell 30 years later, but you can't tell then. Do you want something to drink, by the way, folks? Water, anything?
Sure, water, please.
Water? Do you want a water?
Sure.
OK. Two waters and a Coke.
So we're going way back to the beginning -.
So let me ask you about the book. So is this just a compilation of stories or something?
Do you want to explain? if we know a year, year in a half in advance who's going to be the candidate -.
Right.
-- we can take the time and do a series of stories that then get turned into a book. We didn't have the time this time because we didn't know who was going to win. You may have known, but we didn't. So we started late. We've taken a whole bunch of reporters -.
When will the book come out? Do you have any idea?
August 23rd, so -.
So if it's a bad book it would be very detrimental to me. It shouldn't be a bad book.
Well, but you will see everything before that because the way we're doing it, we're working on the stories at the same time. The stories will appear piecemeal in the paper over the following weeks before the book even comes out.
Oh, so you're doing them as stories. Will you be writing the stories? Will both of you be writing?
Yeah. So have maybe 15 reporters who will be covering you in certain ways, other reporters who otherwise wouldn't have been involved. So they'll be working on turned into newspaper stories, longer versions -.
So you'll be doing a different -.
Longer versions.
You'll be putting out stories then before the book, which is usually it's the book and then -.
So when I did the Kerry and Romney books at the Boston Globe, one of those books was done a year ahead of time. The other came out January 1st of the campaign year. So in those cases, we couldn't be certain those would be the nominees, but we were pretty certain. Thank you very much.
Oh, so you used those -.
So those were done fairly early. This is -.
How did they sell? How did they do?
They did pretty well. Both those guys lost, so for what it's worth. They both were the nominees, but they both lost.
I'm going to win.
So you've got to take it for what it's worth. This is a book contract with the Post, not with us individually. So the Post, we work for the Post, and the Post has the contract do a book. But the main thing is that -.
I see, but you're in the Post.
Right.
Right, and you're a Post reporter also.
Yes, I'm a Post reporter, too, so the Washington Post is covering you. And just like we do stories, there'll be videos, there'll be stories. And then we're taking a lot of the material and turning it into a book because we both have written books before. So a lot of the material -.
Are you co-authors?
We'll be co-authors.
I see.
Right.
So you did one story that was such a very nicely written story. Otherwise, I wouldn't see you.
I appreciate that.
Because, again, I get covered very dishonestly. Do you know a great story, I'm just looking where your machine is. And by the way, I do this for fun. I just put this here. This is three months of coverage.
Yeah, yeah. It has like a movie quality to it.
Yeah.
Did you ever see that movie with Andy Griffith where he plays Lonesome Rhodes, the guy who rises up from being a radio guitar player to a candidate for president?
I haven't, but it sounds great.
It's really -.
I haven't, but it sounds great.
I read somewhere that you're a big Citizen Kane fan. Is that right?
Yeah.
One of the things that was in that, I think, that Blair book was it wasn't clear about whether you had actually ever gone back to Kallstadt, your ancestral home. Were you ever there?
Well, she said things, and she even did things with a name, and my family tell me she's wrong on the name, like, wrong, "Drumpf." And they tell me she's wrong. It's always been "Trump." In fact, I heard it was "Trump " with an "H" at the end.
So an example of this reporting we're trying to do -.
Go ahead.
-- there's a reporter, Frances Sellers, she went a couple of weeks ago to Kallstadt, to Germany, to do that part of the research. So that'll be a story that'll be in the paper I think actually.
Oh.
And then -.
How do they feel about me in Kallstadt?
Not everybody loves you obviously. But the point is that the Post is going to great lengths to make sure that we tell the full story. So one of the first things we did just chronologically is that Frances went to Karstadt. And to Marc's question, we had read conflicting things and weren't sure if you had actually been there yourself. Have you ever been Kallstadt yourself?
My father took me there years and years ago.
He did? So you have been there?
Many years ago.
How old?
When I was very young. I'd say I was 10.
So you have been there because we have read that you loved it, and the other stories left the impression you hadn't been there. So you were there when you were 10?
Yeah, many years ago when I was 10.
Was part of the family also from Sweden or was that something you had to say because of all the anti-Trump sentiment -.
No, but my father went to Sweden, and some people thought that. But my father went to Sweden for a period of time. But, no, my father was Germany, not from Sweden.
This is what we want to make sure. You mentioned you want to make sure stories are correct, and one of the things that we really want to do, and it may take some time on the telephone as follow-ups and so forth, is that you'll read conflicting things.
Right.
We don't want to assume that's from Book X to be correct.
Some people think I'm Swedish.
So anyway, you wrote in the Art of the Deal, then your father's family came from Sweden, so that actually came from your book written by a co-author, so we don't know if that's something that was just incorrectly stated or written.
Let me take a look at it.
So we don't know if that's correct, and -.
Let me take a look at it.
We want to go to the primary source.
But my father was from Germany.
Right, there's no question.
A hundred percent, and grew up, and it was Kallstadt, and it was wine country. It was serious Germany, which today is amazing what's going on in Germany. I'm amazed that that was allowed to happen with Germany. I'm very surprised because there's a lot of bad things happening in Germany right now.
When you say "what happened, " what period of time? You're talking about -.
Well, millions of people coming into Germany.
OK.
And they're having a tremendous assimilation problem right now, a tremendous assimilation problem.
They're really struggling.
Of course, we should've never gone into Iraq. We wouldn't have the problems. By destabilizing the Middle East, what a decision. That was one of the worst decisions in the history of the country, the decision to go after Iraq, the decision to go into Iraq.
While we're talking ancestry, your mother came from Scotland.
Correct.
And I did some genealogical research myself to try to figure out exactly when she came. There's this missing period that I couldn't quite fill in. She came over in 1930 as far as I could tell, the first trip.
OK.
And then she met your father it seemed like in '35, but I wasn't certain. There is a reference that they met at a party, and that he came home that night and told his mother "I met the woman I want to marry."
That's true.
Do you know if they met for the first time in '35, or how long had they known each other?
I could get the information because my sister, who's a Federal judge, who's actually on the Court of Appeals, she's so in love with the lore, the whole thing. But I could get that actually.
Right.
And she's a very highly respected person. She's not a person that talks to reporters. It's very interesting.
That was a story by Fred Barbash. I saw that. That was an interesting story.
Right. Was that for the Post?
Yeah, it was for the Post. I did see that.
It was a good story.
A picture -.
What's that? That's a picture of my father.
And did she ever act? Was she ever in shows or anything like that?
No, no, no, she was a homemaker and she loved it. She was a great mother. Her whole life was her five children, and she was a great mother. Couldn't have been better. But she just had that sense. I could see it. I always felt that. She didn't act on it, but she had the great sense.
-- why a military school and -.
Well, they thought it would be good for me because I was rambunctious. When you look at the kids today, I was extremely mild-mannered when you look at what's going on in schools today. But I was a little rambunctious. And they sent me up to New York Military Academy, which was great. It was a great thing for me.
No.
No, it was good. For me it was good. I actually liked the military way. I learned about the military way. But we had a lot of ex-drill sergeants that were tough, tough cookies. And there were no games. Today it could never be that way. They were very tough. Thinking back, it was a very positive influence as far as I'm concerned.
Did your father talk to you about that? Did he say we're sending you away to school, and it's a military school, and you need this toughening or something?
They wanted me to get a little bit more in line. I was a wise guy, and they wanted to get me in line. And it was a good school. It was a military academy. I could've gone to other military academies, but they liked the idea of a military academy because it automatically means more discipline than if you go up to a prep school.
And do you own -.
And now the real value of what I've built is worth over $10 billion. If I ever wanted to sell this stuff because I have the best locations. I have the best jobs. No matter what, whether it's buildings, or whether it's clubs, or whether it's like Doral, or Turnberry. I always liked iconic. Like owning Turnberry in Scotland is, it's on the ocean. It's four British Opens, which they call the Open Championship. They don't call it the "British Open, " but they call it the "Open Championship." So I always liked iconic, but I have some of the great properties of the world.
Do you remember what the first property in Manhattan was that you bought?
Yeah, well, the first was the Commodore Hotel that I optioned.
But before that, you wrote about how you would drive around looking for small -.
Oh, the little. Yeah, I did many little deals where I'd do townhouses, fix them up, little deals because that's -.
Drop dead.
Drop dead.
Yeah.
And anyway, I got it built. And everyone thought I was crazy, including my father, by the way. And what happened is literally from the day I opened, the rates started going up, up, up. The market turned from the day I bought I bought the property, and it became very successful, and ultimately I sold that. And now I've done many, many deals in Manhattan.
I have a hundred questions to ask you. I know you're running out of time.
Yeah. One or two and then we'll -.
OK. I did promise two other reporters to ask a question for their story for the daily paper.
Sure.
So I just want to meet their request -.
Go ahead.
Good friend.
I never said he should be Treasury secretary. He's a friend of mine. He's not the right person to be -.
He doesn't want to be Treasury secretary. OK. So we'll stipulate that he's not -.
Number one, he wouldn't want it, and he wouldn't be the type. It was so inaccurately written. Now, to negotiate with Japan and China, you can't get a better guy.
OK. Let me ask you this -.
But to be Treasury secretary, not the right guy.
OK. We'll stipulate that. Fair enough. What this story will talk a little bit is that you've known Icahn for 25 years -.
Right.
He was the biggest bondholder.
Yeah. So I said, hmm, I'm going to be dealing with him. And, again, off the record, because he is a friend of mine as much as Carl can be a friend, you understand. So off the record, I think that I made a great deal. He's a bondholder. And then he fought me a little bit, and I won the court case. You know about the lawsuit, right? There was a lawsuit.
Well, I know that at one he finally told the bondholders we need to take this deal for us.
Yeah, right. I left Atlantic City seven years ago, exactly seven years ago, and that was great timing because when I saw what was going on with Pennsylvania, once they approved gambling in Pennsylvania. And all the analysts said it won't have an impact on Atlantic City, and I said it's devastating to Atlantic City, and I left before then. But what happened with Atlantic City, I built some stuff. It was very good. I put massive junk bond debt on. I took it out. Then it took it public. I took it out. And then ultimately I left Atlantic City. It's much more complicated than this, but I left Atlantic City -.
Right. If you want to want to talk in more detail.
But I took a lot of money out, and I took that money and I bought a lot of stuff, and I have a lot of stuff right now that I would never have if it wasn't for Atlantic City. So Atlantic City was a great thing for me. But Carl and I have a very good relationship.
He did. He bought them at a discount and owned like 22 percent of the bonds.
Yeah, it doesn't matter. I mean, from my standpoint, I walked away with a fortune, but he may have bought them. When the bonds were down, you could've bought the bonds, so he may have bought them at a discount. So knowing Carl, that's probably true.
When you lead as public a life as you do, is it difficult to have -.
In fact, he probably did buy them. Otherwise, I'm sure he wouldn't have been in the thing.
The other very quick daily story question is for a reporter who's doing a story about the Scotland development. You mentioned the Scotland development. This is the one in Aberdeen -.
Yeah.
-- where you did say this is going to create 6,000 jobs, be a huge success. And this reporter went there and, you know, things haven't developed in the same timeframe you had hoped for. What's been the problem there that it hasn't come to fruition?
OK. Well, Aberdeen, it's 1,300 acres of land on the North Sea. It's one of the most beautiful pieces of land in the world, but you didn't see it, of course. The reporter said -.
Jenna Johnson, she went there -.
Did she say how good? Jenna Johnson is a good reporter?
She went to the island where your family is from, where your mother is from.
Oh, good.
And then she went to Aberdeen, so she would -.
Did she like what I built on Aberdeen, though? I mean, did she like it?
I think she stayed there.
Was she taken care of by Sarah Malone and all that?
I don't know.
Oh, she stayed in the castle that I fixed.
OK. I have a long -.
Does that make sense? Does that make sense to you?
We'll make sure we get that comment in there. And I have a list of questions on subjects, and I know we don't have time -.
What did Jenna Johnson think of it? I didn't know she -.
Let me ask you this one thing, and I'll let Marc handle the closing here -.
Go ahead.
-- or whatever time we have left. There are subjects like, we wanted to ask you about Roy Cohn, we wanted to ask you about different things in Brooklyn. So this is the process that we're working on. We're going to spend the next couple of months working on this -.
So we'll have a meeting every once in a while.
So we'd like to -.
If you're going to do a book, I'd like to at least have it be accurate.
That's what we want to do. Some things will be -.
At least a little accurate. The only problem is, the Washington Post has two types of writers. They have people that are just, they don't even have a clue. I don't know, maybe they do. Maybe they're purposely that way, I don't know.
Well, to get it right, there will be reporters who will contact you, and they'll say I'm doing this story. It's also for the book, so it'll be a twofer, and we'll want to get back in touch with you periodically with some broad things that we're doing today. And so, if we can do that, then we'll -.
The broad things I can talk about it. It's easy. And it started very simply with me coming into Manhattan and building what I've built.
And one of the things that's been kind of a theme through the years, and you've talked about this, using incentives, and abatements, and those kinds of things. You get some hardcore conservatives who say that that's not the conservative philosophy. That even though it's legal, that it's not a conservative way, and government shouldn't be doing that. So how do you work that with the conservative philosophy?
And they don't like eminent domain, and yet the pipeline that everybody wants build from Canada to Texas uses imminent domain, right? You know the story with the Club for Growth, right, where they came in and sat right in that thank you. I didn't even know. I had a meeting with, like a friend of mine called, will you meet with the club advisor? What's the Club for Growth? So they come in and they tell me, and then they ask me for a million. I say no. They write me a letter. Do you have a copy of the letter?
We were talking earlier about your father's style and a more aggressive tougher style, a public style. Was Roy Cohn important in sort of shifting that style or -.
Well, Roy was my lawyer. He was one of my lawyers, and Roy was a very good lawyer for me. If he wanted to be, he was a great lawyer. Roy had to like you, but Roy was a very smart guy. Graduated from Columbia, I think, at a very young age.
He went to Horace Mann and then Columbia -.
I think he graduated at 15 or something. His father was a brilliant judge. His mother was a very strong woman. And Roy had a whole crazy deal going, but Roy was a really smart guy who liked me, and did a great job for me on different things. I've been blessed with some really good lawyers in my life that did really good work for me. And I've had some lawyers that didn't do as good. That's more of the normal. But Roy was a great lawyer for me.
And that aggressive style of his, clearly that was something -.
It was him or it was me. It was a combination maybe, but it was a style that worked.
So you wrote in Art of the Deal, this was about the racial bias case. You met him at a club one night, that's the way you wrote about it in that book, and explained to him that you had just come that day from meeting with a different lawyer about whether to settle the case. And that lawyer was suggesting that you settle the case. This is your own description. And that you met him that night as it happened in the nightclub and asked him. Did you know him before or that was the first time you met him?
I didn't know him. I think I met him that night.
So you met him that night, and then he said I don't settle, and you liked that.
Yeah.
And he became your lawyer. Now, you did eventually settle the case a couple of years later.
I did, but we settled it absolutely with no admission of anything. We did nothing wrong. But that wasn't a case against us. There were many, many landlords that were sued under that case.
Well, this case was against you, your father -.
No, no, but many landlords.
There were other cases, but that case was against you.
Yeah, that was, yeah. But I meant that was one of many cases.
I guess what we're getting at is you left Brooklyn-Queens, that world you knew. You had written in your book that some of those things there were unpleasant. You wanted to look to Manhattan, build in Manhattan, and that you had worked with your father. You wanted to be your own person understandably, and that you met Roy Cohn, and that he in some ways seemed to be your mentor as you looked to Manhattan to be a Manhattan developer.
Well, I had other lawyers other than Roy. Roy was a lawyer.
You developed your style in part by watching him, it seems like from you wrote.
Perhaps. I mean, I was young. Perhaps, but I think even at a young age I had a certain style. I had a certain feel. But Roy was one of my lawyers who did a very good job. He did a great job. But a lot of people don't realize with Roy because is a very controversial name, and yet his best friend was Si Newhouse. He represented Steinbrenner. He represented amazing clients, and yet he was very controversial for all of the reasons that you know, but he was a very controversial guy. But he had an amazing list of clients. So listen, we'll do it again.
OK.
See if we can get it accurate, as accurate as possible, as long as you have to. If you didn't do it, I'd be very happy. If you're going to do it, we might as well try and get it right.
That's what we'll do. We appreciate it.
Honestly it would be good. I'd like to have one right. It would be nice. It doesn't happen.
We share the same goal.
And, again, I'm glad you did that story, sir, because that's why I'm talking to you.
Thank you.
OK, so let us know. So you'll just work with Rona a little bit, OK?
Very good.
OK. Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I appreciate it. Thank you.
Did you?
I'm not so sure. She believed it. I'm not so sure. But it -- yeah, I had confidence. I know the people of the country and they want to see things happen. And, honestly, they want to see things happen quickly.
But that's the Republican primary. 30 million people vote in the Republican primary, 130 million vote in the general election.
Right.
Yes and to Savannah's point, it's a valid one, though. It's different in a Republican primary than in a general election.
I agree with that, you know, but I think it'll come along.
Let's get to some of our town hall questioners.
OK.
Mr. Trump, good morning. Good to see you.
Good morning.
We've got a lot questions, so let's get started with Andrew Sullivan, Brooklyn New York, registered Republican and a supporter of yours.
Thank you. Hi.
Hello, Mr. Trump. Full disclosure, I did work for you. And I appreciate the ten years of good union construction work you provided for me and my family. God bless you.
Good. Good. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you Jim. Just so -- just to make sure I'm clear here, you're going to bomb the you know what out of ISIS. But you have a comprehensive plan?
I do.
I don't -- I'm not for Cruz.
Because he was born in Canada. But, you know what? He has no path right now...
What's your plan for her relatives?
You -- they've been here how many years?
I've got 25 years.
So we're going to do something for people that have been -- look, we're either going to have a country or we're not going to have a country. But many people are very fine people. And I'm sure these are very, very fine people. They're going to go, and we're going to create a path where we can get them into this country legally, OK? But it has to be done legally.
By the way, they are from Ecuador and I'm organizing the relief effort for Ecuador and I need transportation for volunteers and supplies.
OK. Very good.
Do you have any transgender people working in your organization?
I don't know.
No?
I really don't know. I probably do. I really don't know.
All right. So if Caitlyn Jenner were to walk into Trump tower and wanted to use the bathroom, you would be fine with her using any bathroom she chooses?
That is correct.
Different issue, also a social issue...
You know, there's a big move to create new bathrooms. Problem with that is for transgender. That would be -- first of all, I think that would be discriminatory in a certain way. It would be unbelievably expensive for businesses and for the country. Leave it the way it is.
Let's talk about abortion, another potent issue. The Republican platform, every four years, has a provision that states that the right of the unborn child shall not be infringed. And it makes no exceptions for rape, for incest, for the life of the mother. Would you want to change the Republican platform to include the exceptions that you have?
Yes, I would. Yes, I would. Absolutely. For the three exceptions. I would.
Would you have an exception for the health of the mother?
I would leave it to the life of the mother, but I would absolutely have the three exceptions.
All right. Let's go back to the crowd here Mr. Trump. Dr. Priscilla Peramas Warren of Scarsdale, New York. She's married with one son, registered Republican and a supporter of yours.
Thank you.
On the Democratic side...
Two good people, but I think they'll be gone very soon.
On the Democratic side of things, huge issue is Wall Street banks. I mean, they're firing at each other on that subject. You're a guy who said you know the Wall Street bankers better than anyone.
Better than anyone.
Good morning, Mr. Trump and congratulations on your big win in New York.
Thank you very much.
Mr. Trump, thank you so much for your time this morning.
Thank you.
All right, I think the final number was what, 91, 92 delegates out of New York. That's almost a complete sweep.
Yes, we got most of them, almost every one of them. We really had a big win. And we were over 61 percent. It was an amazing evening. It's nice, Sean, when the people that know you best really like you. So that tells you something. So we had a great evening.
But it's interesting. But in spite of that, your campaign had an internal memo somehow made it into the press that you believe you could get as many as 1,400 delegates. Paul Manafort...
Yes, we think we can.
Game over.
No Republican will even campaign -- it's game over. No Republican other than me will even campaign in New York. They won't waste one day there because they can't win. Look at Cruz. I mean, he came in third to Kasich, and nobody understands how that's even possible. But you just take a look. He cannot get anything in a lot of these states.
In other words, let the state decide what local community decides, kind of like your position on education, give it back to the states.
Yes, let them decide. Absolutely.
All right. I have asked you many times about your tax plan. You were asked that question this morning about raising taxes on the wealthy.
Right.
I go all the time.
It's -- they're decimated up there.
Decimated.
They're decimated. It's horrible...
Yes.
We're the highest taxed in the world. We're going to get taxes down. But the Wall Street guys with the carried interest and stuff -- we got to get rid of some -- and nobody understands the system better -- really, I understand the system by far better than anybody, and they know it.
Yes.
And that's why I don't think I'm going to get so much backing from Wall Street...
He pays 14 percent taxes! I paid 40 federal. I need a better accountant -- 40 federal. I pay city tax of 4 percent and a state tax of 10 percent. It's insane!
I know.
All right...
... the greatest of any candidate running. And for business, likewise big reduction.
Or New Jersey.
You saw what I did...
If you get this nomination...
... unites, we're going to have a total victory.
You told me people like Scalia and Thomas, but...
Two...
I know you got a big crowd...
Two wonderful names.
All right, I know you got a big crowd there. Mr. Trump, thank you. Appreciate it. We'll talk soon.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
All right, so let me...
What -- what right has he got...
Well, AOL News said that Bobby Knight in Indiana will endorse Donald Trump. Do you know if that's true?
Well, let me just say that I have a lot of respect for Bobby Knight.
OK.
He was tough and smart and still is.
We got to...
And I have an awful lot of respect. I won't say who it is, but I'll tell you what. Bobby Knight is called gold standard for Indiana, and as far as I'm concerned for anywhere else. I mean, this is a tough, smart, incredible guy. So we'll see what it is, but it could be Bobby Knight.
Let me ask this...
Because they can't take it anymore. And of course, Sheriff Joe Arpaio endorsed me also, who's from Arizona and who, as you know, is very tough on the borders. And we have to be very strong. Let people in, but they have to come in legally, Sean.
There are 81,410,000 families in the United States for the year 2015, of which 19.7 percent of American families, where there's not one family member -- that's 20 percent -- that have a job, that are working. Yet we keep hearing that the unemployment numbers have gone down. Are we being lied to?
Well, they're phony numbers. You know, when you hear 5 percent and 5.1 percent, those were set up years ago by presidents and by politicians to make the country sound better because it sounds good. Our real number is probably over 20 percent. When you give up looking for a job, they consider you statistically employed.
Yes.
It's absolutely outrageous. And you know what? We just left thousands and thousands of people on stage. I just made a speech. And they wouldn't be here, in all fairness, including borders and everything else, if this economy was good.
Let me...
In Pennsylvania, manufacturing is down 40 percent. And everywhere else, it's down 40, 50, 60 percent. Our jobs are leaving our country. And I'm going to stop it. And I can stop it.
Did you see...
I know how to stop it.
All right...
And I think it's really unfair and not a good thing.
Last question.
Not a good thing.
All right...
They failed as candidates. They failed. And -- but I do think this. I do think it's all going to come together. People are calling me that you wouldn't believe want me to come on. And I'm telling you, we're going to have a unified party, and I'm going to win and we're going to beat Hillary Clinton badly.
All right. Thank you both for being with us. We appreciate your time.
All right, thank you very much.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Donald...
But he'll talk about me.
Right.
And it's so dishonest. And it's hard to believe. The whole thing is hard to believe actually. But it makes him look weak.
You know...
But despite that I'm winning by a lot of delegates and I'm winning by millions of votes. So, you know, that's like the fighter. You have to go into the ring and knock them out.
Right.
And it's just so many -- people are so tired and so sick of incompetent politicians. And that's why I'm doing well.
What...
And I haven't focused on her. But when I focus on her, I think you're going to see some very good results, I mean, personally.
What about your cabinet, would you have women on your cabinet?
Absolutely. I would have women. I would have the most capable people on my cabinet. But I would certainly have women.
Speaking of women, a woman actress by the name of Lena Dunham, she said this yesterday. I know a lot of people have been threatening to do this, but I really will. I know a lovely place in Vancouver. I can get my work done from there. She says she's going to move to Canada, Donald Trump, if you get elected. What's your message to her?
Well, she's a B-actor. And you know, has no -- you know, no mojo. You know, I heard Whoopi Goldberg said that too. That would be a great, great thing for our country if she said that.
We have a list of people. Rosie O'Donnell.
No this -- no Rosie O'Donnell? We'll get rid of Rosie? Oh, I love it.
No. Rosie O'Donnell. You're not insulted? John Stewart, Whoopi.
Well now I have to get elected. Now I have to get elected, because I'll be doing a great service to our country. I have to. Now, it's much more important. In fact, I'll immediately get off this call and start campaigning right now.
Knock them out without revealing your strategy.
But you have to be quiet. You have to be unpredictable. You know, we're so predictable. We're sending in 250 troops. You have to be unpredictable. Can you imagine, like General George Patton saying, oh, we're sending this, we're sending that. He wouldn't talk, he'd just knock the hell old of them. It would be over in a week.
Loose lips sink ships. All right. Donald Trump, thank you very much.
OK.
And we thank him for that.
Thank you.
Hello Mr. Trump, Stephen K. Bannon. How're you doing, sir?
Well, Steve, how're you doing?
I'm doing great. Look, big night last night but I wanna pivot because we don't have a lot of time. Hillary Clinton. The -- you made a comment the other day that she's going to be easy. Now -- to defeat her and the Clinton apparatus. Let me stipulate maybe doable, maybe possible, but how do you get to how do you get to "easy"?
You said "easy"?
You said "easy." You said beating her is going to be easy.
I would I would say that I've gone against a lot of very talented people in the Republicans and one by one you've watched it, Steve, they drop off and they drop off and I just feel that she's so flawed. I don't know that she'll be able to run because of the email scandal so I really don't know. I mean I assume that they're gonna let her run which is by itself a problem for her, but I believe that she'll be easy. She'll be horrible on jobs. She is horrible on the military and on the border. She wants to have open borders with people flying through and we can't have that, with crime, with economic development, etc etc, and just on those two issues alone if you talk about jobs, if you talk about the economy, if you talk about border, and if you talk about military. Because people want strength today and she doesn't have strength and she doesn't have stamina and she will never have it, and I think she'll be easy to beat.
Clinton cash.
And I think we'll whip out that book because that book will become very pertinent. I'm surprised it hasn't been used by Sanders actually. But that book was unbelievably well written and unbelievably factual. Yeah she took money and she did favors for it. There's no question about it.
Mr. Trump, thank you so much for taking time I know it's a very busy morning after your huge victory last night. Thank you very much for joining us at Breitbart News Daily.
Thank you Steve, thank you very much
Of course it is.
Your chart works beautifully, as operated by John King usually. But we seem to get there. We seem to get over the number, and as you know, if we were short 50, there's so many roving delegates around that are going to be looking for a home, you get them pretty easily, I mean.
Well, let's talk about Indiana because now that is the big state on everybody's map. That will be the big stand for this so-called alliance between Kasich and Cruz. What do you make of their efforts to join against you? Do you have the energy to take them on? You sound pretty beat this morning, but when you get to Indiana, you'll be taking on the both of them in a united effort.
Yes. No, I'm not beat. I did get up a little bit early to do your show. I want to -- you know, you asked me to do it and I'm doing it.
Thank you.
But I was up late last night, I will say that. We're all celebrate -- you know, we celebrate and then we go back to work, but we're doing your show, and that's an honor. So I go to Indiana. I have Bobby Knight tonight is going to endorse Trump. Bobby Knight is the most revered coach in the history, I guess, of Indiana. He's great. A great guy. A great coach. People love him.
How about Mike Pence? Have you reached out for the governor's endorsement yet?
Yes. The governor's a great guy. I've met with him. He may not endorse. I don't think he'll endorse anybody, actually -- and he may endorse us. I don't know. He's a great guy. He's become -- you know, he's done a very, very good job as governor and he's a great guy. I don't know if we'll get his endorsement. I don't know. I don't think...
Do you think he's going to endorse Cruz? Oh, you don't think so. You don't think he'll come out and endorse if it's not you?
No, I don't think so.
Well, it's always good to have some policy mixed into a presidential election at some point. --
I think so.
Do you agree with President Obama about sending 250 or even more troops into Syria to help the effort there? The special operators that he announced that he's sending in. Do you agree with that move?
Well, I could agree with it, but I don't agree with telling it to the world. I would send them in quietly because right now they have a target on their back. So I would agree with it much more. I don't know what purpose they're being sent in for, but I would agree with it. I can live with it, but what I don't like doing is sending them in so -- I mean, you know, with such fanfare. Let them go in, let them go in quietly, be unpredictable, but I just -- you know, from my standpoint, I just find it very, very hard that every time we do something we announce it for publicity reasons, and I think that's very negative. I think that's a bad thing.
What does it mean when you say change to presidential? What do you think presidential is that you're not right now?
Well I view presidential -- just being a lower key version of myself and being sure not to use any language that would be offensive, but I don't do that anyway. I feel that I shouldn't be doing that. I was doing that for a period of time for emphasis, but I feel that I shouldn't be doing that. I'm not -- you know, I'm not doing that. And -- I used to, you know -- make speeches when I was non-political, I used some foul language and it would make things very exciting and people would go crazy, but when you're running for office it's a little bit different, as your brother knows. Right?
Well, yeah, I think that trying not to curse is probably the least of reaching that bar, but let's look at why that would be a concern.
No. It might be the most of reaching that bar.
How do you call someone on being a woman?
You just tell them they're playing the woman's card.
But what does that mean exactly?
Frankly, if she didn't she would do very poorly.
How do you know that?
I know it because I think if she were a man and she was the way she is, she would get virtually no votes.
Well, that's a -- we take great pride in that estimation.
Although Errol is very biased against me, which is too bad.
Errol Louis says that is not true and he is very happy that you got up so early this morning.
Errol is totally biased. There are others over there, but Errol is -- some day I'm going to watch him say something good about Trump and I'll be so happy. He's very biased.
Well you know what, keep watching NEW DAY, then, Mr. Trump, because that's where Errol Louis is when he's not on his own show. Appreciate you getting up early this morning. Congratulations on last night. We do look forward to covering very closely what happens going forward.
OK. Thank you very much.
Have a good day.
Bye.
Donald -- Donald, are you feeling more presidential this morning?
Yes, yes I get...
Oh, stop it.
... more and more presidential.
He's going to sound presidential, hold on. Sound presidential for us.
I get more and more presidential as I have victories, absolutely.
Sounds like he's lying in bed.
No, I'm not.
You sound really excited to be on Morning Joe.
I am. It's always exciting.
It's -- it's -- it's wonderful. The first time it's happened. All right, so -- so should Ted Cruz and John Kasich drop out of the race?
They should have. In fact, I heard they were having a news conference last night to drop out of the race and they canceled the news conference. So, I don't know. Look, they have to play their game. John is now 1 for 47 and Ted is, you know, a disaster. I guess I'm 3.5 million votes up on him or something. It's -- it's a crazy thing. It's crazy. And they have no highway, it's over. So I think we're doing very well. I think we're going to do very well in Indiana. We have the great Bobby Knight endorsing me tonight, which I look forward to, and it's going to be exciting.
So, can you -- are -- are you ready to predict that you're going to get to 1,237 and more when it comes to delegates?
Well, I've been saying that for a month. I think we're going to get it. I think we're going to get it fairly easily and I think we're going to have an amazing -- I think we're going to do great in Indiana, I think we're going to do great in California, and I think there's some states in between that we're going to get.
Yes. Were you surprised last night by the scope of the victories?
Yes.
Yes, talk about that.
Well, the scope was fantastic. You know, I was told if I get 50 it's good, and I was told that you couldn't get 50 in all of them because, you know, getting 50, Joe, you and I discussed this and I discussed it at length last night, but getting 50 is very tough when you have three people.
Right.
And you know, if you look at where I won by 60 and 62, and last week it was 62 in New York, and you have three people, I mean, if you had 62 and you had one person, that's considered a landslide victory, right? And if you win by 5 points, you know, if you're one on two, it would be, you know, really, really amazing. Now, I mean, if you win on a one-on-one by 5 points that's considered pretty much of a landslide, right? So I'm getting, you know, essentially 60 percent against two other candidates.
Yes.
Pretty amazing.
Are you -- are you at this point, I mean, you have to be thinking about vice presidential picks. Are you starting in your, excuse me...
I am in my own mind, but I don't want to talk about him because I don't want to even think about it until this is over. You know, I heard Cruz is going to start to think about vice -- you know, vice presidential picks. He may -- he may pick Carly Fiorina. And, oh, I see Rhode Island, I'm just looking at your screen, Rhode -- Rhode Island is 64. That's a good number.
... and maybe you should just kind of drop out of the race.
I know. And it's my ceiling with three people, Joe.
Yes.
It's not my -- don't forget, if I had two people, the 64 would have been 80.
Donald, congratulations on your...
Hey, Mike.
... crushing sweep last night, first of all.
Thank you. Thank you.
All right, so...
There were some interesting times, but -- but you're going to see something -- we will make America greater than ever before.
It seems that would be the one area where perhaps you -- I mean, I don't know what -- you -- you say you have plans for Hillary, but I would think she's incredibly strong on those issues.
Well, I haven't quite recovered, it's early in the morning, from her shouting that message. And I know a lot of people would say you can't say that about a woman, because of course a woman doesn't shout. But the way she shouted that message was not -- oh, I just -- that's the way she said it, and it's -- I guess I'll have to get used to a lot of that over the next four or five months.
Well, what about issues pertaining to women that she discussed, including equal pay and right to choose?
Oh, we'll -- we'll do -- we're going to do very well. We're going to do very well with Hillary and with women as soon as we start our process against her. We're going to do very well. I don't even know if it's going to be Hillary. I mean, we're all waiting to find out what happens with the email scandal. I -- I don't know what's going on with the email scandal. It's taking longer and longer.
Yes.
She's -- she's guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, but they don't want to -- they don't want to go after her. I -- it's going to be an interesting thing, but she's got a problem because people at the far left are sitting in jail cells.
So, you said Hillary Clinton was shouting her message. I think Bernie Sanders shouts his message, too, right?
Well, Bernie Sanders has a message that's interesting. I'm going to be taking a lot of the things that Bernie said and using them. I can re-read some of his speeches and I can get some very good material. He said, you know, in many ways she shouldn't be there. He said some things about her that are actually surprising, you know, that essentially she has no right to even be running and she's got bad judgment. When she said -- when he said bad judgment, I said, sound bite. But Bernie has been very effective, been treated very badly by the Democrats and by the Democratic party and, frankly, should run as an independent, I think.
Yes, they're -- they're very -- cheered.
Well, congratulate them. They -- I like -- I like Nicole's parents.
Donald, congratulations. I'm looking forward to this -- to your speech today. I'll be down in Washington to hear you.
Good, John.
Concrete walls, wires hanging down.
I already have the space rented for a fortune. The day -- the day the campaign ends, I get the highest rent in the city. The day the campaign ends, I'll build it out for a computer company. You know, it's one of those things.
Yes, yes, yes.
So, it's fine.
All right.
But -- but I like it in concrete. To me -- I like -- I actually like it in the concrete, so the other looks sort of ridiculous to me. And there's a rough space, so, we have -- we have that. And it started off, and we came in in Iowa second, a close second, got no credit for it, and Marco got a lot of credit for coming in third. I came -- got no credit for coming in second. It's a race that I could have -- should have come in first actually, and because I had -- I had the votes, but the caucus process was not a process that -- that I frankly ever heard of, OK? You know, I had -- I had -- I'd been doing this for a of couple months.
Hey, Donald, you're -- you're locking down the nomination and you're still going back to Iowa.
No, no, they asked me about the campaign.
You remind me of someone I know.
No, no, they asked me about the campaign.
OK.
So, then we went to New Hampshire, I won it, we went to South Carolina.
Right.
We went to all these states and I started winning like crazy and have been winning ever since. But the campaign has gotten bigger, it's evolved, right? And so, we started with Corey as the manager and Hope doing a lot of work. Hope is terrific, too. And all we're doing is adding more people.
Yes.
Now, Paul actually gets along very well with Corey. They get along. They have different functions. And they are -- the functions are broken up. But I brought -- I brought Paul in because a very, very smart friend of mine who knew him very well said he is fantastic, OK, and -- and he's somewhat political, my friend. He's actually a very successful businessman, but he's -- he's a political type.
Right.
He loves politics, like -- like all of you. And he said this guy is fantastic. I brought Paul in, and Paul has done a really good job. And the two guys get along, the only time they don't is when a phony paper like Politico will write a story that has no bearing in truth, I mean, no bearing whatsoever. This Politico rag, they -- they write stories that are so false with no comment and they never call me. They never ask me for a quote. You know, I'm the only one that does -- honestly, I'm the only one that matters because I'm the -- it's my campaign.
You're the one in charge. Let me ask you about...
And they don't even call me to ask.
It's not like you're not available.
And then -- and then I'll read a story that is so unbelievably bad, but they don't call me to ask me that question, so they can never know the answer.
Right.
But I'm telling you, they get along really well.
Doing fine, OK.
They -- they have separate functions, very separate functions, and they're doing great.
So, let me ask you, in closing, you had said that Bernie Sanders -- by the way, I just want to go back. Yes, we -- we have been critical of you from time to time, but we've never questioned, like everybody else, whether you were going to win this thing or not because it seemed obvious to us, especially Mika, from the beginning, that you would.
Well, Mika knows talent, I will say. She's like a talent scout.
Exactly, she's been trying to get me fired for nine years.
She -- she knows -- she knows great talent.
But -- but -- but are you going to work with the RNC or are you -- if you win the nomination, are you going to get a new group of people in there?
Well, I'm going to try, Joe. I think so. I mean, the campaign, the -- the -- and -- and to a certain extent the RNC inherited this, but this delegate system is a scam. It's a scam. Now, with that being said, in Pennsylvania I did really well, because I got the 17, plus I got many, many more that are already pledged that you -- I have -- I don't think have reported, but I have many. They have a great -- a great chairman there.
Yes.
Rob Gleason. And I have -- a great -- really a great leader. And I got many, many delegates in Pennsylvania that you people haven't been reporting on because you don't know yet, and -- and it will be announced, but a lot of them. And you know, we did the whole pledge card thing.
Yes.
And we -- but the -- but the whole system of -- of what's being going on, where I win in Louisiana and end up with less delegates.
Oh, it's outrageous.
The whole system is a scam.
And you know, right now, Donald...
And the whole system is rigged.
Right now, Donald, we're -- we're showing showing...
Hey, Joe, the only way I...
How do you not automatically get every delegate?
Every single -- by the way, every single county, so I should get every delegate. And in Pennsylvania they do have a morals provision where they will back, you know, they -- they're morally inclined to back if -- if you win, and I won everything there.
Third, yes.
I mean, so I don't know. I don't know where he's going.
Right.
Ted doesn't have the ability to get votes. Mika picked that up a long time ago, perhaps faster than anybody else. Mika gets nauseous when she watches this guy speak.
Now, come on.
And frankly, Ted -- Ted Cruz...
I do, I do.
... cannot -- I'm trying to be nice to you, OK?
No, I appreciate it.
Ted Cruz cannot get votes. The only way Ted Cruz gets votes is when -- when it's a scam deal. He'll go to Colorado where they don't vote, he'll go to Wyoming where they don't vote, he'll go to a caucus which the caucus is fixed. The guy can't get votes. He's not a good politician.
All right.
And -- so, but he shouldn't be trying to pick-off delegates. We should get 100 percent of the delegates in Pennsylvania, and it looks like that's where we're heading.
Thank you, Donald.
Well, thank you very much. I really appreciate it.
All right. Talk to you soon.
Thank you.
How fast could you operate? Because North Korea...
I think it can be very quick.
All right. Your question for Mr. Trump.
Did she say always vote for Trump?
Mr. Trump...
Yes.
Mr. Trump, thank you for meeting with us tonight. I'm actually a senior this year Traders Point, and heading off to Wabash College in the fall.
Good.
As we all know, candidate Sanders is offering free college tuition. I think that this is...
I think he's leaving the race today, by the way. So he has got some difficulty. But go ahead.
I think that this is unattainable, and obviously unachievable.
Sure.
We have a question, Donald, from Steven in the audience.
Hi, Steven.
But what about a country like -- well, let's take a country like Pakistan has sometimes double dealt us...
Well, Pakistan is...
So you...
Now there are countries...
-- would you cut out giving some of this humanitarian aid...
I'd...
-- to these countries...
-- I'd try j
And thank you for being here.
Thank you.
And Mr. Trump, I -- it was brought to my attention ON THE RECORD by Greta the amount of wasteful spending in the government.
It's tremendous.
And the lack of accountability.
Right.
I think -- I think more than an hour with me would be enough for -- for Donald.
The truth is...
You say bad things, too. You can...
No, no, no...
It -- it's -- politics is a unique business.
It's a strange world here, Greta.
Let's talk to Donald Trump about all this. He is on the phone with us now. Mr. Trump, good morning to you.
Good morning.
But...
And I'm going to be doing -- I'm going to be doing a -- a policy speech on immigration fairly soon.
Yeah, but people are casting votes. And so, they should know whether or not a vote for you means a massive military presence in the Middle East.
But Savannah, if I get elected president, I don't want ISIS to know what I'm going to be doing. I don't like the idea.
Thanks for joining us this morning.
Thank you very much.
All right. So you would keep the 10,000 troops there. And fight a war of attrition against the Taliban? You know, Pakistan --
I hate doing it, I hate doing it so much. But, again, you have nuclear weapons in Pakistan so I would do it.
Yes. But Pakistan is no friend to the U.S.A. In fact, the guy who helped us, the doctor who helped us the Pakistani get Bin Laden, they put him in prison. Do you think you could get that doctor out?
Yes, I do. I think I would get him out in two minutes. I would tell them let them out and I'm sure they would let them out. Because we give a lot of aid to Pakistan. We give a lot of money to Pakistan. And frankly, they will do -- they don't have any respect for our president. But when you say they take advantage or they are no friend. Nobody is a friend to us. They just take us like a bunch of suckers, Bill. And that's what my speech was about to a certain extent. It was also economic in terms of economic, relative to aid and the military. But Pakistan certainly takes advantage like everybody else. Nobody is different.
All right. Now, we talked about ISIS way back in June when you were just launching your campaign. And you said last night the same thing you told me then that you are not going to tell ISIS how you are going to defeat them. OK.
Well, I did say, Bill, I mean, I must be honest, I have been saying for a long time I would rather be unpredictable. You know, we are so predictable.
All right.
The problem is when you say that you are giving them, you're giving them a lot of ideas.
But there is an implication to your policy and if I'm wrong in the implication, you need to tell me. For Libya, example, when you say that I say if you are elected president, then you are going to send in American bombers and bomb those oil fields, so they are useless to ISIS. Would I be wrong in thinking that as a voter?
Maybe a little bit wrong. I try and take the oil fields but I will say I know Exxon Mobile. I know many of the great oil companies. They can get in there. It's amazing how quickly they can get that stuff.
But they can't defeat these ISIS people private companies, so you would have to send in American ground troops which I think you'll going to have to do anyway.
Yes. We will have to bomb and we may have to do something but we'll have to bomb and we will have to get people in the region or we'll have to bomb and just keep the oil. I have been saying keep the oil for years.
OK. But in order to get the oil, you have to defeat the guys on the ground who are now running the oil fields.
That is correct.
And that is going to require American Special Forces, paratroopers, airborne, all of that to go in. And beat these guys on the ground. So, again, implication, I'm thinking you are saying you are going to send in ground troops to defeat ISIS in Syria and Libya, no?
Bill, or we are going to use our so-called allies. We don't have such great allies between us, OK?
OK. But again, correct me if I'm wrong --
I have said that for years.
Yes. It sounds to me like a President Trump would use ground troops to some extent to, a, seize oil from ISIS and, B, kill them.
Well, two things. Number one, I want the oil. Number two, I would send as few in as possible. And I would try and use other people if possible --
OK, if possible.
-- except they just don't seem to have the capability. They don't seem to have the capability.
You're going to have say you ask people in with them. You know, there is only 6,000 active fighters.
Yes. We have got to get the oil. We have got to get the oil.
Right.
Because that's their source of wealth. Now, they also have a lot of wealth through the banking channels. You have comb the dark banking channels. And they're getting a lot of wealth through them. People don't even know about it but they are. But the oil is the main thing.
OK.
We're going to cut off the oil and we have got to keep the oil. Not give it right back to them. We have got to keep the oil.
So you would try --
I would love to try it.
You would try it?
I would certainly try it.
Do you have a stick in case Putin is unreasonable which he is known to be? Do you have a stick?
Well, you know, we always have a stick. We have the economy. We have certain things that are advantages. I mean, we do have this --
All right. All we have to do is cut off American banking credit cards and he is done.
And by the way --
OK. China.
Bill, including with China we have tremendous power with China because they suck our money out. They suck our jobs out. We have rebuilt China. You look at the bridges, the roads, the train systems, the airports they have. It's like we are now a third world country.
OK.
They took that and much of it came out of our country.
But here's the deal. If you tee the Chinese off by a trade war or slapping tariffs on their products coming in here, they will be less incline to do help with you North Korea and that was one of the things you mentioned in your policy address that you are going to mobilize China.
They don't help us now.
I know. But how are you ever going to get China to help us neutralize North Korea if you saber rattle in the trade area?
By telling them if you don't help us, it's going to be over. We're just not going to --
So, you are going to threaten them?
Well, we have a trade deficit bill. It's not a threat. It's a fact. Oka? We have a trade deficit of $505 billion a year with China. They are just ripping us, left and right. And on top of it, they won't help us with North Korea because who wants to get into that fight. They won't help us. They can solve that North Korea, believe it or not is concerned with China. OK. They are truly concerned with China.
Sure, we know that.
China has power over North Korea. North Korea could solve that problem in one day, in one meeting. Probably in one phone call. North Korea is -- should behave and China can make them behave. China doesn't do it because they are tweaking us. They have no respect for President Obama and they have no respect for our country. And, yet, we are the ones that really we created China, economically they took our money, they took our jobs. You know, we owe them right now $1.8 trillion.
Yep.
OK? So they take our jobs.
They are holding our bonds.
So, they take our jobs, they take our money and we owe them money.
Right.
So we have a lot of power, but we don't know how to use it and we have a president that knows how to deal.
Now, do you think Miss Guthrie was offended by your statement about Hillary Clinton?
It doesn't really matter to me. I mean, she is perfectly nice but I don't really care. I mean, it's a fact. She is playing the woman card and it's the only thing she has got going. That's it.
What about?
And she is playing as much as she can. I mean, I've been watching it. I mean, all she does, every time she raises if you raise your voice, it's like oh, look what he is saying and look at the way he talks. Give me a break. I mean, she raises her voice much more than I raise mine, believe me.
What about this sexism thing? I don't really know what this is. Any time I say or criticize a woman I'm accused of being a sexist. But any time I criticize the African-American community in any way or that I'm a racist. If I criticize illegal immigrants, then I'm anti-poor and anti- Hispanic, I think that's going to be a major team directed against you, any time you criticize Hillary Clinton you are a sexist. Are you ready for that?
No. I don't think it will. And I will tell you why. She is going to try and play it but I'm going to bring jobs back to this country. Nobody respects women more than I do by the way. And I see it at the rallies. And you saw just the other day in New York and Pennsylvania. I won all these states in landslides. And I just absolutely killed everybody with the women. The women came out in droves. And I won the women category. I won African-American. I won -- I won virtually every category. I won landslides. And that means the five that we just won and in New York the week before. But I won with women and just about every group. In fact, every other group.
Not to miss the view.
In terms of this. No, I really feel it because she --
I know you do.
She had the record that's terrible and she has got a lot of problems. I don't know, Bill, that she is going to be able to run. And I don't think you know that either.
Nobody knows.
But she is running. She is only running because she is being protected by the Democrats. Without that she wouldn't have a chance of running.
I asked you this last time and I'm sure you have thought about it, do you think the FBI is straight up? Do you think that Comey, the director, is playing politics or is he going to do an honest investigation and tell the folks what really happened?
Well, I hear fantastic -- I don't know him. I hear fantastic things, beyond fantastic. Now, with that being said, I just don't know what goes on behind the scenes. I can say that I hope he is straight up. I think if he is straight up that she is not going to be able to run. I hope she can run in one way because I would love to run against her. I will beat her. And Cruz can't beat her and Kasich, I mean, give me a break he is one for 44.
Yes. But that is what they say about you, you know, you guys all can say that about each others --
Take a look at the new polls. Take a look at the new polls. OK, just take a look at the new polls.
All right.
And you will see what happens. Remember, this Bill, I haven't even started yet.
Now, I've got to tell you, strategists in both parties say if you consciously went about it, if you specifically planned you couldn't have said anything that would drive your numbers among women even lower.
Really? OK. Well, I'm my own strategist and I like that -- what I said and it's true. I only tell the truth and that's why people voted for me.
I understand, but Hillary Clinton is a different --
I won with the women by landslides, you don't mention that.
Let me --
And I've been saying for a long time, keep the oil. ISIS now has Libyan oil. You know, it's among the finest oils in the world. ISIS now has the Libyan oil. We don't even do anything to --
Mr. Trump --
We don't even do anything to stop it. They're making a fortune with Libyan oil.
So, would it be fair to say that Hillary Clinton would be the hawk in this race?
But, Chris, we have so many things to do with our country, we can't have this anymore. We are spending all of our money in the Middle East. We're spending numbers that are crazy.
So, Mr. Trump --
And on top of that, we're defending the world. We're the policeman to the world.
Would it be fair to say --
And this country can't afford to do it.
Mr. Trump --
-- killing lives, and I mean lives on both sides, OK?
Mr. Trump, we're running out of time.
Hundreds of thousands, hundreds of thousands, even millions of people have been killed --
Mr. Trump --
-- because of horrible decision-making by our presidents.
-- we're running out of time and for my 20th anniversary, let me ask a couple of questions, OK?
Yes.
Mr. Trump, thank you. Thanks for your time and thank you so much for coming in today, sir.
Thank you very much. Happy anniversary.
I think we're going to be joined right now by Donald Trump. Good morning, sir.
Good morning.
Can I tell you? I've been to rock concerts yesterday that did not have the energy amongst the crowd that you had.
Well, that's good. That's good. We have great energy. You know, we were in Fort Wayne yesterday among many other places, and that was an amazing crowd we had, wasn't it? I hope you enjoyed it.
Can I tell you also that you play the Rolling Stones louder than the Rolling Stones do, by the way.
They're great.
We've had a lot of analysis on the radio station in the past couple of weeks about Donald Trump and his road to victory, and millennials are going to play a part in that, veterans are going to play a part in that. There's a lot of different backgrounds that are coming around Donald Trump. In particular, what do you say to millennials and what do you say to the veterans?
Well, the millennials are amazing because, and you probably noticed it, so you were there actually.
I have friends that are in the steel industry in steel dynamics, and you were talking about the steel industry. You were talking about the Chinese system. This actually could go to part of what you're talking about when you call the system crooked and rigged is some of our international trade.
Yeah. Well, it's true. A lot of things are rigged. I mean, the whole voter system is rigged. If I weren't winning by as much as I'm winning by, a normal person, a normal campaign could never survive because it's all rigged by the bosses. It's all rigged by special interests who want to keep ripping off the United States. It's a rigged system. I'll tell you, I've never seen anything like it. When you win Arizona by massive amounts, I don't mean close, I don't mean like you win by two votes, you win by a tremendous amount, it's a total landslide, and then you have to fight for voting rights of the stuff that you've won. It's a rigged, it's a totally disgusting rigged system, and the Democrats have it too. They have it more with the Supers and what they're doing with Sanders.
Right.
That's his problem, but I tell you what, this Republican party stuff, it's a disgrace what's goes on, but the good news is we're winning by a lot, so we'll get it and we're going to win. Now they're all predicting that I'm winning, and I hear we're doing very well over here. The whole system, it's beyond even that, and you said perhaps even better than I can say it. The whole system is somewhat rigged. It's hurting children. It's hurting people who want to get a great education because you look at what's going on with colleges and how the cost is going up. The reason it's going up is that young kids go borrow money from the government, and they're like a conduit to the college, so the colleges aren't watching their costs because they're getting money from the federal government so they keep raising their costs disproportionately high. The kids are getting actually killed because they're borrowing so much money to get through college, and then of course, they get out and they can't get a job. Tough stuff.
Yeah, well, I've got millennials that are deep in debt too, so I understand what you're saying. Can I run a headline by you and get some thoughts on the Russian Su-27 that did a barrel roll Friday over the top of the U.S. Air Force RC-135?
Right.
If a guy takes a swing at me enough times in the bar, at some point I at least block the punch. Talk to me about that news story.
Well, I think it's terrible. I watched it, and it just shows how low we've gone where they can toy with us like that. That plane kept going by and these guys are probably sitting there saying what is happening. They work all their lives, they go to Annapolis and they do a good job, but all of their lives they're working to be sailors, to be fighters, to be whatever, and they get taunted like this. Really that's a lack of respect. Now normally Obama, let's say a president, because you want to make at least a call or two, but normally Obama would call up Putin and say, listen, do us a favor. Don't do that, get that maniac, just stop it, but we don't have that kind of a president. He's going to be out playing golf or something. I don't know. At a certain point, you can't take it. I mean, at a certain point, you have to do something. You just can't take that. That is not right. It's against all... You know, when you talk about the Geneva Convention, there's got to be things that are against it. You can't do that. That's called taunting.
Yeah.
It should certainly start with diplomacy and it should start quickly with a phone call to Putin, wouldn't you think?
Well, I would think so, yeah.
If that doesn't work out, I don't know. At a certain point, when that sucker comes by, you're going to shoot. I mean, you're going to shoot, and it's a shame.
Yeah.
It's a shame. It's a total lack of respect for our country and it's a total lack of respect for Obama, which as you know, they don't respect.
I unfortunately am up against a hard break, which means that my time is very tight.
Don't worry. I am too, because I'm going out to Indiana. I'm all over the state today and we're campaigning, but they said this show is a great show. It's a popular show so you must call, so that's why I did it.
I appreciate you doing that. Ladies and gentleman, Donald Trump. Thank you very much, sir.
Thank you. Great honor. Thank you very much.
Joining us now on the phone, the Republican man in command, frontrunner Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, can you hear us?
I can. How are you, Chris?
Yeah. You basically did.
The way she talks about, I can handle men, you know...
You basically did. You said all she's got it that she's a woman.
... who get off the reservation, I think it's a very demeaning statement. Now I won't even bring up the fact that the Indians have gone wild on that statement. You know that, OK. The Indians have said that that statement is a disastrous statement, and they want a retraction. I'm not going to get into that, but that...
You did bring it up. You did just bring it up.
But I think it's a very nasty statement to men, and if I made that statement, it would be a big, big story.
What do you make of the protests that were in Los Angeles yesterday where you had all of these workers there out in the streets, and they were carrying this big balloon with you, like a Thanksgiving Day type balloon, of you as an effigy holding a KKK mask? Those are workers, a lot of them are Latino. It's in California which is, of course, going to be a really important state. What do you say to those people?
I saw nothing other than what I did see is where I was the other day where you had some protests, and frankly...
It's on your screen right now.
... much more easily. And we had 30 -- I'm in Indiana right now. And I was here yesterday, too. Where we had -- oh, now I see it up on your screen. I did not see that. Gee, I hope I look better than that. I did not see that yesterday.
What's your message to them?
I did see -- I did see, Chris -- I did see 31,000 people show up to my rally in Costa Mesa. I did see tremendous crowds at every rally I had three days ago, or two days ago in California. We had 31,000 people. We broke a record, and we brought out the families of people whose children and wives and, you know, husbands were killed by illegal immigrants. Viciously, violently killed by illegal immigrants that came into this country, totally illegally, without documentation, and we had 31,000 people, and it was a love fest. There was not one hand raised in protest. 31,000 people. So I think you're reading the equation wrong, actually. Now, I see...
I'm just asking about what happened in the street. Giving you an opportunity...
If I wanted to, I could have a much bigger parade than that. Believe me.
But what I'm...
And a lot of these people -- a lot of the people -- I can only tell you the people that showed up, because I didn't see that. The people that showed up, a lot of the people that showed up to protest the other day, these were -- thugs, and, you saw what they did to the police car and they wear masks and the police told me, "These are thugs." They show up to different rallies, they wear masks.
There's definitely an element of that. We've been in those crowds before. There are outside agitators, and even if they're not outside, anybody who's doing what's happening on the screen right now is a criminal. That's all it is.
Right.
What's taking place in Orange County, as soon as you do that, protesting or not before, you're now a criminal.
Right. Right.
But I want to give you a chance, what do you say to those people...
Well, I'm getting crowds, Chris -- I'm getting crowds like they've never seen before. You know that. You reported about it.
I totally understand it. Your popular...
You had your helicopter flying over the stadium, it was packed.
What can you say to the...
Because nobody's stronger on trade than me. I mean, our country is being ripped off by China and by every country on trade. I mean, horribly ripped off.
Why is nobody -- Mr. Trump, let me just to explain it for a second.
I mean, horribly ripped off. And I think Bernie Sanders people are going to join my campaign.
How?
And we're going to do something else. We're going to keep jobs in this country.
How?
We're not going to carry out air conditioning, think they're going to move to Mexico, make air conditioners, send them back here, lose all of these jobs.
How?
Pay no tax when they send and hurt our country. So, that's not going to happen.
So, let me ask you something else. Not just the wall. Remember, you have to fill in all the tunnels, also. Because the tunnels are for more of a traffic concern in terms of things getting here illegally than any wall.
Do you know how easy that is for a person of competence? I mean, just fill in the tunnels, Chris, in all fairness.
Well, doesn't -- it's really hard.
I can get people to fill in the tunnels...
Was it funny?
I thought it was fine. I mean, I thought he was fine.
Why didn't you tweet about it? I was shocked.
I thought he did an OK job.
You think you have more experience dealing with...
So, you know, but I don't -- I know he's having fun and he's joking, and I think it's fine. I thought it was fine. I'll tell you the reason I didn't go, though, if you have a second.
Please.
Because I never really expressed this. The time I went where he went after me and then the comedian went after me, I -- I'll tell you what, honestly, I had a great time. And...
Well, let me give you -- let me give you a chance to clean up one thing before I let you go.
The press is a -- hey, look, Chris, it's extremely dishonest. I've gotten used to it, but the press is so dishonest, especially the political press. Like just about -- nothing I've ever seen, can compete with it. It is -- it is a disgrace what happened.
Donald Trump, appreciate having you on the show to make the case to the "New Day " audience. As always, good luck in the primary tomorrow, sir.
OK. Thank you very much.
You gave...
Or we're not going to have a country anymore.
Do you think...
If we're going to leave, keep the oil.
Can you get the Saudis to fight?
But we're going to have to take out ISIS. We have no choice.
Can you get the Saudis to fight? Can you get the Jordanians and the Egyptians to put their boots on the ground, considering it's right in their backyard?
They're going to have to.
There's no doubt...
Sean, if you add it up, it has to be $4 trillion. And most importantly, all of the lives we've lost. Somebody else over there -- I mean, these are the beneficiaries moreso than us. They're going to have to do the fighting. We can help them with air strikes and lots of other things, but we have to get people to do some fighting. But regardless, we have to take out ISIS, have to take it. And also...
There's no doubt, though, the rest of the world has gotten a free ride.
We're going to keep the oil.
All right, we got to take a break...
... we owe right now $19 trillion, and we've got to change the whole formula quickly.
Yes.
And Kasich has only won 1 out of 48 -- I mean, he's won -- I think he's 1 for 48 or 1 for 46, including the islands, including whatever it is.
The territories, yes.
But he's like 1 for something that's massive. And I don't even know, you know, if he -- I don't even know, does he stay or does he not stay? But what's going on? You know, if you look at Kasich, Rubio and Carson and Christie, many people were doing better than him and they decided -- you know, they thought it was maybe for the good of the party or the good of themselves. But certainly, Ben Carson was doing fantastically. These people got out. And Kasich is...
Yes.
I would love to see the Republicans unite because we're going to beat -- you just see the poll that just came out a couple of hours ago, where I'm beating Hillary...
Let me ask about...
... and I haven't even started on Hillary!
Last week...
But I beat all of these people...
Yes. Last week, you...
Yes, go ahead.
All right, Mr. Trump. Thanks for your time, as always. Appreciate it. Good luck Tuesday.
Thank you. Thank you, Sean.
Congratulations.
Good morning.
Hey, Donald, why don't you just admit to everybody you never saw this coming. I mean, you -- you seriously, I mean, you -- you have to be surprised yourself at how this played out.
Well, I'm happy how it played out. I mean I was, you know, against -- we had 17 people. So that was a lot of people. Some people said it was the finest group of talent ever assembled by any party at any time. I was watching that before I announced and I said, wow, what am I doing? And it was talent. I mean, some were very talented frankly. But, you know, it worked out this way so I'm very happy about it.
You brutalized a lot of them. Jeb Bush, low energy. Ted Cruz, Lyin' Ted Cruz. I mean, we could go down the list. How do you now, especially after yesterday, how do you get people like Ted Cruz to endorse you and unite this party? You're talking about uniting the party. Even yesterday you were talking about Lee Harvey Oswald. So how do you turn around unite the party today?
Well, I've gotten a lot of calls from people that were far more brutal than Ted was. And they want to join the team. In fact, I said to them, how can you do that after what you said? They said, don't worry about. That's not a problem. Because they're politicians. You know, it's talk. And I've had calls -- I'll have to tell you about them, but I mean calls really wanting to get on immediately. And this was as of a week ago, even two weeks ago, when it was looking like we were going to do well.
Do you -- Do you care if Ted Cruz endorses you?
Well, I think it would be nice. You know, I've been saying for a long time that there's some people that I almost don't want their endorsement, Republicans, I really don't, because it was too rough and they were too nasty. And I don't think it's going to matter, frankly. It's going to be me. And I am a Republican and I'll do a good job. And I'll do a great job on trade and on the economy, on jobs, bringing jobs back. That's -- you know, I'll do great on the military.
So you think he's holding a grudge?
He never forgot it.
Yes.
And he's a nasty guy, you know, he's a very nasty guy.
Yes.
But I'll have to tell you this. Nobody reads him. He has no influence. If he had influence, I wouldn't be talking to you right now, Joe. Because look, let's face it, I mean, the guy writes a bad column every time he writes a column. I don't know how often he writes them, I don't really know. But -- and the other thing you mentioned, not only George Will there are some others. You look at this guy, Krauthammer, all he does is bash me. He wanted the war. You know, he talked about, oh well, Trump is tough and he may have a fast trigger on nuclear. Let me tell you, I have the slowest trigger there is but I'll prepare our nuclear, because we're not even prepared. But I'll have the slowest trigger.
It seems that way.
Well, Trump, speak of this, a guy like Krauthammer -- I watched him last night and he was talking about Trump would be, may be very quick temperamentally. He's the one that was pushing for years the war in Iraq, which was a total disaster and I didn't want to do it. And, you know, as a civilian I was totally against it. And should have never, one of the worst decisions in the history of our country, by the way, perhaps the worst.
Me too.
And then they talk about me with the fast, so they talk about me with temperament. We need a strong temperament right now. The world is laughing at us. We need a very strong temperament.
Hey, Donald, it's Willie. Congratulations on your win again last night.
Thank you.
I want to ask you a couple of questions about some issues that you've raised during this campaign. A lot of people think you've said some things to win votes in a Republican primary that maybe you actually don't believe and it could change as you go to a general. Do you still believe that Muslims should be banned from entering the country until we can figure out what's doing on, as you've said?
We have to be very vigilant, we have to find out exactly what's going on. We have some major, major problems and nobody wants to talk about it. We have a president that won't mention the term "radical Islamic terrorism." He won't even mention it even though it's obvious that some terrible things are happening. And we have to be extremely careful and we have to be vigilant. Yes, we have to find out what the hell is going on.
So...
And let's see what happens. I mean, this could be a very serious problem for the future. And ifs you look at what's happening all over Europe, with the migration, and look at what's happening. It's terrible what they have done to some of these countries. They've -- they're going to destroy -- I mean, they are destroying Europe. I'm not going to let that happen to the United States.
OK. So as we go to the general, the proposal for the Muslim ban stands. What about what you told Chris Matthews a few weeks ago, which is that women who get abortions should be punished. Do you still believe that to be true?
No, he was asking me a theoretical -- or just a question in theory. And I talked about it only from that standpoint. Of course not. And that was done, they said -- you know, I guess it was theoretically. But he was asking me a rhetorical question and I gave an answer. And by the way, people thought from an academic standpoint and asked rhetorically, people said that answer was an unbelievable academic afterwards. But of course not. And I said that afterwards. Everybody understands that.
... is extraordinarily happy.
He's a great guy, by the way.
They want someone steady, though. I think women voters sometimes see you shoot from the hip in a way that makes them nervous. They want --
Yeah. But actually, I don't shoot from the hip. You know, actually...
Yeah, we'll see how that all shakes out on those various issues, but I want to ask one -- another question about the general. Donald, good morning.
Good morning.
Before you go, I know you've got to run, Donald, but we confirmed last night at NBC News that your campaign has started to vet vice presidential candidates. Who are a couple of the names that you're looking at?
Well, it's too soon. I just don't want to do it. I think that a lot of people are talking about certain names, and certainly those are the names that we're thinking of.
Can you give us one or two?
But I think that I will say that I probably will go the political route. I have the business -- let's call it talents. And I think I'll probably go the political route, somebody that can help me with legislation and somebody that can help me get things passed and somebody that's been friends with the senators and the congressman and all, so we don't have to go the -- so we don't have to go the executive order route as much as Obama did, you know, where he can't get anything approved so he just keeps signing executive orders. But more than likely, I would go the political route.
-- congratulations on what even your sharpest detractors would have to call a truly historic run, unprecedented in our lifetime. It's really incredible. Congratulations.
Thank you very much, Joe. Thank you, Mika.
So, no apology?
I'm just referring to an article that appeared. I mean, it has nothing to do with me. And, you know, the father was very active in the campaign. He said some very nasty things about me in the morning. You know that, and it was reported. And it wasn't nice what he said about me, and I just referred him to articles that were in various periodicals.
Let's talk about other steps you might take to unify the party, including your choice for vice president. Will your vice presidential choice definitely be a Republican?
Yes, that's true.
Will it be an elected official?
Most likely, and it will be probably a person with political experience, because I mean, while I've been in the world of politics all my life, the business, I will handle so well, we will bring our jobs back and we'll bring our economy back. But I do want people to -- I would like to have somebody that could truly be good with respect to dealing with the Senate, dealing with Congress, getting legislation passed, working toward something where we're not signing executive orders every three days like President Obama does.
Will you be writing big checks?
I'll be writing big checks. Yes, I'll be making major contributions to the party.
Mr. Trump, thanks very much for joining us this morning.
OK. Thank you very much, George.
Were you surprised that Ted Cruz dropped out of the race last night?
I was surprised. I did not expect it. I starting hearing rumors in the afternoon, but in the end, look, he was a very tough competitor. He fought very hard, and it was a tough decision for him to make. I think he did the right thing for himself and for the party. But it was a little bit of a surprise to me, yes.
Have you reached out to call him? Has he called you?
I haven't yet. He hasn't. But I would certainly expect to be talking to Ted.
Do you really think, Mr. Trump, that he can put aside all of the things you've said about him and he's said about you and support you?
I really don't know. And that goes for other people, too. I don't know. And you know, I hope so. It would be nice in Ted's case. In other cases, I don't care. In Ted's case, it would be nice. We had a very good relationship, as you know, for quite a long time. In fact, people were a little bit surprised by it.
Right.
And it traveled along. And all of a sudden, you know, I was saying, when is this going to end? And it ended a couple of months ago. And you know, he fought very hard.
Mr. Trump, this is a time that you are trying to unify the Republican Party. Yesterday morning, you went on a morning show and suggested that Ted Cruz's father, Rafael Cruz, may have somehow been involved in, of all things, the JFK assassination. I guess my question to you is why in the world would you do that?
Savannah, I was on a show, and they played a clip of Ted's father, who was very active in the campaign. It's not like he is an inactive person.
But, Mr. Trump, I guess what Savannah is getting at here is, on the morning you had this in your grasp and you were seeing the polls indicating that you were going to win this, and perhaps go on to become the nominee, why take that opportunity at that moment to go back into the gutter?
Well, because I didn't know I had it in the grasp. I mean, I didn't know I was going to win by such a big margin. I won by a massive margin, and the people of Indiana, I'm so thankful to them. But I had no idea early in the morning that was -- the voting booths just starting -- the voting booths were practically not even opened when I made this call. It was a call to a show. And they ran a clip of some terrible remarks made by the father about me. And all I did is refer him to these articles that appeared about his picture. And -- you know, not such a bad thing.
Just in closing here, in just ten seconds I have left, are you fully confident, Mr. Trump, that you can unite the Republican Party behind you?
I am confident that I can unite much of it. Some of it, I don't want. I mean, there were statements made about me that those people can go away and maybe come back in eight years after we serve two terms. But honestly, there are some people I really don't want. I don't think it is necessary. People will be voting for me, they're not voting for the party, and I think we're going to do really well against Hillary. She is a disaster, and she will be a disastrous president.
Donald Trump. Congratulations on the big win in Indiana, Mr. Trump.
Thank you very much.
CNN has confirmed John Kasich, the Ohio governor is dropping out as well. You're the only one left now.
That's good. That's good. You're telling me the first time about John, and that's good. I think John is doing the right thing.
Ohio is an important state. No Republican has ever been elected president of the United States without winning Ohio.
Well, I think John will be very -- I had a good relationship with John.
He has got a lot of government experience, in the Congress as a governor.
I think John would be very helpful with Ohio even as governor.
He says he doesn't want to be vice president.
Well, that could be. I mean, he said that. I'm very sad.
Is he someone you would be interested in vetting?
I would be interested in vetting John. I like John. I have a good relationship with John. I have gotten along with him well. But John would, whether he is vice president or not, I think he will be very, very helpful with Ohio.
Now be honest, did you ever think, almost a year ago, it was June in this building, you were going down that escalator, that you would be the presumptive Republican nominee?
Well, I hoped. I mean, look.
Did you really hope?
Yes, I did. I mean, you have 17 people, very capable people. I heard a lot of pundits who are saying this was the single greatest group of talent ever assembled for either party in terms of a group. It is also the largest group. So I joined somewhat after I heard that statement. I am saying what am I doing, hearing these people --
Did you really think you could win?
I guess, otherwise I don't think I would have done it.
Some thought did you it for publicity, a win, for whatever.
No, I don't need publicity. I mean, I gave up a lot to do it. I was asked to do "the Apprentice " two more years. I said I am not going to do it. I gave up a tremendous amount, and you know, got a little bit controversial for a while. And I lost certain licenses which is, you know, not the biggest deal in my life, but is Macy's didn't want to renew me because they thought I was a little bit controversial, which is I think was a big mistake that they may not very loyal. But you know, it is pretty costly thing when I did not just the cost of the campaign which is frankly less. It is the cost of what I do. Now it has worked out well. I am just very happy with the way it all worked out.
Do you pinch yourself sometimes, say this is really happening?
I don't think I would have run if I thought I couldn't have won. So I'm not going jus to sit there and just said I'm going to win. But subconsciously must have thought that I was going to win and felt I was going to win.
Now in recent weeks and months, you suggested the system is rigged. The Republican system is rigged.
Yes, 100 percent.
You still believe that.
Sure, 100 percent.
You got the nomination.
I don't mind. The only way I got it, I went for the knockout. You know, when I saw these folks going out and getting delegates and, you know, wining and dining people, bringing them to hotels and paying for hotel rooms, it is bad system. It is a crooked system. And by the way, Bernie Sanders' system is also rigged. That's why he wins and he doesn't get anything out of it.
But those are the rules. Those are the rules.
They're not the rules, it is a dishonest system. And who gives out superdelegates in terms of the Democrats? Who gives out superdelegates? The bosses give out superdelegates.
They're elected party officials.
Meaning the bosses. That system is rigged. And the Republican system is rigged but much more in a much more sophisticated way. I really think -- I'm very proud of the fact that after all these many, many decades of the delegate system that I've been able to point out some real weaknesses, and I think they'll be changed. I think for the Republicans they will be changed and maybe for the Democrats.
Yesterday with the national enquirer story. I want you to clarify. You don't really believe that Ted Cruz's father had anything to do with the assassination of President Kennedy.
No, I don't.
Because this is a story that was in national enquirer. Here's the question. You're the presumptive Republican nominee.
No, I wasn't, not then.
Last week you said you were, thought you were.
It was not announced until last night.
The higher standard than to get involved in this stuff?
Here is what happened. Ted Cruz's father, seems like a nice guy, don't know him, seems like a nice guy, he made horrible statements about me, you know, praying for bad things to happen to me, OK essentially. I said that's horrible and I was on a show. One of your competitors, and they showed me the clip, and I said wow, that's horrible. It is not just a one way street where I do something, it was a horrible statement. I was actually surprised by it. And during that and when I said how bad it was that a man would say something like that, I said why don't you read the various magazines because it is not only there, it is there with a picture of himself with Lee Harvey Oswald.
But the National Enquirer put it out.
I am just saying, it was all over the place. I said, well, why don't you talk about that? That was I am not saying he did it. But I am just saying it was all over the place.
But James Comey, the FBI director is a serious guy, you have confidence in him.
Yes, he is.
If he thinks there are allegations that she may have violated or broken the law, he'll recommend that.
I hope so, I hope...
You have confidence in him?
I do have confidence in him. I don't know him, I do have confidence in him.
Let me just clarify, the whole birther thing, where do you stand that now?
I don't talk about it anymore, because every time I talk about it becomes a story. So I don't want to waste my time talking about it anymore.
But she's going to raise this issue against you.
I don't care, it doesn't -- I'm going to raise it against her.
All right, let's talk a little bit about another story.
Go ahead.
These anti-Semitic things.
Well I don't know about that. I don't know anything about that. You mean fans of mine?
Supposed fans of yours posting this at very angry...
You have to talk to them.
You're ready to let Japan and South Korea become nuclear powers?
I am prepared to -- if they're not going to take care of us properly, we cannot afford to be the military and police for the world.
Let's talk about U.S.-Russian relations for a moment. In a past few weeks, on two occasions, Russian fighter jets, you know, barrel rolled U.S. military facility...
Lack of respect.
Lack of respect.
Oh, for the United States...
Have you ever spoken with him?
I don't want to say. But I think I have a good relationship with him. Now I may not. And I'll know pretty quickly. But I would call him, I might say don't ever do it again, don't ever do that again.
But you have seen those pictures?
Yeah, I've seen it, I think it is highly disrespectful to our military, and to our country and to our president.
Let's talk about the U.S. relations with the Muslim world right now, in you foreign policy speech the other day, very details speech, you said you want to work and I'm quoting on, "Very closely with our allies in the Muslim world, all of which are at risk from radical Islamic violence."
100 percent. They have to save themselves. And we can help them, but they have to save themselves.
So how?
They have to put boots on the ground and they have save themselves. Otherwise they're going to be, I won't even say, but bad things will happen.
So how do you work closely with our allies in the Muslim world if you still want this temporary ban on Muslims coming to the United States until the U.S. can figure out what's going on...
We'll have any...
Because I have spoken with a lot of Muslim leaders, King Abdullah of Jordan, who's close friend of the United States as you well know and other moderate Muslim leaders in the Arab world elsewhere.
And a good person, and a good man.
He's a very good person, very good man. Queen Rania is a very lovely...
With friends of my daughter Ivanka.
I'm sure they are. When they hear you talk like that, they get upset, they're Muslims?
I don't know. I mean look I don't know, we have a problem. And I tell you, we have a really big problem where we let in thousands and thousands of people supposedly from Syria, but we have no idea where they're coming from, we have no idea. The migration is a disaster. We're letting in thousands of people, we don't -- they don't have documentation. They don't have paperwork. Nobody knows who they are, where they come from, and they're coming into the country.
So you're speaking with this temporary ban?
Until we figure out what's going on, we have to be very tough, we have to be vigilant, yes.
What about, another sense of issue, Japan, and South Korea. You see just it may be it's time...
It's not sensitive. Not a sensitive issue.
Let them develop their own nuclear arsenal and get the U.S. out of there.
To me it's not a sensitive issue.
Because the other day the U.S. military commander in South Korea General Vincent Brooks, he testified up on Capitol Hill, he said South Korea pays for 50 percent of personnel cost for U.S. troops.
How much percent?
50 percent.
50, why not 100 percent?
So, basically when I hear you saying, if the U.S. and then they'll keep troops in Japan and there's thousands of them, tens of thousands in Korea, 28,000...
We've got to reimbursed.
... in Korea or Germany for that matter.
Yeah.
Do you think some of your former Republican presidential rivals will be on that bigamous?
That could be, it could be, I mean I have lot of respect...
Do the people that said nasty things about you?
Well, you know, I feel differently about that. When somebody says nasty. I don't -- I never like them quite the same.
Are you saying that will change if your president?
They respect our country and they like our country better than they do now.
Let's talk about some for domestic policy issues.
Yes.
American workers. You say they deserve to earn more money, right?
Yeah, yeah, I want them to earn more money.
So Bernie Sanders says he wants $15 an hour minimum wage. And he is really going after you lately for saying you're happy with $7.25, the current federal minimum wage. You can't live on $7.25 an hour.
No. And I'm actually looking at that, because I'm very different from most Republicans. I mean you have to have something that you can live on. But what I'm really looking to do is get people great jobs so they make much more money than that, so they make much money than more money than the $15. Now if you start playing around too much with a lower level -- the lower level number, you're not going to be competitive.
That Hillary Clinton says, she's ready to go to $12...
Is she going?
If you were president, what would you recommend?
No, I'm looking at it, but I don't like...
But they're open to raising the minimum wage.
I'm open to doing something with it, because I don't like that, but what I really like is bring our jobs back so they making much more than the $15.
Because if you want some of those Bernie Sanders supporters out there, I know you want them.
I think I'll get them.
In a general election. Let's say I guess Hillary, your going to have to do something about issues like that.
Well, I told you how I feel. I'm going to bring jobs back to this country. Nobody can do it like I can do it. I understand what's going wrong. Hillary doesn't have a clue, Bernie Sanders is a socialist or more than that, he could be beyond a socialist, and I'm looking, but it doesn't matter...
But you want his supporters?
Yeah, I'm going to get -- I think I'll get a lot of his supporters. Do you know, in the last election that I won in a landslide in New York, the Democrats went in, they all wanted to vote for Trump. The people at the polling booth they said, this is the most incredible thing we've seen, now you couldn't do it because it was a closed system. But Democrats went in and they said to the people that run the polling booth, it was all over television, local television, they said they wanted to vote for Trump. They didn't want to vote for Hillary, they wanted to vote for Trump. When the election comes, they're going to be voting for me.
Give me qualifications you're looking for, for a vice presidential running mate.
Well you always have to say the same boring answer that probably everybody is given you from day one, they have to be a great president potentially have to be a great president. So that's always the number one thing.
But that is the most important fact. You need somebody potentially now, God forbidden for president...
Well if they're for that reason primarily.
Right.
But I would want somebody that would help me from a legislative standpoint getting things passed through Senate, through Congress, and to me that's why I think probably in terms of vice president, I'm going to go the political route, I don't need the business route. I've got that covered.
But somebody has been a governor or senator?
Somebody that -- well somebody maybe that's been even a senator. I mean I like that, because they deal with -- look, we want to get legislation passed, we are a total gridlock in Washington. We can't even take the trillions of dollars that we have overseas back for our companies.
I know you're not going to give me a name, because you have...
I can't give you a name.
... you're going to start vetting people pretty soon, right?
I'm starting to think about it very soon, we'll be vetting people.
You think some of your former Republican presidential rivals will be on that list?
That could be, it could be. I mean...
Even people that said nasty things about you?
Well, you know, I feel differently about that when somebody says nasty, I don't -- I never like them quite the same. But I will tell you, you look at somebody, you know, I'm going to set up a committee. And I may put Ben Carson on the committee, and may put Chris Christie on the committee. They came out early. They were very strong. They're very good people, very good people.
These are people who would vet?
For vetting, yeah, we're going to set up a -- we're going to set up a committee in terms of vice president, we're set up a committee in terms of other positions also.
Hillary Clinton says she's released all her tax returns, you haven't. Are you going to do that?
I will. I really look forward to doing it, but I'm under audit, when you are under audit you just don't do it, any order...
But what about the tax returns have already been audited?
We go -- I go back a long time, because they're called linking returns. If they link. So when I'm under order, I don't want to do it. Now I hope to be able to do it.
So once the audit ends...
By the way, and I tell you what's very unfair...
Yeah.
I have been audited every year for many years, beyond Obama.
Well you make a lot of money.
I do make a lot of money, but I'm audited every year. I have friends that make a lot money that never been audited. I say to friends of mine, how often do you audited? Very wealthy people.
So you think this is political, that there's aiming at you?
I would say, yeah. I mean I would say yeah.
Do you think the general election campaign has already started you versus Hillary Clinton, that for all practical purposes Bernie Sanders is out?
Well, I think what has happened, and there's been a little flip. And I'm not even surprised by it. I thought that I'd be going longer and she'd be going shorter. She can't put it away, just like a football team they can't get the ball over the line. I put it away. She can't put it away. So I thought I'd be out there and she would be campaigning against me. Yeah, I'll be campaigning against her while she's campaigning.
The general election campaign from your perspective starts today.
Essentially, it started, I mean yeah.
Let's talk about women voters out there.
OK.
If you're going to be the President of United States you going to need to do really well with women voters in the general election...
And I will.
Let's talk about the general election, Electoral College strategy going to 270 Electoral College votes. John McCain couldn't do it, as he well Mitt Romney couldn't do it. How are you going to do it? What states are you going to put in play that they couldn't put in play?
That's a question I love, because something I think that I am better served than anyone. First of all, you see how I did in New York. Do you agree I did very well in New York?
Well that's what Republicans in New York...
It doesn't matter.
... there's a lot of Democrats as you remember like. You won basically almost every county in the recent elections, except by the way your own personal home county here in Manhattan.
Which by the way is no one to review and they think I won that, too.
Really?
Yes. It's called Manhattan. But I won every single county in New York, but I won every county in Pennsylvania, every county in Maryland, I won every county in the five states plus New York which pretty good run. And I hear I won every county in Indiana last time.
From New York State, I am from Buffalo, upstate, you'll do well out there. Then the city, you know, New York City, there's a lot of Democrats.
I did very well. It was like a 50/50 deal
Among Republicans. Among Republicans.
Among Republicans, yeah. But I have many...
You're not suggesting New York would be in play.
Oh, I am suggesting New York is in play.
Do you think the general election campaign has already started, you versus Hillary Clinton, that for all practical purposes Bernie Sanders is out?
Well I think what has happened. It is been a little flip, and I'm even surprised by it. I thought I'd be going longer and she'd be going shorter. She can put it away that's like a football team that can't get the ball over the line, I put it away. She can't put it away. So, I thought that I'd be out there and she'd be campaigning against me. I didn't realize, so yeah, I'll be campaigning against her while she is campaigning.
So the general election campaign from your perspective starts today.
Essentially it started, I mean yeah, started today. Started actually three months ago when I hit a pretty hard and she went down the poll.
And your tone is supposedly more presidential or will you really go after her?
Look, you know, I went to the best school, I am a smart person, I did well. You know, I am who I am. I don't like to change. I don't like to really change. Sort of interesting, there was talk about will be presidential. We had 17 people, all smart. One by one, week after week, boom, boom, boom. Gone, gone, gone. I don't maybe want to change so much. And I do want to use that same strategy for trade deals, and I want to use that same but I feel I'm a presidential person.
And that a very impressive that you came out of no political background for all practical purposes and now you're the Republican presidential nominee.
Well, but I always been very heavily involve, in politics. So I haven't been elected, and it has never been my thing frankly and I wouldn't have done at this time. I would be very happy to stay where I was doing. I have a great family, a great company, a really great company, and I love doing it. But when I see the mistakes and the stupidity of what they're doing with our country, the Iran deal, the trade deals, the -- everything is so bad, our military, they can't beat ISIS. When I see what's going on, I said I have to do this.
And right after the convention, you know, there will be three presidential debates let say you against Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders for that matter. One vice presidential debate, you're going to have to start gearing up for the debates.
Well, I'm ready. I mean one of the things that was interesting is that I was never sure of, you know when I hear about debates. I've never debated professionally before, and every single poll, Drudge, who's a great guy. They all have polls, "Time Magazine", they all have these polls. I think it's like an average 7 of them. And they're online polls that take place right after the debate. I won every single poll of every single debate, so I feel good about my debating skills, and again, you know, with something I said I've never done this before stand there and answer formal questions, and...
Hillary Clinton is a pretty good debater.
I think she is. I watched her. I think she is. I really do and I think Bernie is a good debater also.
You'll be ready.
I'll be ready.
Joining us now from his New York City Headquarters is Donald Trump. So I'm a bit confused. For months it was Lyin' Ted, now he is a smart, tough guy. What happened?
Well, I want to be gracious and he was. He was a good competitor. He was very strong competitor and it worked out we had an amazing day as you know in Indiana. We had a tremendous victory. And won all of the delegates in every county. We won everything. And he really competed hard and tough. So I respect Ted.
All right. There is no hard feelings, even though he really gave it to you yesterday. You know what he said about you, I wouldn't run it because it was so nasty. So you forgive him?
No. He said some things and he made up some things and he took things that were said out of context. But, you know, I understand it it's not easy. It's not easy.
All right. So, you won the battle and you're releasing the prisoners. Would you consider Ted Cruz in your administration? Would you consider him for that?
Well, he is certainly a capable guy. So, it's something we can think about. A little bit soon to think about too much. It's just happened less than 24 hours ago. But it's something certainly we would think about.
Have you talked to him?
No, I have not.
Have you talked to Kasich? Kasich dropped out today. Did you talk to John?
No, I have not. He just dropped out a little while ago. No, I have not. Also, we have had a good relationship with him. We will see how that turns out.
Well, you know, he would be a good VP because you are going to win Ohio. If you don't win Ohio, you're not going to win the presidency. Would you consider him for that?
Well, I would certainly consider him. I mean, he is somebody that I have gotten along with during the debates, during intermission I always seemed to be talking to John.
Oh, yes?
So, we will see what happens. But I have a good relationship with him.
OK. That's interesting. Marco Rubio is saying nice things about you and we thought he might be out in the sun a little bit too much because he is in Miami and, you know, it's hot. But, you need Florida. You got to win Florida. Would you consider Rubio as V.P.?
Well, again, I don't want to talk too much about it, Bill, because I am considering a number of people and I think we are going to have a great choice. In the end I haven't made up my mind but we do have a really good -- I would certainly consider him.
You would? OK.
We do have a lot of candidates that I think would be very, very good. Marco and I have gotten along very well.
Would the campaign slogan be vote for big Don and little Marco? No. That wouldn't work.
No. I think it would be vote to make America great again. Maybe we'll go that way.
OK. You put Ben Carson in charge of your search committee for V.P., I understand. Do you know what happened when Bush put Cheney in charge of search committee, Cheney got to be V.P. Is that possible here?
I don't think Ben is looking for that. Ben is a terrific guy. He is a friend of mine. He gave me a very warm endorsement very early on.
Yes.
And he has been so helpful. He was making calls and doing everything he could, making speeches, doing a lot of television. He is a terrific guy. Dr. Ben Carson a terrific guy.
Now, you know how presumptuous I am and obnoxious I am. You know that. You know me a long time.
That's true. I do. Absolutely true.
And I said last night, yes, and this isn't going to surprise you what I'm about to say to you. I said last night that I believe before you get to Cleveland you are going to try to consolidate the Republican establishment support by doing the following, appointing Rudy Giuliani the Homeland Security chief. Appointing Governor Christie the Attorney General, and Ben Carson in charge of Health and Human Services. I said I think that Trump's going to do that. Would I be wrong?
Well, I have not made that decision but certainly they would be three very wise choices. I think they would be popular but more importantly I think they would do a phenomenal job all three of them. No, I haven't, you know, thought about that. But I will tell you all three would be very good choices and very good positions for themselves. I think it would be good.
But it's the timing of it, would you do it before you went into Cleveland so you would have like a squad you're coming in with?
I like the idea of doing some of this before we go into Cleveland, yes. I could do that and I think it would be well received.
All right. Now, tone, tone, if history is any barometer, the Clinton campaign will go after you through surrogates. Move On, these sleazy left wing websites are going to tear you up. Are you going to respond to that if Hillary Clinton takes the high road and doesn't do any of that?
Well, I'm going to be able to figure it out. I mean, we have had 17 people just now and I figured that out and I will be able to figure it out with Hillary. It depends on where she is coming from. If she wants to go the low road, I'm fine with that. And if she wants to go the high road, which probably I would prefer, I would be fine with that.
All right. Wait, wait, wait, but, wait, you're fine with the low road? Most people don't want to go on the low road?
No, I can handle the low road if I have to do it. I mean, we've had some low roads over the last few months.
Really?
I'm fine with it if we have to go that direction.
All right.
Maybe you haven't noticed.
All right. So you wouldn't hesitate if Putin defied you and would you make that call public? Would you tell the American people listen, I called old Vlad, and I told him to knock it off. Would you tell us that?
I might do that and I might not. But I would be very strong. And I would say, do not do that. That's provocation, that's something that you are not just supposed to be doing.
Right. But if he did, if he defies you, you would have to shoot one of those planes down.
I may have to do something which you would hate to do. But this is something I wouldn't want to do. But I would say Vladimir, don't do it. Let's go. Come on. We're going to have a good relationship. Don't do it.
Now, there is going to come a point if you are elected president that somebody is going to call your bluff. You know that.
Sure.
Now, you had to go in the back way in one of California's speeches because they disrupted outside. They were threatening, I think you're going to have to deal with some of that stuff. Have you thought about how you are going to deal with people who get overly aggressive?
Oh, I think we will deal with it just fine, Bill. That was not a big deal. I did something that worked actually very well. I went in. I did a speech. I went out. And that was actually for the Republican committee. I did that.
Right.
That wasn't one of my events. That was for somebody else. But it was -- I mean, not a big deal other than there were helicopters all over the place following me. I felt like O.J. Simpson. I left the plane. I was in this van and we were being followed by helicopters all over the place. The fact is that that was not really a big deal.
All right. Vicente Fox coming up later on the program. You got any message for the former president of the Mexico?
Yes. Get your money ready because you are going to pay for the wall.
You are not backing off that, right?
No. Of course not. Lock, we lose a fortune with Mexico. Trade deficit $58 billion a year. The wall is going to cost 10. Believe me, they will be able to afford it and we are going to end up having a very good relationship with Mexico. But right now sadly, like everybody else, they're taking advantage of our country on trade and at the border. So we'll get it straightened out.
Yes. And it's a very difficult thing for all political families. You know, to absorb the slings and the arrows that obviously are going to come your way in the months leading up to November. We really appreciate you coming on, Don. We know how busy you are. And it's always interesting to talk with you. And we hope we can continue this through the election. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much, Bill. Thank you.
I am joined now by Donald Trump in his office, good to see you, and congratulations --
Thank you very much, thank you Lester.
Did you hear from Ted Cruz today?
I did not. I did not. I didn't call him --
How about John Kasich?
I have not spoken to him. I've gotten along with him, we'll see how that goes. But I have not spoken to him.
Sounds like an urgent problem. Is that the first 100 days --
Well, that is an urgent --
Yes --
Unless, you're going to try and do something about it, you're never going to solve the problem.
So, Clinton, will he be fair to this?
If they are fair with me, I'm going to be fair with them, otherwise he becomes part of it.
But there's nothing in those returns, do you think that might make your supporters raise an eyebrow?
No --
Donald Trump, that's all the time we have, thank you so much --
Thank you --
For your time --
Thank you very much --
For talking to you and --
Thank you --
Even frenemies with a few, I'm sure. That's...
Yeah.
If the veep selection hadn't become front and center, I guess our first question here is always about the economy, Donald.
Yeah.
Bob Doll has a question for you.
Hi, Bob.
Hi, Mr. Trump. You know -- allowing you to put an exclamation point on all of that. Seems to me that part of our problem is we're just not growing fast enough and we would solve a lot of problems if we could grow faster. Jobs, income inequality, etcetera...
Right.
Yes.
Well, these are people that are -- have been, you know, they've been disenfranchised. They're smart, they're hard-working, but they've been disenfranchised. And that's what's going on.
We heard Lou Holtz -- yeah. I mean, yeah.
Lou. By the way, Lou Holtz was great.
Genius.
We had, you know, Katie from the Purdue team.
Right.
I probably would rather run against her. I think it would be a more exciting race.
Right.
She did as much as you can possibly do on that front, and she's going to skate away with it. And it's a disgrace, OK. But, that's the only thing that's going to stop her if the system is honest and if the Democrats don't protect her. Otherwise she is going to win the -- she is going to win the nomination over the next month or so because he can't win.
Right.
It is such a crooked system. And again, she is fighting -- he is fighting Crooked Hillary. So whether I want to go against him or her, it doesn't matter. I will say this. She, I think, in a certain way, will be easier to beat because she has got so much baggage.
Mr. Trump, I agree with you. And it's a huge dilemma that we face, that we talk about just about every day here on the show.
Tremendous dilemma.
Right.
When the prime rate went up to, what, 21 or 22 percent, Becky, right?
Right.
And it was -- I watched that whole deal. That was not a pleasant deal for a lot of people.
Yeah.
As we had our beautiful prime deals, our solid prime deals, all of a sudden, we're paying 21 percent interest, right?
Mr. Trump, the lead story in The Wall Street Journal today is about 2017 and what kind of premium increases all of these private insurers are going to need after losing a lot of money in 2016 because of the Affordable Care Act.
Yeah.
But Mr. Trump, are you suggesting that we would -- we would negotiate with the U.S. credit in such a way?
Say it again?
Are you suggesting -- I mean, I understand that you've done this in business deals, but are you suggesting we would negotiate with the U.S. credit in such a way? Because...
No. I think this. I think there are times for us to refinance. We refinance debt with longer term. Because you know, we owe so much money. It's so -- nobody talks about it. Nobody talks about it until the bubble pops. And the bubble could pop. And it could pop and it could be ugly.
Yeah.
You have seen it a couple of times, but you haven't seen it as bad as it could be, as bad as it was you haven't seen. And I could see long-term renegotiations, where we borrow long-term at very low rates. Frankly, we need -- you know, we do need money to rebuild the infrastructure of our country.
You -- this is an example, I think, Mr. Trump, and Andrew pointed it out, this is not something that's front and center on a lot of far-right conservatives in terms of interest rates. And you've never -- you haven't run this entire campaign based on currying favor with the establishment, with the base of the Republican Party. Is this going to be -- you're not going to tack to the right to try to garner more -- I don't know -- more support from that part of the...
No. Hey, Joe...
Right. Because that could have made the -- he's still winning. He's winning without talking about that. But -- so do you think you learn more to attack her with from that primary campaign, or do you think, you know, you had 17 guys going after you. I bet you they have some sound bites ready to run.
Well, sure they do. And you know, it's -- hey, I have had now -- it came out the other day -- 66,000 -- would you believe this -- 66,000 negative ads on me during the course of the...
Mr. Trump, before we let you go, you were talking about marketing and advertising earlier. I don't know if you saw a headline overnight from The Rolling Stones, the band, saying they don't want you using their songs anymore during your speeches on the way in and out. What do you have to say to Mick Jagger about that?
Oh, I have no problem with it. I didn't see that. But certainly I have no problem. I like Mick Jagger. I like their songs. But we can use -- you know what, we use so many songs. And by the way, we have the rights to use them. I always buy the rights to...
Right.
But you know, Ted has not had great support from his fellow senators. He's had very little support. Jeff Sessions backed me, Senator Jeff Sessions, who's -- of Alabama -- who is a fantastic man, by the way.
Would he make a good veep?
Senator Jeff?
Yes.
I think he would make a good anything, if you want to know the truth. He is an unbelievable person. He is beloved in Alabama. He is totally respected by every senator. And actually, I think he is the man that Ted Cruz respects the most in the United States Senate. I mean, he talked about him all the time. And then he came out and endorsed me. And I said, wow, that was great.
That was amazing. But did he -- you might...
But he is a fantastic guy.
Yes.
I mean, he said it's the single greatest phenomenon in politics in his lifetime that he's ever seen. You know, what's happened here with this whole situation. And I don't know why. Joe knows me well. Joe, we like to win, right? We sort of expect to win. But you never know. But a lot of people have said that. It's a great phenomenon what's taking place. And I don't see it that way, but a lot of people do.
We've seen that, yes.
I have to say before I get off, though, you mentioned Supreme Court.
Yes.
And I will tell you, if somebody isn't there to do that and to counter-balance what's going on -- it's so important. And it's going to be a country that you won't recognize in ten years.
We have one of those guys on the other day. That's right. He was in...
No.
They're not coming around.
Well he came...
Yes.
I will tell you it didn't matter.
Yes, he told a slightly different story. We had him on the air. He said that you reached out to him, saying you were thinking about funding him.
Oh, come on.
That was the story when he was here.
Becky, I've never even heard of these people, OK? I never even heard -- I'll send you a copy of his letter asking me for the extortion money OK?.
He admitted that he wrote the letter. He claimed it was after you offered to fund him. I am just telling you what he said on the air.
He must absolutely be kidding, all right. I guess that's all he can say. Hey, maybe I should have paid the money, I would have gotten positive instead of negative. But in the meantime, they took millions of dollars of negative ads against me and I beat them in landslides every time. So, what difference does it make?
Right. All right. You know, I don't know. Trump Tuesday. Has a nice ring to it. Trump Tuesday on Tuesday. Anyway...
Well you guys have been fantastic. I watch you all the time. It's an honor to do your show. And you know, when you're ready we'll do another one.
Excellent.
It's been very interesting.
All right, thanks for all your time.
Thank you. Thank you all very much.
Well, congrats first of all.
Thank you.
We haven't sat for an interview in about six months but I don't think you've had a hard time getting on.
No. We've had no trouble getting on television. That's the good news. But it's been a great period of time. And indiana was so overwhelming. It was such a great experience for me. And amazing and Bobby Knight helped. There's no question about that. He was -- but we won, it was a big election for me.
I want to talk about clear up some things and then talk about kind of general election themes going forward. First of all, the scuttlebutt obviously is who you're going to pick as VP. Everybody is asking you about it. And I heard you say over the past 24 hours that it's going to probably be a person with political experience. Somebody that can work with the Senate and the House. Current or a former?
Well, I say, you know, perhaps current, could be former. But I think somebody with political experience that really has a close relationship with the Senate, with Congress, with -- where they go in and help so we don't have to sign executive orders like President Obama does every hour. It would be nice to actually get something passed, as opposed to just saying, we're signing it anyway. And I think, you know, we have some people that are very good candidates. I'm looking at some wonderful people. Some were on the stage with me and some are not.
There's a report out that you were down to Nikki Haley and Suzannah Martinez.
No, Nikki Haley. No. Nikki Haley, no. She wasn't under consideration. Isn't, really, she's very fine. But she's not under consideration. But I'm looking at a lot. I'm looking at quite a few.
And you had conversations with Marco Rubio recently. Several of them.
We've had really nice conversations. Not necessarily about that, just that -- you know, we always had a very good relationship. Marco and I. And then it got a little bit nasty for a period of time. And then we had the election and you know, that was a tough period of time for Marco. Marco is a good guy. A really nice guy. And I like him. But not necessarily with respect to any position. But it could happen.
Do you think he would say yes if you asked him?
Well, not necessarily to that one, but even that one. I've had a really good relationship with him for a long period of time. We had a little rough period for about a month.
A little is a good word.
A little bit rough. But you tend to forget that. You tend to forget. Especially if you win you tend to forget it. But Marco has been very supportive. Very good. And you know he said very nice things.
Well, speaking of that, you have Dr. Ben Carson heading up your vice presidential selection?
I do. And somebody who I have a lot of respect for. A great guy. You know, just a great guy. I've gotten to really know him much more so. He called up and he wanted to be part of the team. Long time ago. He's been with me a long time. And goes out and makes speeches, everybody loves him.
I mean, Carson, this is a guy who's heading up your VP committee. You called him pathological at one point.
Well, no, I didn't --
No, no, he said that, you --
I just repeated his book.
You said, I don't want a person that's got pathological disease, I don't want it.
I talked about his book.
Yes.
And he talked about his book. And he -- and he doesn't, because if you really read that statement, read what he is, I think -- I think it's pretty understandable when you read the book. But he is really a fine person, he's just a person I've gotten to like.
So you --
And he said it -- and it was on tape. And your friends at "FOX AND FRIENDS" played it. And Steve and Brian, the group, they played it. And I must tell you I was shocked to see it. I didn't see it until then. And they said, what do you -- I said, I think it's a very nasty thing, it was a very nasty thing to say. So it wasn't just -- it didn't come out of nowhere.
Sure.
And I had seen a week before -- actually all over the place that there was a picture of the father, who seems like a nice guy but after what he said about me, it's a little bit tough. And he was having lunch or breakfast with Lee Harvey Oswald.
Yes. They're not sure that that was him. Even the expert didn't say it was. But listen, you --
They didn't dispute that. They didn't dispute that.
"National Enquirer."
And it was picked up by a lot of people. And I don't think anybody denied it. Now they may have denied it recently, and all I did was say, well, what about that? I mean, I'd like somebody to explain that.
Yes.
Now that doesn't mean there's not an explanation.
All right.
I'm sure there is.
And I know you've heard this.
What about that?
That you have a nominee now, presumptive nominee.
OK.
On the email issue, you saw the story about a hacker speaking out, this Guccifer guy who apparently hacked into Hillary Clinton's emails.
Yes.
You said you were going to reach out to Bernie supporters.
Yes.
Because you think you can get some of those voters.
I think I can.
Will you be reaching out to conservatives like you've announced you're reaching out to Bernie Sanders?
Well, I pretty much have conservatives, other than some people that want to get publicity for themselves. I mean, some of the people that want to get publicity that I've defeated, you know, I've defeated them. And it wasn't a pretty picture. Maybe they're not used to being spoken to that way. But whatever it is, it worked, and that's what we have to have for our country. But most of these people are defeated people. And they've held a grudge.
Clearly there are people in the Republican Party who are not on your side. You have to acknowledge that. Senator Ben Sasse from Nebraska -- -
Who I've never met. Who I never know.
I know. But you've had a Twitter back and forth a little bit.
Here's a guy, I watch him on television, know nothing about him. He knows nothing about me.
Before the convention.
Actually I've met with a couple of Heritage and a couple of groups. I think before the convention yes, I want to put up 10, 12, 15 names of the type of people that we'd like. I would like to do that.
And that would be -- from that list that you will choose?
Yes. And I've suggested that. I don't know if it's been accepted. But from that list, I would choose, he's a conservative judge, these would be great judges.
You have now two -- the last two Republican presidents saying they are not going to endorse you.
Well, I understand that, and I understand why they're not. The war in Iraq was perhaps the worst decision ever made in this country's history. It totally destabilized the Middle East. It was a total disaster, it was made by Bush. I took Jeb Bush on very hard. He was very nasty to me, spent $15 million, $20 million on negative ads on me, you know, nobody mentions that. They just say I was very nasty to him. Well, I was, you know, I came up with a low-energy individual. He -- you know, whatever. Whether he is, I mean, I think he is. But it was a tough fight. He fought hard, I fought hard. He got out of the race. That was it.
So you think their decision has to do with Jeb Bush?
Of course it does. I criticized his decision to go into Iraq.
Now on that, as I just want to clear that up. You've come up with articles. But there's audio of you before the war --
No, there isn't. No, there isn't.
There's a BuzzFeed piece that has --
Let me just say -- yes, I'm talking to Howard Stern.
Yes.
Weeks before. First time anybody ever -- you know, I was a civilian. First time anyone ever asked me about the war, about should we go in because there was the question, are we going in? And I said very weakly, well, blah, blah, blah. Yes, I guess.
And then on the first day of the war --
Then by the time --
You said that it's a tremendous military success.
No, what I said, what I said is, it was a success, because they thought it was a success. But before that, I said they shouldn't go in. And then all during, for many years, I said this war is a huge mistake. In fact in 2003, 2004, they did an article, a big article in one of the magazines and Reuters did an article where I'm very critical of the war, get out, it's a mistake.
Well, today you've announced your national finance chairman.
Right.
And he's an ambassador, a former partner of Goldman Sachs.
Right.
There will be people who say oh, he's buying into the big money.
He's raising money and he's been a very successful guy, young guy, smart, very sharp. Wants to do this, feels very committed. But he's raising money for the party. He's raising money for the Republican National Committee.
But you're going to take donations.
I'm going to take -- what I'm doing is I'm going to be putting up a lot of my own money. He's raising money for the party. So he's really doing that as a joint venture with the party. But I'm going to be spending a lot of my own money. I'm going to keep it going. I don't know. I mean, so far I've spent probably $45 million or $50 million by the time the primaries are over. And that's substantially less than what other people have spent and they've been sitting home for two months.
That's true. A couple of policy things. I had a member of parliament on the show recently. Pushing for Brexit. The Great Britain exit from the EU.
OK.
Where do you stand on that?
I think the migration has been a horrible thing for Europe. A lot of that was pushed by the EU. I would say that they're better off with it personally but I'm not making that as a recommendation. Just my feeling. I know Great Britain very well. I know, you know, the country very well. I have a lot of investments there. I would say that they're better off without it. But I want them to make their own decision.
Puerto Rico, there's a battle on Capitol Hill about restructuring its debt.
Right.
Campaigning in Iowa, you said, quote, I know more about ISIS than the generals do, believe me. You obviously know a lot about leadership. But based on this, what's your assessment of the leader of ISIS? His strengths, weaknesses, you know?
Well, they've had numerous leaders and they don't -- we don't even really know who the leader is, Bret. You have different people in different areas. What does amaze me is that they have a leader and that we can't get him. I mean, it's unbelievable. But you have more than one leader of ISIS, and they're expanding and they're spreading and now they've taken over the oil in Libya, which is really pure, great oil. That's among the best in the world and they're sending it out on ships and we're doing nothing to blockade it.
So if we took out al-Baghdadi, would you say that decapitation would kill ISIS or another leader would just pop up?
No. No, another leader would pop up. I think it's been proven. I mean, we've knocked out leaders all over the place and somebody else comes up. Now he may be a great leader. But it just seems to be a great leader, every time we take out one of their leaders, you know, there's no difference.
And you have a plan?
I have a plan. You would have to hit them very hard. We have to knock ISIS out. We have an obligation to the world to knock them out. If Russia wants to help us, when they were dropping bombs on ISIS and I heard different people like Lindsey Graham upset that Russia is getting involved, I said why, is it wrong that -- I mean, whoever wants to get involved, we have to get them involved.
You were --
But this is a threat. This is a threat that we have to get rid of.
About Russia, you were asked yesterday if you've ever spoken to Vladimir Putin. And you said, I don't want to say.
Yes, I have no comment on that. No comment. I was in Russia --
But one of the things people like about you is to answer any question.
Yes. But I don't -- let's assume I did. Perhaps it was personal. You know I don't want to -- I don't want to hurt his confidence. But I know Russia well. I had a major event in Russia two or three years ago. Miss Universe contest which was a big, big incredible event, an incredible success.
OK. So we can say you talked to him.
No. I got to meet a lot of people. And you know what? They want to be friendly with the United States. Wouldn't it be nice if we actually got along with somebody?
Do you think on some issues you're going to come to the left of Hillary Clinton on foreign policy?
No. I think I'm much tougher than her on foreign -- and I think we won't have to use it. I'll be honest. You know, I hear that I might may be to the left. I believe in very, very strong defense. I believe in world peace. I want to help other countries.
You're going from running in the primary to eventually running in the general election.
Right.
How many of your policy issues you've talked about on the trail do you think will evolve in that transition to a general election nominee?
Well, I think that what I will be really talking about a lot will be illegal immigration. But I think in order will be the economy, number one, and jobs and good trade deals because that's ultimately part of the economy. I mean, the economy and trade deals are a part because we're losing so many jobs because of our crazy trade deals, including NAFTA.
Congressman Chris Collins from New York endorsed you, he's a member of your congressional leadership team. You know he's against mass deportation of illegal immigrants. He's against a temporary ban on Muslims. He says that when you become the nominee, and then his idea, when you become president, that you are going to be more nuanced than you are on the trail. What do you say to that?
Well, we're going to see -- I mean, I have to see. Look, everything honestly is going to be up and we have to negotiate, we have to see. I can't make these decisions myself. We have Congress --
You've been very clear on the stump that you oppose any reform of Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security.
Yes.
Yet you told The Washington Post you would eliminate $20 trillion of U.S. national debt in eight years.
No, no, I -- I think what they really are referring to, I'm very good at understanding banking, debt, I'm one of the all-time professionals. OK? We can cut. We can discount, we can buy a discount, we can see where interest rates are.
Negotiating with Paul Ryan on his plan.
Right.
The Candidate Casino is shut down. But you have all black chips from Charles Krauthammer and Steve Hayes and everybody else.
That's hard to believe. I think I'm going to take a picture. Could I take a picture of that?
Yes.
Make sure you send me of these guys with the old chips, right down on the 100s. Right?
Thank you for the time.
Thank you very much. Appreciate it.
Mr. Trump, thank you very much for joining us at Breitbart News Daily.
Thank you Steve, how are you?
Doing great, sir, listen Paul Ryan, was he actually trying to insult you, because they didn't reach out to you, or was he trying to insulting what is it the nine or ten million voters? I mean our phones are lit up this morning with people saying, "Hey, the message has been very clear on trade, it's very clear on immigration, it's very clear on the wall, it's very clear what we want on restrictions of Muslim immigration, at least temporarily" -- seventy percent you know the exit polls of Republican voters. Did he show a lack of respect for not just you but for your followers?
I don't know what he was doing. I was surprised. I see that Darrell Issa endorsed yesterday and Rick Perry endorsed and we had tremendous endorsements yesterday. I guess John McCain endorsed, it looks like it. So many people endorsed yesterday and then all of a sudden out of the blue comes this situation and I was actually very surprised by it if you want to know the truth.
You got no heads up, no staff to staff, nobody saying "hey" --
No we had no heads up. And I will say, you know he just made the statement I think on CNN and I will say -- you you said it better than I can say it -- we have millions and millions of people that have voted in the Republican primaries, more than they had four years ago, it's the talk of the world in terms of political and you know millions of people and as you know I set the all-time record for getting votes and here we are having somebody that did that. So I was very very surprised, but I like him, but the fact that he would do that, and he's doing it under the banner of unity but in actuality that's the opposite of unity. I've also had many people say that I'm better off, but I don't believe that, I think we should have unity. I think it would be better to have him, but you know I -- it's just too bad. Many people think I'm better off, who knows.
But don't they -- anyone, his unity is he goes to core values, he wants you to drop your positions on trade, he wants you to drop your positions on the wall, he wants you to drop your positions on bringing jobs back from China, he wants you to drop your philosophy about slowing down Muslim immigration temporarily until we get our hands on it, that's what they -- what he wants is for you to drop those policies. Are you prepared to do that for unity?
Well I'll tell you what, when you look at what's happened with our party, and when you look at the fact that I've won every election with landslides, I mean there was a reason that all these people got out, they got out because you know every time we went to a primary and whether it was New York or Pennsylvania or Connecticut or Maryland, I mean you see what's been happening, I'm winning by 30 and 40 points and nobody's ever seen anything like it. It's landslides and so every single every single primary that I've had, every single state has now been won in massive numbers and they know what I'm saying and they know what the party's saying and the reason they're voting for me is because they agree with what I'm saying.
We looked and it was three years ago I think this week on May first up in Nashua, New Hampshire the day Bossie put on a really an event for the Tea Party and you came and spoke at it. Mike Lee was there, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, it was the first time we interviewed you, for 30 minutes. I remember the mainstream media, the New York Times, CNN, MSNBC didn't take you seriously at the time and --
Who knew this was going to happen, Steve? You did, but there weren't too many people that got it. You got it. I must say to your listeners, you got it earlier than just about anybody.
Well here, it was quite simple in looking at that crowd in Nashua as we went around the country looking at people, people were leaning in when you were talking, and you're talking the same topics today: trade, immigration --
Yup, I'm very consistent.
Chutzpah, chutzpah.
I will tell you I learned how great these people are, how loyal they are. The people are so loyal to me and you've known that, I mean you've seen that for a long time, you know the loyalty factor to me is far greater than to anybody else that ran, by a lot. They did polls, believe it or not they even polled that. But I've also learned that our country's in trouble. You go to upstate New York and you go to Pennsylvania and you go to Connecticut and all these different places and you see empty factories all over the place you see empty factories like you wouldn't believe. I've never seen anything like it. As a real estate person I said wow, I could probably buy that building for three dollars. You know it -- I mean as a real estate person, as a person that gets it from a business standpoint it's so sad to see. And what did it was NAFTA. And other things, and bad you know very stupid trade policies, but NAFTA is a disaster. And who signed NAFTA, Bill Clinton. NAFTA is a disaster.
But here's the thing, OK, our callers and listeners are split, you know they've always been heavy Trump and heavy Cruz. The Trump people want to know, for unity, are you not prepared to give up what they backed you on from the beginning? Because when they hear Paul Ryan talking unity, what they feel feel is gonna be a collapse of what you ran on and a collapse of what they backed you on.
Well you can't do that. Look I ran on strong borders. I ran on really great trade deals and not you know -- and by the way I'm for free trade. If he likes free trade that's fine but we can't make good free trade deals. We're not -- we're getting killed at every level. Now one of the reasons we're not doing well with free trade is because we have lousy negotiators and lousy leaders, but -- cause I do believe it you know I've always told you, free trade, the problem is it's not working for us because the deals are so bad so we have to go to another --
Clinton Cash, yeah, Peter Schweizer's book.
That was a an amazing book and unfortunately it seems to have disappeared, people aren't bringing it up. That was an amazing book actually, he really covered the web you know what was done for this and that and I don't know, I don't seem to be hearing about it so much anymore, and Bernie has not used that book. But that was an amazing book in terms of the complexity of what they've done and the dishonesty of what they've done.
Do you think that they're they're they're what used to be called influence peddlers, that they sell their vote, they sell access?
Do I? Yeah I I do, I do, I think so. I think if you read that book you'll see it, you know where so much money is given for given for speeches and all of a sudden some countries you know a big beneficiary or whoever paid for the speech, oh yeah I think so, I thought it was obvious. It just seems that that book was so good and so on point and so legit and then all of a sudden it disappeared it shouldn't be disappearing.
Well we're gonna -- there's an announcement that there's gonna be a big film made about that book and so we'll make sure that you get full access cause we want we want Bernie Sanders and we want Hillary and we want Bill Clinton to see the film and review the book and all the good Peter Schweizer's wanted to --
I'm surprised that Bernie Sanders is not going after her tougher to be honest with you, I'm very surprised.
Do you think he could beat her if he went after her on her corruption?
Well it's a you know it's a crooked system. I mean you look at the superdelegates and he's winning so many of these races and they say he has no chance and it's a crooked system. And you know what it was a rigged deal even for me but I was winning by so much you know I was like a prizefighter, you knocked out the opponent you'd have to worry about the judges. But I mean for a while there it was ridiculous, I'd win a state and I'd lose the delegates because these guys are wining and dining the delegates and even though they came in fourth place.
When are you --
It's a crooked system.
When is your apparatus going to turn and totally focus on the Clintons in the fall campaign? I saw --
It is already turned. I mean it has absolutely turned. It's -- we're focused.
Mr. Trump, thank you so much for taking so much time --
Thank you very much, Steve, it's an honor.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Good morning.
Good morning.
So that's why the Bushes aren't involved.
But yet -- and yet...
Yes, I was going to ask you that. Does it even matter? Because the reason you're doing so well and have done so well is because of your anti-establishment and the voters are getting behind you for that reason.
Well, many people think it's a very good thing, but I don't. I think it's not a good thing. I think it's something that the party should get solved quickly and I know we're meeting next week, but...
You and Paul Ryan?
We're meeting next week.
What are you going to talk to him about?
They wanted to meet next week. I have absolutely no idea.
So the campaign is really...
We win all these landslides and that's why people really decided they better get out. And that's the thing. I mean, when you're looking for unity, is winning too. We have to win.
Yes, well you...
And -- go ahead.
Well, it does sound like they're starting to talk to them. So, while she was out in Los Angeles getting a bad reception from a number of protesters, on Cinco de Mayo, you tweeted out an image of you there at Trump towers with a taco bowl talking about how you were having that and they make really good ones at the Trump grill there in your building.
They do.
After you posted that, Robert Zimmerman who is a Hillary surrogate and a DNC committee member said...
Flunky. He's a flunky, go ahead.
Yeah.
So, we're going to bring jobs back to America. And you know, that's -- and there's nobody who can compete with me on that. Hillary can't compete. She doesn't know what she's doing.
All right. Any word on who you're looking at to be your vice president? Who's on the short list?
Well, I -- I'm looking at a few people. I will be looking at more. I do get a kick out of it. I won't mention names, because I don't want to embarrass anybody.
Mr. Trump, I know you're considering a lot of different people. Would you rule out or rule in a Democrat -- the right kind of Democrat?
I would rule them out. Or her out.
For you.
... we'll see what happens.
Real quickly before you go. Of course, you're talking about the opponents who are now supporting you. Have you talked to Ted Cruz yet since Tuesday?
I have not. At some point I will. I have not. He -- you know, look, it was a rough campaign, let's face it. It was rough. So I have not.
Hi, Mr. Trump.
Hello, Shawn.
Hi. I wanted to ask you about your father, Fred's death in 1999. You wrote in The America We Deserve that his death had a profound effect on you and made you see your obligation to rebuild the world and make it a better place. I just want to ask you briefly, did your dad's death have any influence on your decision to go into politics?
Well, my father was my best friend. I had an amazing relationship with my father, and I have a very good relationship with my siblings, very, very good. But my father was my best friend. We worked at business and we got along, and then I moved to Manhattan and left the Brooklyn office, but my father was a special man to me. He taught me much. He was just great. don't know, Shawn, that I could exactly say that it was specific as to why I'm doing what I'm doing right now. We had a good night last night, as you probably heard, but why, in Oregon. But why I'm doing what I'm doing right now? I think what he taught me and maybe my love for him had a lot of influence on things I do even if it's not knowingly.
OK.
If that makes sense.
We heard it all.
I said hello and I got no answers. Male Voice: Yeah. We got it all.
Was it because you wanted to vote in Democratic primaries or you wanted to potentially run as a Democrat in the city?
Well, I said to myself if I ever ran for anything in New York, which I thought about, you virtually can't get elected as a Republican. It's very, very hard to run for political office. And if I did -- now, I had no plan to run, but it was something that, you know, I think about every once in a while and I said if I ever did that, being a Republican is very, very difficult in New York. So I thought my views have changed a little bit since then, but generally speaking I would just say that New York is largely Democrat and that was the reason I switched.
OK. Mr. Trump, this is Amy Goldstein. It's good to meet you by telephone and thank you for your time.
Hello, Amy.
You just said to us that you built a great company. We've been taking a look at your company back in the time, the bankers were very easy about lending money.
That's true. That's beyond true, Amy.
Right. But you said yourself in an ad you took out a long time ago in New York Magazine that you had paid too much for the Plaza Hotel which you wanted for historic and artistic reasons.
That's true.
And people familiar with the airline industry said that you paid too much for the Shuttle. And obviously, you ended up over, you know, a couple of years defaulting and missing a lot of interest and principle payments. So even if the bankers were very willing to lend you all that money, did you feel a sense of responsibility about the fact that you were in a situation in which you were missing these payments or it was no big deal that you were missing them?
No. I actually, on The Plaza, went to the banks and they gave me more money than I paid. On the airline, as you know, they gave me beyond what I paid.
Yes, that's correct.
I used to call it free money, and that was a time -- and there were great tax benefits to that also, which people don't understand, but there were tremendous tax benefits. Tremendous, beyond tremendous. And so buying The Plaza -- and I Plaza, I was able because they had somebody, one of the banks had a very big client from the Middle East that they wanted to make very happy. And because of the fact that I agreed to do it because -- I could have held up that sale for years. I could've held it up very easily for years. And because of the fact that they were so anxious to satisfy that very big Middle Eastern client, I got out of tremendous obligations. I mean, The Plaza was actually a great deal for all of the wrong reasons but it turned out to be a phenomenal deal for me because, in other words, they wanted that deal to go through very quickly. I could've held them up for years. By allowing that deal to go through and for making it easy for the banks, I got out of tremendous other obligations. With the airline, you know, they gave me a tremendous amount of money to buy it. Now, the way I look at it is if the economy stayed good or went better, it would've been a good deal. But the economy didn't go good and I got out of the airline without any damage. I mean, it worked out fine. You have to understand, those were the go-go days where the banks would give you more money than you needed.
Mr. Trump, Hi. This is Jerry Markon. It's nice to talk to you again. I talked to you one time before. We're going to take you back briefly to the early O90s. It was life was kind of complicated during this period with Marla Maples.
I would say that is true. That is true. That, I agree.
You gave the Post a short interview during that period in which you were quoted as saying, as admitting that you had taken your eye off the ball a little bit on your businesses because of these personal troubles, and that your casino bondholders had some reason to be displeased with you because of that. Looking back, does that still seem true? How did your personal issues that were in the headlines every day, how did they affect your businesses at the time?
Yeah, I would say that's correct. I'm not going to take that back. The fact is I had the difficulty with the marriage, and, people, that does happen. What was going on? I had such tremendous success during the O80s. One of the magazines said in a story, everything he touches turns to gold, and frankly I believed that. Everything I was hitting was -. Trump Tower was a huge hit. I did the convention center site. I did the Grand Hyatt. I mean, they're all hits. I had all these hits, and all of a sudden, the market crashed. Now, I don't blame myself for the market crash but I've done very well. Like in the last market crash, I made a lot of market crash than you can in a good market. But I was -- I did take my eye off the ball and part of that was because of the difficulty I had with the marriage, of course.
Yeah, 65. Yeah, you're right.
It's 65, yeah. They gave me more money. In my opinion, it was the greatest deal I ever made because I saw the world collapsing, and instead of waiting a year, I took my pride and I said the hell with it and I called a meeting of the banks.
Not to be technical, but you said in your book that the greatest deal you ever made was with Merv Griffin when you trumped him, no pun intended, on the Taj.
Well, that was a good deal. That was a good deal. But this deal was more important. That was a good individual. I made a great -.
It does sound like getting in early gave you more negotiating position. A follow up question for you, just briefly -.
Honestly, without that, I may not be talking to you right now. In other words, clearly, that was a very big key, the fact that I was able to do -- I saw what was happening. I was able to do it early because, I'm telling you, six months you 10 cents, and they didn't even try. They destroyed people.
It's good stuff. We have a couple more questions. One, first of all, is the news that you mentioned about your recent financial disclosure. Is that public? If it's not, can we get a copy to jump on it? Can Rhona -.
Yeah. Sure. We did it. We filed it yesterday. We had a statement go with it, a press statement. I could have that sent to you. I think that they'll make it public. The numbers are extremely good. Don't forget, folks, the bad people -- I have boxes and it says 50 million or more. If I have a building that's worth 1.3 billion -.
It is, but we're not sure.
We filed it yesterday.
Yes.
Because frankly. I have done a great job.
Fairness and accuracy and balance is what we strive for.
I never get to be treated fairly, but I hope you -- if you treated me fairly, it would be a first.
Well, come on now. We already have treated you fairly. But that's our goal.
Frankly, a negative book isn't going to sell anyway, if you want to know the truth. I find the negative ones don't sell. Nowadays, it's the opposite. So anyway, why don't you check with federal elections. If you can get it, that's fine because they'd give it to you right over the Internet.
Yeah. Can you hear us?
Try getting it. If you can't -.
We have.
Oh. You can't get it?
Not yet. They're going to release it, of course. But it's just we were worried about the delays. If we can get a PDF or something from you right away, we would love that.
Well, I'll have to go and check that. Honestly, I have no objection. I just want to find, does federal election have a problem if you get a copy before it's approved.
No, I don't think so. But you check on that and I'll check back with Rhona?
Why don't you check with the FEC? If you can't get D-well, I will have the other end. If I'm allowed to do it, I'll give you a copy. OK?
Sure. That makes sense.
Here's an example. But if you start -- like I watch these bankers. They settle all these cases. They paid billions and billions of dollars.
But on the filing end, do you feel like there are lawsuits? I mean do you feel like --? You said you sometimes file lawsuits when you should not. I mean, what did you mean by that?
Well, I would say that, yeah, there had been some lawsuits that I filed where I could have done without them. And then frankly, overall, I'm better off doing -- to a certain extent, it's a business tool for me. I mean, I consider it a some lawsuits that probably would have been better off not filing, and there are some that maybe I wish I would have filed a lawsuit. But overall, I've done pretty well in litigation.
Mr. Trump, this is something we want to address in the -.
Yeah, go ahead.
The business tool aspect seems pretty clear from the track record. It feels like you are especially prone to threatening lawsuits against reporters or actually filing them in some cases. Why do you use lawsuits with gentle people like us so often? Why do you threaten reporters with lawsuits? And there's maybe 10 or 12 cases.
Well, let me explain. Because I get such dishonest publicity. For instance, there's a low life sleazebag named Timothy O'Brien who wrote a book where he said the net worth was $250 million. He knew it wasn't. He knew because we had a couple of people working with him. We had a woman who literally worked with him and he agreed that all of this stuff.-like the west side yard he said you only got a licensing fee, you don't get anything out of that. And they said, ONo, he owns 30 percent of it." ONo, no, he doesn't own it." Well, it turned out I do. In fact, now I own 30 percent of the Bank of America building and 30 percent of 1290 Avenue of the Americas. at the buyout. I said, no, I don't want that. I took buildings and they turned out to be very, very successful buildings, Bank of America definitely.
Why do you sue though? Is it to punish or just intimidate?
I sued in that case because it was so disgraceful. Now, libel suits are very hard and I may look at that frankly if I get elected because it's very unfair that somebody could write whatever they want to write and get away with it. And I will be bringing more libel suits as people -.maybe against you folks. I don't want to threaten, but I find that the press is unbelievably dishonest. In the case of O'Brien, I liked it because I cost him a lot of time and a lot of energy and a lot of money knowing that the case -- the judges said, well, you may be right, but -- it never really got litigated because they never let it go to court.
How much did that case cost? That must have costs both sides a lot. What do you think the total was?
It costs them a lot. It didn't cost me very much because I make good deals with my lawyers. But to me it was worth it because he was a very dishonest guy, and I have numerous people like that. Wayne Barrett, who covered me for my entire life, wrote a book that's so dishonest. I mean, if there the world of the mob. I understand the mob, and not my deal. If there were a mobster someplace in New York a day that I happened to be in New York, he would say I knew that mobster. Do you understand? He wrote -- it was so bad. I didn't read it, to be honest with you. I didn't read it. I didn't read the O'Brien book. I never read it. I saw some of the things they said. I said go sue him, it will cost him a lot of money.
By the way, you mentioned mobsters. One of the persons that's most interesting to us is a guy that was an FBI informant and a mob-related character named Danny Sullivan. You worked with him pretty closely, right?
So let me tell you about the FBI. I didn't know him well. He was a consultant for a little while, for a short while. He was a guy, a big storyteller. He was somebody that was -- I don't know if you know this, but he portrayed himself to be the closest person on earth to the FBI. Did you know that?
Yes.
And that half of the times that he would come in and what I have D-he was only a consultant. I didn't have him in the payroll.
I thought he was a real estate guy or something in Atlantic City.
No, no. He's not a real estate guy. He was a guy who actually was pretty effective at negotiating labor contracts.
Oh, wow. Because somebody was telling me, we're just talking trash a little bit, he was saying... that you guys used to go out in the evenings and stuff. Rhona Graff: Excuse me, gentlemen. I'm sorry to break in. But Trump is running way over -.
It's OK. Let me finish it up.
We definitely have to....
I did have a lot of respect for....
Sure, sure. And Mr. Trump, thank you again. Just really quickly, I'm just curious. Do you pay anything in income taxes?
I will give that to you as soon as I get my audit finished.
This is not a trick question. It's related to the -D do you remember way back in the O70s period, and this is the only information that we have, that we know of publicly where there were a couple of years where you didn't pay any taxes. And really, the question is over the years, this sweep of time, have you managed to pay taxes or have you gotten enough abatements and stuff?
Oh, I had paid taxes. Yes, I have. Now being in the real estate business, and you heard what I said to said this for a long time when people ask me. I say it politically. Somebody said the first politician I ever heard say this. Actually, a reporter came up to me. There was a press conference and somebody asked. I said I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible. One of the reasons is because the government takes your money and wastes it in the Middle East and all over the place. They have no idea what they're doing. And I fight very hard to pay as little tax as possible. Now, with that being said, I have paid taxes. With that being said, it's substantial. But with that being said, when you're in the real estate business, you do have certain tax advantages that -.
Mr. Trump, this is Jerry Markon. I'm going to ask one last question. I know you have to go.
Sure.
Going back to the early O90s, you mentioned before that you did, due to the circumstances in the economy, need some more money which the banks provided you. I wanted to ask if you remember about a specific bank drawdown that we've been told was significant at the time. We were told that one of the reasons the bank group wanted to meet with you when you called them, was concerned about your finances, is that you would have D I don't know if you remember this D a specific line was told to me by numerous sources is that you suddenly drew down all, or the majority, or at least a very substantial chunk of that 100 million at once, in like one day in the spring of 1990, which was considered pretty unusual at the time, and the bankers were sort of alarmed. They looked at that and said, wow, Mr. Trump has a problem; we have a problem.
It's even better than that. It's even better than that. The world was going to hell. The economy was starting to crash. The bankers were on vacation that handled that particular debt, and I said draw it down. And frankly, had I not -- I had a $100 million line of credit and I drew down the money, whatever the money was. I drew down the money. I took everything out of the bank. And when the guys came back from vacation a week later they say, wow, Trump. That drawdown was a great drawdown for me because I was able to take the money out of the bank -.
Was it the entire 100 million at once?
I took it down to zero, yeah. I think I had a little bit less than a 100. You know, there was a little draw
Do you think like 90, 95?
It was in that area. Essentially, I took down $100 million with one draw immediately. That money plus guys -- so when other guys were going bankrupt all over the place, and then about a year after that, as you know, no bank was loaning money. They couldn't. They didn't have any money. They weren't illiquid. They're going out of business. That was the savings and loans problems and all of that, no bank had any money. You couldn't borrow 10 cents.
Two things about that. One, the bankers were literally on vacation that week?
They were on vacation. They were on vacation. It's sort of an amazing story.
It is.
Funny that you found that out. But yeah, I withdrew -- I said because it's called immediate drawdown. I withdrew the entire amount in the fund which, by the way, gets wired right into your account. I went through the entire amount of the fund.
Do you remember exactly when this was? I know this was a long time ago, but we think it was maybe April 1990 or something like that.
It was probably in 1990 when the market was starting to collapse. It was a very important element in my success because nobody else had that and they all died and they willing to go early and talk to these banks early, this was before the banks even knew they were in trouble but I could see what was happening. I had a great vision for that. I saw what was happening. So the fact that I was able to get the banks to make a deal then -- I 'm telling you if I would have gone five months later, as the expression goes, I might not be talking to you right now.
So the fact that it was the 65 that you got from the banks plus whether it was 90, 95 or all 100 that you got from this drawdown, just to be clear, that's what you used to make the payments that were coming due that summer on the Castle, on some of your other assets which you otherwise would not have had the money for those payments?
Yeah, I made payments. I bought my way out of it. Because what happened was a year later -D so I had cash. A year later, when the banks went bad D actually less than that D I was able to buy back debt at tremendous discounts. I was able to get out of personal guarantees, including the one you're talking about. But really the Plaza got me out of that more than anything else. But I was able to get out of personal guarantees. I bought debt back at tremendous discounts because the banks were desperate to get money. They had no money. got really bad in the economy. By the way, that was as close to 1928, the Depression, as there has ever been in this country. When you look at the one that happened nine years ago or whatever it might be, that was peanuts compared to 1990.
Mr. Trump, this is absolutely fascinating. Why did you wait until the bankers went on vacation? Did you ever sense that they would not have OK'd the drawdown, that they would have opposed it?
No. I heard they were on vacation. I didn't know and, frankly, I didn't care. They were obligated to give me the money. Now maybe they wouldn't have because saw the world was going bad, but they were obligated. But the fact that they weren't there made it very easy. In fact, when the banks said what is this, one of them went back and went absolutely berserk. They couldn't believe it. They couldn't believe that we drew it down. They couldn't believe that Bankers allowed the whole amount to go out in one shot.
Thank you so much.
Thank you all. Thank you all. I hope you treat me fairly and I appreciate it. All right?
As for Republicans who say they won't support or endorse him...
I don't even want -- if -- if somebody doesn't want to endorse, I don't want their endorsement. It's OK. I'm going to release them.
It doesn't have to be unified.
No, I don't think so. I think it would be better if it were unified. I think it would be, uh, there would be something good about it. But I don't think it actually has to be unified in the traditionally sense.
So, not -- fair game.
I think fair game, yeah. No, I think fair game.
As Trump make clear Friday night.
Nobody in this country, and maybe in the history of the country politically, was worse than Bill Clinton with women. He was a disaster.
And Saturday.
Hillary Clinton's husband abused women more than any man that we know of in the history of politics, right. She's married to a man who was the worst abuser of women in the history of politics. She's married to a man who hurt many women. And Hillary, if you look and you study, Hillary hurt many women.
You say fixing the economy is your number one priority as president. And your tax plan is your more substantive and specific proposal out there. You said recently again that you believe in raising taxes on the wealthy, including yourself, but your plan gives a massive tax cut to the wealthy. How do you square that?
It gives a massive tax cut to everybody. If you look at Larry Kudlow, he said it's a great plan. He loves the plan.
But bottom line, do you want taxes on the wealthy to go up or down?
They will go up a little bit. And they may got up, you know...
-- dichotomy.
I don't mind paying more tax, I'll be honest with you. I don't mind paying more tax. I've done very well over the last 40 years.
No, on the taxes on the wealthy.
Everybody -- please...
Let's talk about that, because...
-- George, I've gone all over this country over the last three -- really, more the eight weeks than ever before.
And you said you want those to come back...
-- Pennsylvania.
-- Carrier, Ford...
I want them to come back.
But if you want other companies to make their products in America, shouldn't you make your products in America?
But they don't make a lot of these products. They don't even make them here anymore. If you look at...
But shouldn't you lead by example?
George, I told you, they don't even make this stuff here. When I want to buy...
But don't you push those allies away with your plan that...
No, you don't push anybody...
Let me put you back in the Oval Office...
-- and we -- we can't...
-- though...
-- we don't know who these people are. We don't know where they're coming from.
You're in the Oval Office...
I will stop that immediately.
You know, you complained about the system a lot. I'm curious, are you now more open to same-day voter registration, allowing independents to vote in any primary they want? Are you going to be somebody that's going to advocate for those positions now, to make it easier to vote, since your voters had a hard time?
Well, you can't expand the party that way. And you know, we've done it both ways. I've always done better when independents could cross over, and frankly when Democrats could cross over. You know, in New York when we were doing the voting, they interviewed -- a lot of people interviewed the people at the voting booths, that you know, manned the voting booths. And they were saying that they've never seen anything like it --
Well, they banned same day -- you realize that in New York, had there been same day voter registration those people could have voted. So are you for that?
Well, I'll tell you what. But they said that they've never seen so many Democrats wanting to vote for Trump. They were by the thousands. And I will say this. On Election Day, we're going to do very well in New York. But the people were saying to the press that they'd never seen anything like it. They've been there for 30 and 40 years doing this kind of stuff.
But you're not -- but I'm just curious --
-- where Democrats are going over.
-- do you want to see the voting laws changed to make it easier to vote?
I want to see voting laws so that people that are citizens can vote. Not so people that can walk off the street and can vote, or so that illegal immigrants can vote --
So you're not for same-day voter registration?
No, no. I want to make the voting laws so that people that -- it doesn't make any difference how they do it. But I don't think people should sneak in through the cracks. You have to have -- And whether that's an ID or any way you want to do it. But you have to be a citizen to vote.
Well, of course. That is the law as it stands already. Let me ask --
No, it's not. I mean, you have places where people just walk in and vote.
And so your case to Paul Ryan is, "Hey, the voters have decided. Get on board."
Well, I would say that's true. I mean, to be honest. I like Paul Ryan. I think he's a very good guy. He called me three weeks ago, and he was so supportive. It was amazing. And I never thought a thing like this. I got blindsided by this --
If he can't endorse you, do you think he should be chair of the Convention?
I don't want to mention now. I'll see after. I will give you a very solid answer, if that happens, about one minute after that happens. OK? But there's no reason to give it right now. But I'll be very quick with the answer. Let's see what happens --
Well, it sounds like I know what the answer is, but you don't want to say it yet. You don't want to sound -- you're not here -- you don't want to issue threats.
No, inappropriate. We'll see.
You know --
-- and by the way, Chuck. Very important. He signed a pledge. He pledged that he would support the nominee. And so did this lightweight, Lindsey Graham. He pledged that he would support the nominee. They ran. They lost --
You threatened to back away from that pledge a lot, for various reasons --
No, no, no. I didn't back away. In fact, one of the reasons I didn't back away is that I happen to be, despite what a few people think, I happen to be a very honorable guy. I signed a pledge. And that's a binding pledge. You know, I heard, "It's not binding." Well, it is a binding pledge. I have the best lawyers in the world. They say it's an absolutely binding pledge. And I intended it to be binding.
Well, it was very binding for South Carolina. That was the only way to get on the ballot.
Well, remember -- Chuck, Chuck, remember this. Jeb Bush signed a pledge. A binding pledge. Lindsey Graham signed a binding pledge that they would endorse. That they would support and endorse. That's what it says. Now they're breaking. You know, that's a question of honor. They are not honorable people when they do that. Because they're going against the pledge --
Let me --
Wait a minute.
OK.
So if Mitt Romney did that, I would be happy to talk to him. I think it's great. And I would be because I respect him
You want him to thank you first, for 2012, before you will reach out to him --
I helped -- I helped Mitt Romney a lot.
And you feel like he was ungrateful --
I did. I believe I won him, or helped him win, five states that he was going to lose in the primaries, OK --
Sounds like you think he was ungrateful. You think he's been ungrateful?
He was. He was ungrateful. Which is OK. A lot of people are ungrateful. But he was ungrateful. He did not -- They did not respond accordingly. And that's OK.
Alright.
But let's see what happens. Let's see what happens --
So is that --
Now, when it comes time to negotiate, I feel less concerned with the rich than I do with the middle class.
So it sounds like -- should we take that --
And I feel very concerned at that.
-- should we assume that most of your plans, then, we shouldn't take you at your word, as sort of that they're floors? What you just described? That, "You know what, it's my opening statement, but everything is negotiable -- "
It's not a word. Excuse me. Excuse me. It's called life, Chuck. It's not my word, of course. I put in a proposal. You know what they are? They're really proposals. People can say it's a tax plan. It's really a tax proposal. Because after I put it in, and I think you know the Senate and Congress --
Wait a minute. Let me stop you there. You just said, "Businesses might pay a little bit more." You just said, "Business might pay a little bit more, but we're going to get 'em a massive tax cut." You just said it within ten words.
No, no. I didn't say it. Excuse me. I said they might have to pay a little bit more than my proposal, Chuck. I said they might have --
Oh, your proposal. OK. I just wanted to get that clear.
-- yeah, than my proposal.
Fair enough.
I'm not talking about more than they're paying now.
Got you.
We're the highest taxed nation in the world. Our businesses pay more taxes than any businesses in the world. That's why companies are leaving. So they may have to pay a little bit more than my proposal, is what I mean. I assume you knew that. I assume you know that.
Got you. OK. No, no, no, no. I just wanted to clear that up.
OK, good. Good, I'm glad you cleared it up --
Right. You want the fed -- but should the federal government set a floor, and then you let the states --
No, I'd rather have the states go out and do what they have to do. And the states compete with each other, not only other countries, but they compete with each other, Chuck. So I like the idea of let the states decide. But I think people should get more. I think they're out there. They're working. It is a very low number. You know, with what's happened to the economy, with what's happened to the cost. I mean, it's just -- I don't know how you live on $7.25 an hour. But I would say let the states decide.
Another contradiction has been on your feelings toward Hillary Clinton. In 2012, as she was leaving Secretary of State, you praised her. You thought she did a good job. You even sort of said, "You know what, she's not pushing her agenda. She had to carry on somebody else's agenda." Before that, you didn't fault her on the Iraq War vote because you said, "You know what, she got bad intelligence like a lot of other people got." Now, you're saying --
I didn't get bad intelligence. I didn't get bad intelligence.
-- you say all -- I understand that. But you kind of forgave her on that early on. Now, you call her, "She's been crooked from the start." I guess this goes back to which Donald Trump do we believe on your feelings toward Hillary Clinton --
So let me explain it.
All right, last question. Why not release the tax returns that aren't involved in the audit?
Because it's a link. I have very big tax returns. I'm sure you've seen the picture where the returns are literally from the floor to up to here. They're extremely complex. I get audited --
Do you think you can do it before the election, though?
I hope so. I'd like to. I have no problem releasing the tax returns --
Do you pledge to do it before the election?
Excuse me. Sure. If the auditors finish. I'll do it as fast as the auditors finish. Remember this, I've already given my financials. And my financials show I'm worth more than $10 billion by any stretch of the imagination. Has tremendous cash. Tremendous cash flow. You don't learn much from tax returns. But I would love to give the tax returns. But I can't do it until I'm finished with the audit.
Donald Trump, I've got to leave it there. The crowd, it's fired up. We already heard Mike Leach, Steve Emtman.
It's fired up.
Big Washington State stars up there. Thank you for coming on, sir.
That's right. They're great people. Thank you.
We need to talk policy. We need to talk the state of play within your own party, but you have commanded a different headline that needs to be addressed. You are attacking Hillary Clinton for the sexual past and indiscretions of her husband, calling her an enabler. We have a panel of independent voters. They are smart as heck and most of them don't like it. They see it as a distraction, they see it as hypocritical coming from you, and mostly they see it as potential proof you may have no real ideas to offer as president. What is your thinking on this line of attack?
Well, this is a nice way to start off the interview. First of all, you should congratulate me for having won the race. I thought at least there would be a small congratulations, but I'm not surprised with CNN because that's the way they treat Trump. It's the -- they call it the Clinton Network and I believe that. So, you know...
Wait, hold on. Mr. Trump, I did congratulate you the last time we spoke. I said congratulations on winning the big race. What are you going to do going forward?
Thank you very much. So warm and so well-felt.
But you -- no, no, no, hold on, hold on. Let's get this off on the right foot. I'm trying to address what you...
You're starting off with a question, we haven't spoken, last week, towards the end, I was the, essentially the nominee of the party, and you start off with this question which is not surprising, because I understand CNN perhaps a lot better than you do.
OK, OK, you know what? You're right. Sometimes it's good to restart. Here's the restart. You are going to be your party's nominee by all accounts. You are going to carry the standard for this party. You have said that once you get into the general, people will see what you have to offer. The first thing that you've come out with hot and heavy out of the box are these attacks on Hillary Clinton.
That wasn't the first thing I came out with. The first thing I came out with, if you watched, was trade. We're making horrible trade deals, we're losing our jobs, we're losing our manufacturing, it's trade. The next thing I came out with is rebuilding our military, because our military is absolutely being decimated. We're not spending the proper money. We're not buying the proper equipment. We're not taking care of our soldiers. We're not taking care of our vets, by the way. But we're not taking care of our military at a time when we just about in the history of our country need it the most. So I talk about that. I talk about the border. I talk about the fact that we have to stop the drugs from pouring into our country. Those are the things I talk about in a very long speech in Washington, actually Nebraska, which was unbelievable -- every one of them had tens of thousands of people. I mean, they were massively attended, which, of course you don't mention, nor does CNN ever show the crowds. It's very interesting, because CNN -- I could be making a speech for an hour, they'll never show the extent of the crowd.
Well I'll tell you, Mr. Trump, I would suggest that CNN shows your events more than they show any other candidate's.
... where we had a record crowd, where Hillary Clinton said she wants to put the coal miners out of business, the miners.
We covered that extensively.
She said she wants the miners and the companies to go out of business.
We covered it extensively. On the military, you raise an important issue. We tried to get your campaign and the other campaigns to hold forth on whether or not they supported the current G.I. bill. As you know, in the congress, they did this sneaky vote in the house where there was no roll call and they were going to cut money from the G.I. bill to allow for other expenditures for vets. The vets were very upset. They said, no, don't take money from us and reallocate it. Find the savings elsewhere. Do you support maintaining the G.I. bill the way it is right now and even growing it as opposed to cutting it?
I don't want to be hurting our vets. Our vets have been hurt enough. We treat illegal immigrants better than we treat our vets. So I'm going to do nothing to hurt our vets. I'm going to only help our vets.
So is that a yes?
I'm not Hillary Clinton that thinks that the vets are getting too much. And they're not getting too much. I've traveled, I've seen so many vets, I know so many vets now and I have a lot of friends. I've developed great friendships among the vets. Our vets are being treated very badly.
So is that a yes, I do support the current G.I. bill?
No. I want to bring jobs back to our country, I want to make our country go again. I just traveled. I won so many states in a row in massive landslides and part of the reason was trade. It wasn't what you brought up at the beginning of the show which was totally inappropriate. Part of the reason I won was because of trade and I talk trade and I'm the only one that can do anything about trade. I'm going to renegotiate these trade deals. These trade deals have sucked everything out of our country. And by the way, Clinton is the one that approved NAFTA. NAFTA is the worst deal, one of the worst deals our country's ever made from an economic standpoint. One of the worst deals ever. It's taken -- if you've seen what it's done to New York State and New England and virtually every state, but it's just -- it is just, it has sucked the jobs out of our country, it sucked the money out of our country. We're going to bring our jobs back. We're going to make it much harder for people to leave, for people to take their companies and just go to Mexico and then sell the product back into the United States with no tax or nothing.
All right, so let's unpack a little of this stuff one at a time. And first of all, just to get back to tone, just for one second, a little bit of this is because you're on the phone. As you know, when you're in person with somebody, very often you can interpret questions...
You would have asked the same question in person.
You can criticize it all you want. I'm just saying you want to keep the history. Bush was involved with NAFTA.
Excuse me. Who signed NAFTA? Whose bill was it and who signed it?
But what is your point, though? This was in the Bush administration.
But this was one of the worst deals ever made in the history of our country...
Bush 41.
... and it has just destroyed manufacturing, and destroyed jobs.
All right, that's a valid point. You just have to spread the blame across both parties and you have to come up with a solution.
No, but the signer of NAFTA, take a look at who signed it. Check it out.
Bush 41.
OK. You take a look. You take a look. NAFTA was a Clinton deal and he wanted it so badly, and I have not been a big fan of what went on in terms, economic developmentally, or with the war with Bush either, frankly, if you want to know the truth. I mean, there's a whole -- that's a whole other story. But if you look at NAFTA and you take a look at what's been done and how hard Clinton pushed it and that bill has been an absolute disaster. The passage of that has been an absolute disaster for our country.
All right. Fair point. You want to criticize NAFTA. Doing more about trade, helping veterans.
And we're going to bring it back and we're going to bring the jobs back into our country and we're going to make it very hard for companies to leave and then sell product back into our country and rip us off, and all we end up getting is unemployment of great people.
All real issues. As you know, the last time we spoke, when we did talk about your taking everybody out in the race and now being the man yourself, we talked about how you would bring about bringing back jobs. You said, I would tax companies who don't do the right thing. I would have a tariff imposed. I said, that's what congress does, not a president. You said, well I'll work with them. All real issues. And that's why I was so surprised to see you going after Clinton for her husband's infidelity and calling her an enabler.
It's only retribution for what she said. She is playing the woman's card to the hilt. She is going -- I mean I watched over the weekend, everything is about woman and Donald Trump raised his voice. It's all nonsense. And you know what, women understand it better than anybody, and watch how well I do with women when it counts, when the election comes. Watch how well, because women want to see strong security, they want to see strong military, they want to see borders where people can't just come walking across the border like it's Swiss cheese, and you see the damage that's been done to our country with the weak borders. You see what's happening. You see the crime. You see the drugs flowing in and poisoning our youth and everybody else.
But then why don't you talk about those issues and get women on your side as opposed to talking about infidelity and enabling?
I do. You took one sentence out of a long one hour speech. You took one sentence...
Mr. Trump, it's not one sentence. You were grandstanding on it, you were working the crowd about it...
Chris, I spoke very little about that compared to other things. You took a small amount of the speech and you build it up like it's the biggest thing in the world, but it is a big thing. Hey look, he was the worst abuser of women...
You just said I'm making too much of it, now you say it's a big thing.
Excuse me. As a politician in the history of our country. He was impeached! He was impeached! And then he lied about it. He said, nothing happened with Monica Lewinsky, and then he said, sorry folks, it actually did happen. And the guy was impeached for lying.
All of that can be true. What does it have to do with Hillary?
She can't talk about me because nobody respects women more than Donald Trump, and I will be better for women by a big factor than Hillary Clinton, who frankly, I don't even think will be good to women. You know, she went and she spoke -- it was very interesting. She spoke a few weeks ago and she said, I'm going to put the miners and the companies out of business. Then she went to West Virginia and she tried to pretend she didn't make the statement, and that's the way it is with here. The lies and the deception, it's horrible. And by the way, they understand her in West Virginia, and I'll bet you that she loses West Virginia, which she was easily supposed to win, and I would bet that if you took a poll there now, myself compared to her, you'll see a big difference. But you watch the problems she'll have. But the deception and the lies, and she tried to pretend like she didn't mean it.
All right, let's talk about something else. Sarah Palin came out and said, Paul Ryan is done. I'm calling on the supporters of Donald Trump to go after Paul Ryan and make sure that he gets Cantered, as in Eric Canter, that he loses his seat where he is. Do you want that? Do you want Sarah Palin going out there and trying to turn people against Paul Ryan? You're supposed to be unifying the party.
Well, Sarah has endorsed me and I like her a lot. I think she's a terrific person.
But do you want that? Do you want Paul Ryan kicked out?
Let me finish what I wanted to say, OK? But I have nothing to do with that. Sarah is very much a free agent. She's a terrific person but she's very much a free agent and I didn't know about this until yesterday. I guess she's been fighting, or she's endorsing somebody that's running against Paul Ryan and I didn't know about it until yesterday when I read about it.
But this is a big deal. Paul Ryan, the speaker there, you have said to this point, to give you your due, hey, I want Ryan on my side. I want to work with him.
I'll go a step further. I've always liked him. He called me not so long ago, I don't know, a number of weeks ago, but he called me and he was very supportive and very nice and I thought everything was fine, and then I got blindsided, so we'll see. I mean look, I'll see what happens. Look, Chris, I think you know this better than anybody -- the Republican Party, because of me, has received more votes than any time in its history during these primaries, right? Is that a correct statement?
You are on track to...
No, no, is that a correct statement?
... more votes than anybody in this primary.
No, no, I'm not even talking about me. Because of me, there has been a massive turnout...
Any GOP primary ever, you've gotten the most votes.
Because of me, you got the highest rates in the history of CNN during a debate and Fox set the all time record for cable television, 24 million and 23 million, OK. Now, most importantly, from my standpoint, in the history of primaries, I -- with many states left. It'll be beaten this weekend. I think it might already be beat -- I've received more votes than any person ever to run in the Republican primary. So I have people that I'm representing. They're unbelievable people. They're loyal, they're smart, they're sharp, they're tired of being abused, they're tired of being lied to by people like Hillary Clinton with the 3:00 in the morning and then she never answered the call, Benghazi, all of the things, all of the emails, it's just a mess with her, so they're tired of it. They're tired of not having increases in their wages for a period of 18 years. Essentially they're making less money now in real wages than they made 18 years ago and we have a group of people that's great. This group of people has given me, and it's them, it's a group. I'm like a messenger, but they've given me a number that no other president, not Ronald Reagan, nobody, has ever gotten. And by the way, we have many states left. We have California, we have New Jersey, Washington State where I was this weekend, I was at Oregon, I was in Nebraska, I was in West Virginia -- they haven't even been included in these numbers yet, so we're going to break it by millions and millions of votes. So I represent a very important group of people and a powerful group of people. These people have to be treated with respect, Chris.
Understood. But Paul Ryan said, I'm not ready to endorse yet. You know you have the big meeting coming. This weekend, you gave him some cause for concern. It seemed as though you were saying this weekend two things that were different from what you said in the past. One on taxes for the wealthy where you said you were open to taxing them more. As you know, that's against the conservative...
I didn't say that, Chris.
Well that's how it's being reported. Tell us.
NBC misrepresented and Chuck Todd, if they put out that clip, in fact, I corrected him when he said it. Let's get it straight so maybe there's somebody listening to your show so we can actually have...
There are millions watching.
Let me just set it straight. I put in the biggest tax decrease of anybody running for office by far, OK, and many people think it's great, and if anything, I was criticized because it's too steep a cut, but that's OK, but I put in by far the biggest tax decrease. All right. What I said -- and that really is a proposal because we have to go to congress, we have to go to the senate, we have to go to our congress men and women and we have to negotiate a deal. So it really is a proposal, but it's a very steep proposal. I said that I may have to increase the section -- and by the way, everybody across the board, businesses, everybody's getting a tax cut, especially the middle class. And I said that I may have to increase it on the wealthy. I'm not going to allow it to be increased on the middle class. Now, if I increase on the wealthy, that means they're still going to be paying less than they pay now. I'm not talking about increasing from this point, I'm talking about increasing from my tax proposal.
Key distinction.
And Chuck Todd understood that totally, and yet they released information like I'm looking to increase the taxes. They will be getting a reduction, but the big reduction is going to be for business and for the middle class, because the middle class is being decimated in our country. So it was totally misrepresented just now by you and it was misrepresented frankly by NBC.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, Mr....
... and actually, Chuck Todd, when I corrected him on the show and he put it on, and yet they go then and talk about like I'm giving a tax increase for the wealthy, I'm not. I said, they may have to pay somewhat more than my proposal. But my proposal is much less than people are paying right now.
I totally understand, but when something is reported a certain way and I ask you about it and give you the opportunity to correct it, that's not me misrepresenting, that's giving you the opportunity you want which is to tell the audience what the truth is.
Well OK, and there was one other thing that was really misrepresented, I'll tell you this...
About the minimum wage?
... and that's the buyback of debt. I said, if we can buy back government debt at a discount, in other words, if interest rates go up and we can buy bonds back at a discount, if we are liquid enough as a country, we should do that. In other words, we can buy back debt at a discount. People said, I want to go and buy debt and default on debt and -- these people are crazy. This is the United States Government. First of all, you never have to default because you print the money, I hate to tell you, OK, so there's never a default, but the point is, it was reported in The New York Times in correctly...
That you said you would go to creditors and make them take less.
It was reported in the failing New York Times and other places that I want to default on debt -- I'm the king of debt. I understand debt better than probably anybody. I know how to deal with debt very well. I love debt. But debt is tricky and it's dangerous and you have to be careful and you have to know what you're doing, but let me just tell you, if there's a chance to buy back debt at a discount, U.S. debt, in other words, interest rates go up and the bonds go down, you can buy debt, that's what I'm talking about. People had it, The Times and others wrote, oh, Trump wants to go and see creditors and buy debt at a discount. Now there could even be a time when somebody comes in but with the government, they're never going to walk in and say, do me a favor. Would you buy my debt at a discount? In business, that happens all the time. I bought mortgages back when the market went bad. I bought mortgages back at tremendous discounts, and I love doing that. There's nothing like it, actually. It gives me a great thrill. But in the United States with bonds, that won't happen because in theory, the market doesn't go down so that you default on debt and that's what happens. So here's the story. Just to have it corrected -- if we have an opportunity where interest rates go up and you can buy debt back at a discount, I always like to be able to do that if you can do it, but that's all I was talking about. They have it like I'm going to go back to creditors and I'm going to...
Yes. That's what they were reporting.
... restructure debt, it's ridiculous. They know it's ridiculous, but they printed that wrong purposely.
All right. So let's just be clear. Your team is saying you've got to go, I know you have a lot of different interviews to do. It's good of you to accept these opportunities because it's important for the people to hear these distinctions in what's reported versus what you say is on the table from you, and that's the opportunity...
Well, there's so much misreporting. I mean, the press...
Well look, and that's why we ask you to come on.
The press is unbelievably dishonest. There's so much -- and they know it's wrong. Like, you have a lightweight, a real dope...
Mr. Trump, they say you have to...
... named Jennifer Rubin who spoke about, I didn't speak to Rubio. Well I have spoken to Rubio. And then she said I never spoke to Ryan. Well I have spoken to Ryan, and she's living in a time warp or something, you watch her...
Don't worry -- look, there are going to be a lot of talking heads say a lot of different things. What I offer you is this.
Someday you'll put good people on about Trump, one of these days.
Look, what I want is to have you on. That's why I offer you these opportunities...
OK, well I'm on.
... not to be unfair, to be fair and to give you the chance to correct what you say others get wrong and to be tested. Thank you for being here today, your team is saying you've got to get going, but I appreciate the time on "New Day." I want to talk to you, not about you. Thank you for being with us.
Good. Thank you.
Take care.
Thank you very much.
Well, you've also got Senator Jeff Sessions, he has been a fantastic supporter. Yeah.
Oh, Jeff Sessions is great. And Darrell -- Darrell Issa just came out, you know. And we have tremendous -- we have...
Exactly. And we just spoke to Scott Brown, too. He's a big supporter of yours.
You have Scott Brown, you have Dick Cheney, just came out.
Yeah.
No, I have tremendous support.
No, I know that. Absolutely.
I'll tell you what, nobody -- nobody -- hey, Maria, nobody ever mentions that. They'll mention like, two people that are against. So, you know, it's one of those.
Look, bottom line is you are running, congratulations, Donald Trump.
Thank you.
It's a 15 percent business rate.
Well, I lowered the tax -- I lowered the business with the highest taxed nation in the world, and I have it that we're among the lower tax nations. Not the lowest, but how low can you go, right?
Thank you so much, Donald.
But -- but Maria, as long as I've been on your show, there's another thing that was said. Bonds. Now, nobody knows more about debt. I'm like the king. I love debt. I...
You call yourself the king of debt, and people are like, that's not a good thing, Donald Trump.
No, it's a good thing.
Right.
All I said is that, if interest rates go up, we will have a chance to buy back bonds at a discount, which is standard.
OK.
But certainly I'm not talking about renegotiating with creditors.
What about the minimum wage, Donald? You said you -- you can't imagine how anyone could live on $7.25.
OK. ON the minimum wage, I would like to leave it to the states.
Right.
But I would leave the minimum wage to the states.
So, do you see that as sort of the template? Should most states go to $15? I mean, you've got it in New York, and you've also got it in California.
No, but states are different. I mean, in New York it's very expensive to live.
OK.
But in other states, it's not expensive at all, I mean, by comparison to New York. New York would...
Yeah, you're absolutely right. You make a great point.
OK.
Everybody has a different mentality, a different cost of living. That's absolutely right.
Much different. I mean...
Donald, what about your vice presidential pick? Yeah.
By the way, Maria, I have people that work for me in different locations and throughout the country, and I pay them for the same job, much less -- and they have a better lifestyle than they have in New York.
Yeah, makes a lot of sense.
All right.
Real quick now, before you go, your vice presidential pick, I know you're going to announce it at the convention. Characteristics you are looking for? You said military mojo or foreign-policy mojo. And you said Washington experience.
Well, I like -- I do like military mojo, because our military is being decimated.
Right.
So, I got a little bit of a pleasant surprise. But we have some great vice presidential people that will be -- I think they'll be fantastic.
We will see you soon.
OK.
We will be looking forward to that meeting on Thursday. Donald Trump joining us this morning.
Thanks.
Ok, but he knows all that. So you are not going to go in and tell him stuff he knows. What are you going to tell him about unifying the party?
No but -- I might repeat it nevertheless because it's an important thing.
All right.
And I would like to see unity in the party. I believe we'll have great unity in the party. Many people have come out and endorsed and been really strong. Rick Perry came out today and many others. And they really gave their support in a very strong fashion.
Ok. But not Ryan. Ryan is holding back.
I think we're going to have great -- he is a very good man. He wants what's good for the party. And I think we're going to have very positive results. And I look frankly for him to stay and be chairman.
So you think, you know, and I know you have to say this, that he is going to fall in line and endorse you and he will be at the convention and everything will be fine.
I don't think he will fall into line. I don't think fall in to line is the right words, Bill. I think he loves this party, he loves this country, and he wants to see something good happen. I think we're going to do better if we are unified. I think that he will --
Yes.
In other words, myself loans the money because that's the way --
Yes.
-- the loan was stated --
But you're going to get paid back.
-- but I really -- no, I don't expect to be paid back.
But you will be, sure. That's the loan. When the funds come in to help your presidential race, that money will flow back to you. I mean, you don't have to take it. But --
-- I don't have to take it.
-- you are entitled to it.
I don't have to take it. But I think the number is $45 million. And I think that's far less --
Right. But you need a billion.
-- than anybody else.
You're going to have to have that party raise money for you. You are going to have to.
Yes -- I'm raising money -- but I'm raising money really for the party. I'm going to also continue to spend my own money on myself. But I'm raising money for the party and I think we will raise a lot. I have no idea what the number is going to be. Maybe it's going to be a billion. We'll raise whatever we need -- Bill.
Can you give me one?
I would love to give you all five but I can't, Bill.
You are in charge.
It's not even fair to you.
Of course it's fair to me. It's fair to my viewers. It's fair to me. You are in charge. You can do it. You just don't want to do it?
Well, I just think it would be inappropriate. You know, the way I always envision it is during the convention.
All right. So, I'm out. You said experience politicians, I'm out.
But you would be good.
I'm gone.
I would offer it to you immediately.
No, I would take a word is really well.
I know, that's the problem.
That's the problem. All right. Let me get to Elizabeth Warren. She doesn't like you but out of nowhere on Friday she is calling you names and stuff like that. What do you think that's about?
Well, she is a senator that has done nothing. She just talks. And she is -- you know, she has put in things, she has gotten nothing approved. She has not highly respected. Frankly, as you know, the previous supporter of mine Scott Brown is somebody that gave me a lot of information about her and friends up there, she has had a big failed record as a senator. And all of a sudden about a week ago, she started tweeting violently about me. Just every tweet was like about Trump, Trump, Trump. And I finally hit her back and I think I hit her back very hard.
But why is she doing that?
I had no choice but to do that.
Why do you think she taking the time to tweet bad things about you?
Because she sees polls that I'm going to beat Hillary. And she would like to make sure the Democrats win. But she sees polls that I'm going to beat Hillary, and a lot of, you know, there are a lot of polls taken by individual people that show me beating Hillary fairly easily, and she doesn't want that to happen. Now, she has -- I have never seen -- she went on a Twitter rant that was sort of amazing. So, I tweeted a few things and that was the end of that and I haven't heard from her since.
I have a question from a viewer. Diane Ranke from Silver Spring, Maryland. Donald Trump says he is pro-life. Please ask him to name one specific thing he would do to protect the sanctity of human life. Can you?
Well, I think that are what we're doing and I think it's a very important element in what I have done. I have become pro-life. I was in a meek fashion pro-choice, but I have become pro-life. But I become pro- life. And the reason is, I have seen, in my case one specific situation, but numerous situations that have made me to go that way. I will protect it and the biggest way you can protect it is through the Supreme Court and putting people in the court. And actually the biggest way you can protect it, I guess, is by electing me president.
All right. So, you are going to get a judge who would overthrow -- overturn Roe v. Wade? That's a specific thing --
Well, overturn or -- look, I'm going to put conservative judges on. I think one of the biggest things happening in terms of this election are, you know, it could be as many as five judges will be appointed over the next four and a half years. So we're talking about five judges. And I think probably the most important thing that one of the most important thing, other than the security itself of the country is going to be the appointment of four to five Supreme Court justices and I will be doing that.
All right. So, let me just get this straight. So that Diane's question is answered. Your specific thing to protect the sanctity of life would be appointing a Supreme Court justice that would overturn Roe v. Wade. Do I have it?
Well, they will be pro-life and we will see what about overturning. But we will appoint -- I will appoint judges that will be pro-life, yes.
OK. Finally, I was a little upset because my taxes are going to go up if you win. I'm going to be paying more now.
That is wrong. No, no, it was incorrectly. If you read the "Wall Street Journal" front-page today, they covered it exactly correct. I am going -- I have the biggest tax cut of anybody running by far and that includes the 16 people that are vanquished. OK? And nobody even came close. But, I may have to raise it from that point.
So your original statement in the debates you might have to go up a little for me. For me, I may have to pay more?
No, no, what it meant -- Bill, you are going to actually perhaps go down, actually. Everybody is going to go down. But who is really going to go down is the middle class --
OK.
-- who have been absolutely destroyed by taxes and also businesses.
You yourself wouldn't mind paying more.
No I wouldn't mind paying more.
But that's kind of an indication -- that's kind of an indication that guys in your bracket.
No.
No?
No. The question was asked, would I mine paying more? I wouldn't mind. But the fact is that everybody is going to be paying less and we will going to run a much better -- we are going to run -- hey, Bill, we are going to run a country that works. We will going to get this country going again. Because right now this country is stalled so badly and taxes are going to go down. And that's one of the ways we're going to get it to work.
Well, it's shaping up to be a very interesting race. I hope you will come on and tell me what happened with the Paul Ryan meeting which I think is going to be fascinating.
I think so too. I look forward to it.
Yes. Just tell me what happened. I can report it. Or you can come on on Friday whenever you want. But we would really like to know what happens there. Donald, as always.
We'll do it. We'll do it.
Thanks for taking the time. We really appreciate it?
Thank you very much, Bill.
I did.
Oh good. Did you see Sarah Malone?
You know what, I did not see her but we had a long phone conversation after I got back. We talked for about an hour on the phone.
OK. You know, it's a tremendous place. Did you get a tour of the place at least? I hope?
I did. Of course, of course.
Good, because that's important, that you see the quality. You know, a lot of people are saying that it's the single greatest golf course ever built. They're also saying that it's the best modern -- I am sure you have some magazine articles and things.
Of course.
So one of the very important things: We say modern, modern being from 1960. It's a great place. It's going to be great. But you know, the big play there, the big play will be building -- someday, I'm not looking to do it now, especially, I'm not looking to do it -- but you know we have a very big play to build, you know, thousands of houses, houses on the site. Because, it's, you know, it's a massive site, on the North Sea, and I'll be building -- let me put it this way: Maybe I won't do it but maybe my children will do it. But we're zoned. It's a great place. It's the oil capital. I don't know if you noticed at the airport, more helicopters are there than at any airport in the world because they go out to the oil rigs, and it's the oil capital of Europe. And it's a great, you know, it's a great place, it's a whole great thing. But it's also a future very, very big development play, if I want to do that.
So it seems like this project has been perhaps more personal to you than other projects, especially during the recession.
Yeah, this one -- well, my mother was born in Scotland and, you know, golf is a very big game, it's a great game, all of the people you write about love golf -- it's crazy. But I wanted to build something great in Europe, ideally in Scotland, and then it turned out I got Turnberry, which is where they had the British Open for years, you know, which is one of the great -- I don't know if you got to visit that. And I also have Doonbeg, which is in Ireland, which I bought during the Ireland depression, you know when things were very low and now it has become -- it's 500 acres on the Atlantic Ocean. So I actually have three --
When do you think --
OK, go ahead.
When do you think that's going to happen because originally the plan was two golf courses, 450 hotel rooms, at least 1,000 homes and six or seven thousand jobs. And the project hasn't hit those yet.
Well, I stopped it. I mean, the project is beautiful. It's like -- the road, I built the roadway in, which was a very big thing. I built the course, which is sort of like the anchor tenant, if you think of it, you know. If you think of it, it's like the anchor tenant. I built it, and it's a world-championship course, it has been reviewed as one of the best in the world. So you have the roadway. You have everything done. I built the clubhouse, that's totally complete, you saw that, and now I have all of the sites ready for housing whenever I want to build them. But, you know, I'm not going to build them now because, well -- and then I held it up because of the wind, you know, because of the windmills, because I didn't want them. I held it up because of the windmills because I didn't want to be staring at windmills, and now I won't be staring at windmills, and at some point, we'll go forward, and we'll do the rest of the job. But I'm in no rush, frankly, to do it. I did want to do, I did want to do this great golf course because there's no piece of land like it in the world and --
Right, but --
Now, did you get the reviews and everything? You probably saw Golf Week rated it at number one on the list. It's rated number one, number three in the world, number two in the world, number one. I mean, it's a phenomenal place.
I sure do. I sure do.
So let me call you back. So it's been a tremendous, it's been a tremendous development. And, you know, at some time my kids will or the company maybe will build the houses or whatever. But that's it. Why don't I call you back later, or I'll call you tomorrow and finish it up. Is that OK?
Yeah, that would be great. I would appreciate that.
OK, honey. Thanks so much.
Thanks so much. Bye.
OK, bye.
Please welcome to the program the man who is going to be the Republican nominee for President Donald Trump. Good morning Mr. Trump
Hello Don.
First of all congratulations
Hey look it has been amazing; I was just thinking when I was waiting. How long have I been doing your show with Bernard and the whole group? Bernard is a big star now with the O'Reilly stuff. You know that right?
Yes I do know that.
How long have I been doing this show Don?
35 years.
This was not supposed to be in the cards what we are doing now, but we need to keep it going that is all that it is.
So now you have to raise by your own estimation of $1.5 billion to run. Where is that money going to come from?
Well I will put in some, but I am going but you know we are going to raise a lot of money with the party. You know we have a really good relationship. You know we are having a meeting tomorrow with Paul Ryan who is a really good person by the way. Who loves the country. Who loves the party and loves the country. So I think that will be good we are going to raise a lot of money for the party and I think that the number would be probably a billion not a billion five. You know I spend money less, I am a little less on the spending. You know I spent so far like $38 million 40 million which is a lot of money but Jeb Bush $230 and you know we spend actually less than everybody else and I am in first place. So that is a good thing, I think I know how to spend it. Maybe that is why people like me as President; right?
And this meeting you are going to have Paul Ryan tomorrow. How does that work? Do you show up with your posse and he has his? Do you all get in a room or is it just you and him? Or what happens?
Well, I mean I am going to go and I am going to see and we will meet and you know I do not know Paul. I met him one time. I like him, I think he has is a good man and I really think you know probably we will come out with something that will be good. I hope. Otherwise, I will just go on the path I continued on.
You should walk in and offer him the VP spot. To throw him off.
Yeah, well I think number one he would not want it. He is doing a good job where he is. That is not any easy one to fill. That was a tough deal. The whole speaker thing was a tough deal. But you know I expect it is going to be certainly interesting and I think it will probably go well.
Mike Tyson famously said everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.
One of the great lines in history, I agree.
Talk with Donald Trump on the Imus program. Gentlemen who has been a friend of mine for a number of years -- when you were talking about him not being an American hero and not liking people who were captured he in fact as you know was shot down flying a fighter jet over north Vietnam in that manner and he has said he does not want an apology from you personally but he thinks you ought to apologize to the tens of thousands of POWS we were captured by no fault of their own.
Well I have actually done that Don and you know frankly I like John McCain and John McCain is a hero. Also heroes are people that are you know whether they get caught or do not get caught. They are all heroes as far as I am concerned and that is the way it should be.
So do you regret saying that?
I don't you know I like not to regret anything. I mean you know you say things uhhh what I said frankly uhh is what I said. And you know some people like what I said. If you want to know the truth. You know there are many people that like what I said. After I said that my poll numbers went up seven points. I mean you know.
No I understand that.
You understand that. I mean some people like what I said, but I like John McCain and in my eyes John McCain is a hero. John McCain is a good guy.
No I understand.
I also got a great lottery number which I think was 356 which is out of uhh you know I guess I do not know what the final number but it was one of the low numbers so I got.
Uhh, Don junior is a marvelous I want to offer you your son and Ivana have played a fairly significant role in your campaign to your benefit probably. So my question is there a role for them in your admiration should you get elected?
Well I do not think so. I think there is a little thing called nepotism which maybe is not a good.
Well Kennedy's brother was attorney General.
Well you are right. You are right that is exactly right but they are fantastic people. They are wonderful kids. I will always call them kids. They will always be my kids. Your boy is always going to be your child. But no matter how old he is it is one of those things. But I will say that uhh they are doing really well they will be running the business cause I will not have anything to do with the business anymore. They will be running the business and they will do a good job and you know probably do a good job. Ivana is another one she has been fantastic. It has been great.
Let me get this final question. President Obama is going to have to tread on uhh a fairly tenuous tight rope while discouraging uhh a nuclear proliferation in the world. He also has to not apologize for Hiroshima. What do you think he should do?
Well number one he should not apologize. There was a war and you know a lot of...
I do not think he is going to.
Yeah I hope he does not. He should not. He is going there does not bother me because it really shows the tremendous you know power of nuclear. You know it reminds people of this single biggest threat to the world in my opinion. Nuclear. Not global warming -- nuclear. You know Obama said global warming. I think he going there is absolutely fine. He should not apologize in anyway shape or form, but it does show the fact that you know this nuclear proliferation is a disaster. And by the way the Iran Deal does nothing to solve this problem as you know.
So 16 down one to go.
Yeah 16 down one to go. It is great to talk to you Don. You just keep up the good work ok?
All right. Well, you know somebody who is trying to make America great again is Donald Trump who joins us on the line. Donald Trump, do you think you had something to do with Budweiser changing the name of their beer for the summer from "Budweiser " to "America?"
I think so. They're so impressed with what our country will become that they decided to do this before the fact.
By the way, congratulations, you had a couple of big wins last night.
Yeah, it was great. Two great states and great people and we really appreciate it.
I just wanted to clarify, it was one-third of the people, the Democrats were asked who they would vote for between Donald and Hillary and one third of them said they would vote for you.
That's pretty good. I like that number. I really -- you know, considering they're supposed to be Bernie people and they're going to vote for me. I like that.
Just real quick, Donald. But he does better against you head-to-head than Hillary does.
Well, I know. But I never hit him, don't forget. I haven't started on him. I haven't said anything about him. I would start. Maybe I'm going to have to start, based on -- you know -- I just see he wins, wins, wins and then everybody sits around the table saying he can't win.
Well, you did tweet about crazy Bernie today and suddenly that's trending. So apparently you had some impact on him. You know, the thing about Hillary Clinton in West Virginia, though, she won by a landslide in 2008 against Barack Obama.
Right.
But the thing is, Lindsey Graham has no power. It's the President Obama who's winning or losing against is.
No, but he sets the strategy. They all set it together.
No one listens to him.
He sets the strategy and nobody listens to him. And frankly, if they did listen to him, it wouldn't get -- but he also took the pledge. And, you know -- so it's very dishonorable, you know, when you take a pledge and you don't follow the pledge. It's very dishonorable. But that's OK.
Right.
So I'm going to be extremely vigilant and careful.
But careful is one thing. But also -- you also have saluted the Kurds in the past. You also mentioned the London mayor who just won an election that you wish him the best. So, to make a swooping comment about all Muslims, that Donald trump disliking them. That's not correct either. Correct?
It's a temporary ban Brian.
All right. But you're not going to announce until the convention, why?
Because I think that's traditionally the way it's done. And I like tradition. And I think suspense is a good thing. And, honestly, right now, I'm vetting various people. And I'll make a determination before the convention and probably announce it during the convention.
OK. Donald Trump, on our email machine and the Twitter machine, you have a whole bunch of people who would like to ask you questions. Could you stick around for just a -- through this commercial break and answer some of them?
Yes, I will. Only for Fox & friends I'll do that.
They're selecting what's news and what's not in their opinion.
Well, I haven't found it, I must tell you. I have close to 8 million followers on Facebook too. And Twitter, even more. And -- but I have not found it.
OK.
I have heard about it. I have not found it.
Republican.
Well, I haven't done that yet. I had a huge victory last night in Nebraska by a lot. He's a very nasty person.
Yeah.
I mean, he's got a nasty mouth, but you know, not too many people know him. He's a nasty guy.
So, no nickname yet?
No, I have no nickname yet.
All right.
I -- I -- you know, hopefully I won't need one. Maybe eventually we'll get along, but so far he has been a nasty guy.
Good luck tomorrow up on Capitol Hill.
OK. Thank you very much.
Donald, nice to see you.
Thank you.
Congratulations on your wins last night.
Yes, it was a great evening.
Always more fun to win, isn't it?
It's much better. We've had it both ways. Much better.
All right. The Republican Party. Who is the leader of the Republican Party today? You're the presumptive nominee, not the nominee yet, and you've got the Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. So who is the leader?
Well, I would say Paul Ryan. I mean, I would really think that. I'm doing very well, I'm leading in every category and I think I'm going to have a record number of votes. I already have a record number of votes, come to think of it, and millions of votes, more than they had four years ago, many millions of votes more and I think I set the all-time record for votes gotten by a Republican candidate but I would say Paul for the time being and maybe for a long time.
Tomorrow you're going to meet with Paul Ryan and with Reince Priebus. What's the goal?
I think just unity and, you know, we'll see how it goes and I think it will go well. Paul is a good person. I don't know Paul well and I think that's part of the meeting, we have to get to know -- don't forget, he knew everybody else because they're governors, they're senators, I am a businessman and I think we want to get to know each other. I think we want to see if we have the same ideas because I represent a large group of people with very strong ideas and foundations and I think we want to see a little about that and, you know, hopefully it will work out. We're going to have a very successful campaign. The polls have been, you know, through the roof. In fact, I guess, over the last three days they've gone up amazingly. I'm now winning in Ohio and winning in a lot of places so it's been a very interesting week.
Can you have unity with Speaker Ryan when you have differences on immigration and entitlements, which are very important topics to the Republican Party and to the rest of the nation, and I think probably he thinks you should probably tone it down a bit on your language.
I think you can. I mean, you know, you always have differences. No matter what you have, you're going to have differences. If you agree on 70 percent, that's always a lot but we will have -- you know, I'm a strong border person obviously because it's one of the reasons I'm here. That's one of the reasons you're interviewing me instead of one of the people that you no longer can interview, you know, it wouldn't make sense. So, yeah, I think you can, actually, Greta, I think you can.
You mentioned those other people. Some of them signed the pledge and aren't going to endorse you or said they haven't. Your thought on that?
Well, they are dishonorable people and anybody that signs the pledge, I can think of Jeb Bush signed the pledge and he is not going to honor it, so that's a dishonorable person. Now, I would imagine he will ultimately honor it because, you know, they wanted me to sign the pledge. Everybody wanted me. I was the big one that everybody wanted me to sign.
Well, you held off at first.
You remember, with the raising of your hand and the whole thing and so I ended up signing the pledge and then these people, they don't honor it. I think that somebody like Lindsey Graham will end up signing the pledge because I actually think he is an honorable person and I think he will sign the pledge. I think that Jeb -- I don't know what is he going to do.
Going back to immigration and Speaker Ryan, I heard today that you had at least discussed a possible immigration commission, is that right?
I'm looking at it very strongly with Rudy Giuliani heading it.
Has he said he would?
I have spoken to him a little while ago. We are going to put together a group of probably five or six people -- very, very highly thought of people and I think Rudy will head it up and we will look at the Muslim ban or temporary ban as we call it and we will look at some other things on immigration and I have a lot of confidence in Rudy Giuliani.
Have you decided whether you will back off on the ban? And I realize it was a temporary ban but with an unlimited -- that temporary period could go on forever the way --
No, it was never meant to be. I mean, that's why it was temporary. Sure, I would back off on it. I would like to back off as soon as possible because, frankly, I would like to see something happen but we have to be vigilant. There is a radical Islamic terrorism problem that, you know, our president doesn't want to talk about. All you have to do is take a look at the World Trade Center, take a look at San Bernardino or Paris, what a disaster that was, and so many other locations. Just last night in Germany, look what happened on the train and it's a big problem. People -- we're going to have to solve the problem but I think by putting together a commission, a group of people that are highly respected in this field like Rudy and others, I think that could lead to something pretty good.
The ban the way it's described, even as a temporary ban would have, for instance, barred Amir Hekmati, the Marine who was over in Iran held prisoner, he wouldn't have been able to come back and the Muslims who are serving in our military overseas, they wouldn't come back.
No, they would all come back. I mean, we have exceptions and, again, it's temporary and ultimately it's my aim to have it lifted. Now, right now there is no ban but I would like to see -- there has to be an idea. There has to be something because there is some pretty bad things going on and I have Muslim friends, great Muslim friends who are telling me you are so right, it's -- there is something going on that we have to get to the bottom of it. So we will see what happens but I think by putting five, six, or seven people together that really they have expertise in the field I think that would be good and Rudy is a smart guy, he is a tough guy. He gets it. He understands the problem and he is willing to talk about the problem and he will head it up and he has agreed to do so.
All right, I don't want to beat a dead horse but so it's a ban on Muslims with exceptions and it would be temporary.
Oh, of course. Always you have to have exceptions.
OK, well the way that everybody read it was that it was across the table.
No, you'd have exceptions and ideally you won't have a ban very long. I mean, we just have to find out what's happening. I mean, you take a look what's happening -- I'm not just talking here, I'm talking about all over the world. You look at Germany, it's a mess. You look at Sweden where they have a section that they just started, it's a total mess. I mean, something has to happen.
I guess it's the constitutional implication that's, you know, that certainly is why I am pressing you on this.
Well, we'll take a look. I mean, I am -- as far as the Syrians coming, you know, thousands and thousands of Syrians coming in from the migration. We have to build a safe zone, we have to do something. I will get, frankly, the Gulf states to put up money and they will be willing to put it up, I guarantee you they will put it up because they haven't put up much right now and I don't want to spend the money on it because our country doesn't have any money. We are 19 trillion in the hole, we are going to be 21 trillion very, very soon because of the budgets that were recently passed, the omnibus budget, etcetera, and we are really a nation that doesn't have the money. We have to pay off debt, not create more debt. So we will get a safe zone someplace in Syria or numerous safe zones and we will build and we will use other people's money, meaning other countries' money -- the Gulf states in particular -- and we will do something very good but I am absolutely against having more people flowing into this country, no documentation, no papers, no nothing, nobody knows where they come from and this is what Obama is taking them, tens of thousands. Hillary Clinton wants to double and triple the effort. She wants to do it even more so and we will have problems like you have never seen before if we do that.
All right, tax returns. You said that you don't intend to release your tax returns and back in --
No, no I didn't say that.
OK.
I said I'm being audited. I'm being audited.
But what about the returns that aren't being audited?
No, no, there's a link but it goes way back.
How far back are you being audited?
I don't know. I would have to ask but long enough that it would matter and there is a link between that and other things and as soon as the audit is finished, I'd love to -- it's just a very --
Link with what?
-- a relatively simple audit and I will tell you what's unfair. Every year for many years I have been audited and I have friends that are very rich that don't get audited, they never get audited. I get audited every single year and I think it's actually very unfair.
Do you think it's deliberate, intentional? That you are being singled out?
I don't know but I know this. I have friends that are very wealthy people. I say, "How often do you get audited?" They didn't know what I meant. They were never audited. I'm audited every single year and I think it's very unfair.
If your audit goes back seven years, would you release the eighth year back? Would you be willing to do that tax return? Because the more you --
Number one, it would be meaningless. I would have to find out how far back it goes but number one, when you go back eight years, it's gets to be --
I know, but people are suspicious. But people are suspicious that you are not releasing because in January of 2012 you said to me that Mitt Romney was making a big mistake by not releasing his, so naturally that has become a flash point.
No, but he wasn't under audit. I'm under audit. No lawyer would say release it when you're under audit and these are very simple audits, it should go quickly.
I agree. I'm a lawyer and I wouldn't have someone but I figure --
If you represented me and I'm under audit and it's a routine audit -
I would tell you not to release. I agree --
You would say no release.
-- if I were your lawyer.
So the answer is hopefully before the election I will release and I would like to release. By the way, you learn very little from a tax return. You know, I have released my financials and my financials show tremendous numbers, very little debt all of that. You don't learn very much from a tax return.
And I totally agree. If you were my client and you were under audit I would say don't release them.
Yeah.
But I just think there are some years outside the audit that might be released at least to get rid of the --
First of all, if there are, they are Meaningless, OK? It doesn't matter because they are so far back but at the right time I will release them. I hope to release them, I would like to release them but when I'm under audit I can't do that.
All right, a terrible situation in Baghdad today. Three bombs went off, there were about 100 people killed, probably more will die from their injuries within a short time. If you were president today and you get the news, you get awakened, what do you do?
Well, look, the war in Iraq is a disaster. I was against it from the beginning. We should have never been there. I always have to preface it by saying that. That was bad judgment --
We're there. I mean, we have 5,000 troops there.
-- Hillary Clinton had bad judgment. She raised her hand, bad judgment on email. She has bad judgment on everything and we should have never been there. OK, now we're there, we have a crooked government, we have a government that's dishonest as hell. The money is being squandered and stolen and the oil is being stolen and everything is a mess and now they have probably ISIS going in and bombing the hell out of the place with these horrible bombs that kill lots of innocent people. It is a hellhole, it's a mess. It's something we should have never been involved in. Now we're involved. What are you going to do? You have to be very tough. You have to be very stringent but you have a government there that's totally corrupt. You have a bunch of corrupt people in that government and the whole thing is a shame.
All right, that's the problem. What do we do? We've got 5,000 troops there now and, I mean, if you were president, do you do more? Do you do less? What do you do? Or just watch?
I would get rid of ISIS but when it's not ISIS it will be somebody else. I mean, look, we have been over there so many years. We have spent probably now it's up to 5 trillion dollars in the Middle East. Five trillion dollar in the Middle East. At some point you have to get the hell out. You know, with ISIS, you will knock them out, there will be somebody else. It's going to continue to form, it's a mess and we have to get rid of ISIS. You know, they chop off the heads and they drown the people in cages and we have to do it and they blow up people -- probably this was ISIS or ISIS-related that took place in Baghdad but at some point, we have to get back to our country. Our country, our infrastructure is falling apart. Our highways, our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our airports -- they are falling apart. We are like a third world country. Five trillion dollars -- we could have rebuilt our country and had plenty of money left over.
All right, vice president. Everyone's -- I know that you haven't told anybody who your vice president is, you probably haven't made the decision yourself.
I actually haven't.
OK, good. OK, how big is the universe? Is it five or six or is it --
I'd say five or six or seven, maybe.
OK, a few more names -- any women in that group?
Actually, yes.
OK, last night, Governor Jan Brewer said to me that she thought you ought to look at governor Mary Fallin of Oklahoma. Is she one of the women?
Well, and also Jan. I mean, Jan Brewer has been fantastic. She has been so fantastic. You know, I won so big -- her territory and we won so big and she is a fabulous woman and I agree with you -- governor of Oklahoma, fabulous person.
All right, Governor Christie, is he still sort of in there?
Well, I don't want to say in there but he is helping me and he was an early endorsement and a very enthusiastic one and he is a friend of mine and he is a very good guy and a talented guy and he is helping us a lot.
All right, one last question. You told me once before you are looking for someone who has experience in government --
Most likely.
-- and I've seen a lot of that, so that hasn't changed?
Most likely. I mean, I have one that maybe could fit the role very nicely that would not be really government-related as much but I do like the concept of someone -- we are going to be passing legislation, we are not going to try to do all the executive orders like Obama. He can't get anything passed so he just keeps signing executive --
No executive orders? You are not going to do executive orders?
Well, we may be forced, we will see. I mean, it depends on what? But President Obama is signing a lot of executive orders. Nobody ever heard of an executive order before. I know Bush signed them and other people signed them but all of a sudden it's like this major event to get things done. It would be nice to go back to the old-fashioned way, it's called passing legislation, having people get together and pass legislation. So, I like the idea of somebody helping me with that, somebody very political.
All right, the convention, we hear it's going to be spectacular. Different from other conventions or the same? I mean, what can we expect?
I think it will be a spectacular convention. We're involved. I would like to actually bring some entertainment. I mean, it's -- you hear a lot of speeches and people start falling asleep after the 19th speech. So if we could bring some great entertainment. We have some incredible country and western people -- happen to love that -- but we have some great country and western people that want to come in. We have some great entertainers that want to come in. Now, some want to come in but they can't because they happen to be on the other side of the ledger. You know, it's a little bit tough, but we have some great entertainers that want to come in.
Any thought on a keynote, who would be inspiring to have as a keynote speaker?
We actually have some thought as keynote speakers and I think we are going to have a very good one, but I have to keep this a surprise, Greta. We don't want to --
I told you it's a parlor game. We're all playing guess.
I know.
I'm trying to get some clues like the parlor game.
And, you know, the vice president, whoever that may be -- and I think it will be somebody that will be very good -- whoever that may be will be announced some time during the convention. I want to keep it that way. You know, that's the way it's been typically. Keep a little suspense, at least, right?
Donald, thank you very much.
Thank you very much, Greta.
Here with reaction, 2016 presumptive -- well, he will be the Republican nominee, Donald Trump is with us. Mr. Trump, good to see you.
Hi, Sean.
Your take on the meeting. What did you think?
I thought it was a great meeting. We had a -- we discussed a lot of things, a lot of very important things, and I thought it was really a very, very good meeting. I think Paul felt the same way, and everybody else did also.
Yes. You know, maybe it's just me. There's a part of me that thinks -- I understand that people saying you're the nominee, you have the job to unite the party. But doesn't he, as speaker of the House, also have that job?
Well, I think he does, and I think he's doing a good job. He's got not an easy job, and I don't mind going through a little bit of a slow process. It's a very big subject and we have a lot of things. And I think, for the most part, we agree on a lot of different items, and we're getting there. I feel very strongly about border security. I feel very strongly about trade. I feel very strongly about building up the military. And you know, to a large extent, I think Paul is there also. So we'll get there I'm pretty sure.
Yes. But I've interviewed you a lot in this process. You say you want conservative justices to the Supreme Court. You said you'll even give us a pool of names before the election, right?
Right. I'm going to do that, yes.
Right. All right, so you're going to build a wall. That's conservative. Conservative justices obviously are. You've said to me repeatedly you want to get our budget back in balance, that you will repeal and replace Obamacare, right, likely with health care savings accounts.
Right. Absolutely. Absolutely.
And then you got -- you want to be energy-independent. You said you want to take care of vets...
Right.
Let's talk -- there was a report this week you've narrowed it down to five or six people. Is that true.
Yes, I would say that's true. That's true.
It's scary.
The jobs have been sucked out of us. They've moved to Mexico. China's taken our business. We have to get our country back to work. We're not -- we don't have any jobs! And I can do it. Believe me, that's what I do best.
And you went up against a popular governor. Yes.
Yes, I did. I mean, I did a very good job. If I would have been there for two more days, you would have seen, but we did a very good -- we got a great number in Ohio.
... good point.
... Bezos.
Yes, well, you know...
No, no. He's using -- let's -- let's -- Sean, let me...
Yes.
He's using The Washington Post, which is peanuts -- he's using that for political purposes to save Amazon in terms of taxes and in terms of anti-trust.
I actually know all about it, yes.
Yes, but I'm -- I'm talking about the emails all the time. Look, people have done, like, 2 percent of what she did, and they've paid. They've destroyed their life over it. And what she's done with the emails is horrible. Now, I hear the man that set it up and set up the server has gone absolutely rogue. So let's see what happens. But I think she's got some big problems with that. I just don't know whether or not they'll prosecute.
Yes.
I don't think she can do it.
Last question...
You see it right now, she cannot close the deal.
Would it be a good idea to put it on paper and say to your fellow Republicans, We're going to do these things, sign the paper, promise the American people. They're tired of being lied to. They're tired of being betrayed. And sign it and say, This is my promise if you elect me.
I mean, I'd have to problem doing it. I'm going to do it with the judges because I think it would make people feel better, especially people -- you know, certain people within the party that happen to be on the very conservative side.
Yes.
We're going to stop the drugs. We're going to stop the problems, believe me, Sean.
All right.
No, no. I think you're going to be very impressed. We'll come up with the right final answer, believe me.
All right, thank you, Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee. Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.
Thank you.
Mr. Trump, it's Bob O'Harrow here with Drew Harwell and Shawn Boburg. Thanks for making time for us.
Hi, fellows. How are you?
Hi. Great, Donald. How are you?
OK. I'm very good. Thank you. What is this for, the book, the book that's being written in less than a week?
Yeah, it's a tight deadline, but it's a little longer than a week. We're certainly working diligently, and --
I just hope the book could be fair because otherwise, you know, we'll see what happens. But it would be nice if the book could be fair. But we'll see.
That's our guiding light, is being fair and diligent.
I would hope so. I would hope so.
Thanks, anyway, for having us. Shawn Boburg is going to start.
Sure.
Donald, we'll just kick it off right here. And thanks again.
Go ahead.
We were talking with some critics who are saying over the years that you've been sort of obscuring your wealth when you say you're a billionaire. And looking back --
I have been what?
Obscuring your wealth when you say you're --
Well, take a look at my assets. I mean, you know, just take a look at my assets.
Well, yeah, we're looking at those. In '90 your accountant, Leventhal said you were worth negative 29million, and at the same time you said you were worth 3.7. Over the time, you know, last year you said you were worth 8.7, and then you're worth 10 billion a month later.
No, no. I am worth more than $10 billion now. If I ever sold my assets, I would get well over $1billion from my assets. I have the best assets. I have among the greatest real estate in assets in the world, including a big chunk of the Bank of America building in San Francisco, including the 1290 Avenue of Americas, including all of these buildings I own, including all of the land I own all over the world.
Right. But over the years, why have you and your accountants disagreed so many times? And why is there this level of obscurity?
No, we just -- look, I mean I've built a great company. I have very little debt. My debt-to-asset value is extremely low, as you probably noticed. I've built a great company. It's got great cash flow, tremendous cash flow. I have very little debt, and I have among the best assets in the world.
Mr. Trump -- -
The assets are disproportional because some of them are like buying a painting, like, as an example, you can almost look at any of them. You look at the land I own on the Potomac River, on the Pacific Ocean or any of them.
-- the question though is why has there been this pattern of discrepancies between what your accountants say you're worth and what you publicly say you're worth? And how do you account for those differences?
Well, what do my accountants say I'm worth?
Well, for example, in 2004 they said you were worth 3.5 billion and you said you were worth 6 billion.
Who were the accountants that said 3.5?
In the deposition that you gave under the Tim O'Brien case.
I'm just saying though that Tim O'Brien is a psycho. Tim O'Brien, he wrote a book that failed badly. It was a book -- and frankly, it was a lawsuit that I should have won. But you can't win that kind of a lawsuit. But I enjoyed bringing it anyway because it cost him a lot of money. But Tim O'Brien is a guy that knew what I was worth because he looked at some of the assets, not all of the assets. He knew he wrote a phony book and, you know, the book failed. It cost him money. You know, he's a dumb guy. He's a guy that had -- he doesn't have a clue. But he did have an axe to grind, so that's it.
Mr. Trump, let me be really direct here because I think you like that anyway.
Sure. Go ahead.
The direct question is this: in this realm of politics and the White House and running for the presidency, a key expectation is transparency. I'm going to put it to you directly. You are not transparent on your finances. How do you account for that? What do you expect people to do about your lack of transparency?
What are you --? So you think I'm worth $3 billion or $4 billion? You don't think I'm worth $10 billion.
I have no idea what you're worth because we can't discern your net worth from the documents that you released. It feels like a little smoke and mirrors. You may be worth $2 billion --
Let me just explain. First of all, I'm a private company. Right? You understand that?
Hold on. You're a private company, but you are a public candidate and there are expectations for transparency.
OK. OK. But excuse me, I have a financial disclosure form, right, which I've put in and which shows very substantial assets. The problem with it is that you have boxes. I guess I've checked many, many boxes where the value is 50 million or more, OK? And in some cases, those values are a billion or more than a billion, but the boxes say 50 million or more. I can't help it that the private disclosure wasn't meant for a person like me. It was really meant for politicians. The financial disclosure form that you obviously have was put in and it was put in very strongly to represent people, but not necessarily people that have my kind of wealth. It was really put in to represent politicians where it talks about how much is it worth. And I'm not giving you exact numbers, but I would say like 100,000, a million --
We can't know for sure. Just as in 19 --
Why? How can you not know?
In 1990 you claimed 3.6 --
Wait a minute, 1990?
We're looking at the history to try to judge the current Donald Trump. And in the past --
How can you --? I know. But 1990, that's ancient times. 1990?
If in the past --
By the way, just so you understand, 1990, that was when the depression started. That was called the real estate depression.
You're right. Let's move really quickly. I know you've been asked about this, your tax returns. You're saying you want to wait until after the audit.
Yes. Correct, as anybody else would.
Nixon released during the audit, and many other candidates have released during the audit. Your own tax attorney said that they are not being audited, the forms between 2002 and 2008. Will you release those forms?
As anybody else would do, they're all linked and I will release when the audit is finished. I have been audited for 15 years straight.
But there's no legal reason for you not to release them.
When other people don't get audited, I get audited. I think it's very unfair, but that's the way it goes. I've been audited for 15 straight years. I think it's a very unfair situation. When the audit is done -- it's routine audit. But when the audit is done, I'll release my tax returns. OK?
OK. Thank you for that. Moving on. We've also got some documents that showed you've relied heavily on your family, including your father and your siblings, for financial assistance even when you were saying you're a wealthy man and spending a lot of money. In 1981, you had borrowed $7.5 million from your father and you received a lot of trust income. You had $3.5 million in Castle chips from your father, the $1 million loan from your siblings. How did those loans square with the claims that you're a self-made billionaire?
The only reason I did that was because they got more interest by giving it to me. They got more interest by doing it with me. My relationship with my siblings is outstanding. It was everything I did. You're talking about $million and you're talking about -- during a depression, by the way. I could have gotten very easily that money from banks if I wanted it. I didn't choose to go that way. My father said, oh, let me do it, it's easy with the chips. I could have gotten the money from banks very easily and just paid back the banks just like I paid back the chips. I paid back the chips, as you know. I would have paid back the banks. I could have any one of -- many banks give me the money if I wanted to.
So why did you not get the money from the banks instead of the chips when the chips were later to be --?
As I said, it was easier. My father said, oh, I'll do this. And I paid my father interest on the loan. I paid my father interest.
You're saying your family benefited by giving you money?
Absolutely, because they get interest on the loan.
So was that in effect --
More interest than they would have gotten in CDs.
So you're saying you were doing a favor to your family?
They got more interest than they would have gotten in CDs, so they loved doing it. I could have gotten that money very easily from a bank. Within 10 minutes I would have had that money.
All right.
What year was that by the way?
The Castle loan was December 1990.
Wow, a long time ago. I would have been very easily able to get that money from other sources, if I wanted.
Your former advisor, Roger Stone, told us that Roy Cohn was more to you than just a legal advisor. You called Cohn your guide to New York City, and others have described him as a mentor. But just in your own words, how would you describe your relationship to Roy Cohn?
Well, first of all, you have to know Roy Cohn represented me on numerous cases, all of which I won. But Roy Cohn represented me on some lawsuits. Roy Cohn was a lawyer for me, but Roy Cohn also represented Si Newhouse and the Newhouse family. He represented Conde Nast. He represented George Steinbrenner of the New York Yankees, and he represented many other people in this city. I mean, Roy was not unique to me. Roy was a lawyer. He did a great job for me. He was a really good lawyer. When he wanted to be, he was a great lawyer. When he wanted to be and he wanted to be for me because he wanted to show me how good a lawyer he was. But Roy represented Si Newhouse, Conde Nast, there's George Steinbrenner --
But Roy was more than just your lawyer.
No. Roy was a lawyer. Roy was a good lawyer, but not necessarily a business person.
You described him in your book as a friend.
Yeah, he was a friend. And I have many friends. Usually my friends are business related because those are the only people I get to know.
He had a huge group of friends who were interesting, powerful, celebrity, rich folks, political folks. We've talked to some, including Alan Dershowitz who said that he expected to hate Roy, got to know him and he ended up liking him. He thought he was charming.
I can understand that.
Yeah.
Yeah. He was a nice guy, Sidney Zion. Is he still living? Is he still --
No. He passed some years ago.
Yeah, I thought he was a decent guy actually.
What about tactics, techniques? He basically had an approach that --
I understand what you mean. Roy was a tough cookie. I mean he was tough. He was a tough guy. He could be a nasty guy on occasion. He could also be a very nice guy, but he could be a very nasty guy. But he was a very effective litigator.
Mr. Trump, as you know, he was disbarred for ethical lapses. He was also your attorney. I mean, in your estimate --
Well, that was years later. That was at the end.
Right. Well, actually some of the infractions date back before he was your attorney and during the time he was your attorney. But my question is --
That I didn't know. I know, well, he was disbarred at the end. At that time Roy was sick. Actually, Roy died, as obviously you know the story I guess. I knew that he was very sick and they went after him after he was sick. I've always said if he were well, he probably would have been able to defend himself. By that time he had not much -- I don't think he represented me. I don't think he represented Si Newhouse. I don't think he represented George in the end. But Roy was very sick. I've always said that had he been healthy, he would have been able to fight that off. But he wasn't though.
So do you think that he was unethical as the bar found?
Well, I can't speak to that. I could only say with respect to myself he was not unethical. He was a very good lawyer, but he was very straightforward. He was tough, but he was ethical. I don't even know what charges he had a problem with. I can say that Roy Cohn for me was a very good lawyer, very hard driving. He did a good job. We had great success. I know at the end he had difficulties, pretty substantial difficulties. But again that was something -- I don't know what those difficulties were.
Just because we want to keep it crisp here, you have other things to do fairly soon, a couple of quick questions for you.
Go ahead.
You stuck with him through thick and thin even when he was accused of being too close to the mob. When he was accused of ethics violations and all that, you stuck with him. Some people would say that's Donald Trump being loyal. Other people would say why would he do that. Why did you stick with Roy Cohn even though other people accused him of all this crazy stuff?
Because I'm a very loyal person and we had great success. I had great success with Roy as my lawyer and I 1stuck with him. You know who else stuck with him? George Steinbrenner stuck with him, and so did Si Newhouse.
A lot of people did. There were a lot of people that went to bat for him during the disbarment.
Yeah, because they were loyal.
Before we move from Roy Cohn, tell us three things that we want to help explain you in part by your relationship with Roy Cohn, three things that you learned from Roy Cohn that you think are valuable, for you that have been valuable in your career.
Well, I learned something about the legal system and how it works because I've used Roy. Roy was recommended to me by somebody. I used Roy and I had good results. But I learned something about the legal system. I learned some good things about living life and I learned something that you shouldn't do in life because I watched Roy's mistakes in life. Roy had some difficulties in life and I had watched that. He represented me for quite some time, as he did other people, and you could learn a lot about a person both good and bad. But I would say that --
Tell us the good stuff. How did you learn how to live life well? What did he show you?
Well, he was a hard worker when he wanted to be. And when he wanted to work hard, he would do very well. When he didn't work hard -- -- I set him up with a client once. He didn't like the person. He was very oriented towards liking people or not liking people. He was a very different kind of a guy. When he didn't like somebody, he didn't like this particular client, and he really didn't care about even doing the job. He didn't do a particularly good job because he didn't care about the client. When he likes the client, when he really likes somebody -- he liked me, he liked Si Newhouse, he liked George Steinbrenner. When he liked somebody, he was very, very effective.
I guess I was getting at the last question on the Roy Cohn thing because we have other stuff we want to touch on. One can't help but think that on his public relations and legal tactics, you seemed very in-synch with his approach which is be very, very aggressive, get out there, let the world know what you're doing and so on. In other words, your rhetoric and your approach in this campaign seems uncannily like what you may have learned during the first time he represented you when the government accused you and your dad of being prejudiced or discriminatory and he was very --
By the way, they accused many of the landlords in New York, you know that.
Yes. Right, (coss-talking) and the others.
I mean there were many, many landlords. And when we settled, there was no admission of guilt.
Right. We've reported that. Yeah, we understand. But what about the tactics and the approach, the rhetoric? Did he --?
Well, I think I have a natural instinct for that. I don't think I got that from Roy at all. I think I've had a natural instinct for that. I don't think I got that from Roy. You mean going out there and being out? I think that that was not something Roy taught me. Actually, I didn't think Roy was that much out there. Roy was very strong in court and, therefore, would get publicity. But I would say that --
Mr. Trump, Shawn Boburg here. Going back to some of the financial difficulties you've had in the early 1990s, I'm just curious --
By the way, just so you understand, because sometimes it gets misreported and they always do corrections -- or usually they do. Unlike other people, many people, I never went bankrupt. Do you understand that?
Personally bankrupt, absolutely we know that.
Nor did I come close. I did take companies and renegotiate debt and do a number in I guess four times. I used the lawyers. But you know who else uses the lawyers? Carl Icahn used them. Henry Kravis used them. Leon Black --
Yeah, yeah, we got it. Mr. Trump I totally --
Wait a minute. Sam Zell used -- we all used them.
I totally get the distinction between personal and corporate bankruptcy.
But the point is that many other people at high level use them. I mean Sam Zell used them.
Mr. Trump, I'm sorry to cut you off. We know a lot about the specific deals. What I'm getting at is your sense of your own personal responsibility for the indisputable financial troubles.
I understand that. Well, I can only speak for myself. When I was representing myself, even deals that didn't work out were great deals because I got tremendous tax advantages by doing the deal. The banks would give me more 1money than the deals cost. I would walk away. And when the market went bad, I mean it wasn't me that went. The market went horrible in the 1990s. And then what I do is I've negotiated with the banks and I make the deal either good or I get other things out. I mean, I was making some great --
I'm aware of the history of Atlantic City.
I was representing myself. I wasn't representing some banker that lives on Fifth Avenue. I was representing myself against these.
And yet, even when you're representing yourself, you criticized people who predicted the financial 2troubles that your casinos would face. I'm thinking of Marvin Rothman.
No, I don't know. That story is so old and so boring. It's been written a hundred times. It's irrelevant. That was peanuts. I mean, what difference does it make? It was peanuts.
Let's stick with Marvin Rothman for a second.
Remember this, we're chaptering. You could mention a name, Carl Icahn with TWA and other things. I could give you almost everybody that you write about. I could tell you that somewhere along the line that all I did was I used the laws of the country to my benefit. Again, I'm representing Donald Trump. I made a lot of money there. What can I do? Am I supposed to apologize?
Well, there was an extended litigation of this
I mean, it's an event that was a small event. It ended up getting settled for a small amount of money. I don't really think about it. I mean, I think there was a litigation. Yeah, there was a litigation many, many years ago. It was settled for a small amount of money. Not a big deal.
Before we lose you, thank you for sticking with us on this stuff. These aren't easy questions and we appreciate your answers.
They're actually pretty easy questions.
Mr. Trump, let's talk about these debts for a second.
No. Wait a minute. No, no. The thing about exaggerating, everyone said I wouldn't be successful with this. They said I wouldn't be successful with other things, too, and I was. And by the way, I often can take things that would maybe not be successful, a market crash in the middle of a job, and I had been able to make them successful.
No. I'm saying he was very thrifty.
My father was a Brooklyn builder. Let me explain something just so you would understand. My father was a Brooklyn builder. He built in Brooklyn. There wasn't a lot of --
But this is about you. Why did you personally guarantee so much in loans?
What loan did I guarantee?
You personally guaranteed loans for the Trump Shuttle, for the Plaza up to $800 million. Some in Atlantic City. This is a lot of money.
It didn't mean very much because I didn't have to pay under personal guarantee, right? So what difference does it make? I mean it didn't mean anything.
Well, you asked a question and I'd like to answer what difference it makes.
No. But I wasn't even talking about banking because I get a loan on rate of interest.
Well, let me ask you something. Here's why all this matters. It is history, but it's relevant to a man running for presidency. You're going to be the Republican candidate. Here's the deal. You made a promise not to use junk bonds and then you used junk bonds, and so it looks like you either had no choice or you misled the Casino Control Commission, and people are uncomfortable.
Say it again. I what? I used junk bonds, what? Go ahead.
You promised not to use junk bonds in February 1988, not to use junk bonds to the Casino Control Commission. You flat out told them I will not use junk bonds, that's for stupid and failure companies.
Maybe sometimes markets change and maybe we went to them and told them we're going to use junk bonds because what happened is junk bonds became a very normal way of financing. And when I made that statement -- I don't know when the statement was made. I don't remember making it actually. But when I made that statement, if it was made at all, probably junk bonds were not a good method of financing. But over a period of time they became a very, very standard method of financing.
Right. And so while we're talking about public gaming season and financing --
By the way, you don't mind that I'm taping this conversation?
No. We're taping it as well. That's fine.
OK. Good. And so we are all on this, because I'm taping it also. Any of the financing had to be --
Sure, sure. So now you're the frontrunner of a conservative party and yet you've depended so much on government kickbacks, government financing, tax abatements.
Wait, wait, wait. You used the word government kickbacks? There's no government kickbacks. I don't know what you're talking about. What is a government --?
Tax payments at the Grand Hyatt of $40million over 40 years. Lots of millions of dollars at the Trump Tower. How do you explain that --
Well, excuse me. Wait. It was a very successful job. It was a tremendous success, the Grand Hyatt Hotel. I ended up selling it and it was a great, great success.
But you did so with a lot of public money.
What?
So have you changed your mind on tax abatements and public health for private projects now that you're --
It depends on what -- for instance, if you build low-income housing, you can't do it without help. If you do certain types of jobs, you may need that. It depends on market. It depends on the conditions. It depends on the city. If you go, as an example, into Detroit, if you want to build something in Detroit which would be very noble, you can't do that unless you have a form of subsidy, you just can't do it. Now, we could all say don't take the subsidy. Don't do it. But then you're never going to have anything built, and you won't create any jobs, and you won't create anything.
But you recognize that the rest of your party disagrees with what you're saying?
I've actually heard that. The Grand Hyatt was a great success. I made a lot of money on the Grand Hyatt. It was a beautiful job. It was one of my earlier jobs in Manhattan. But, you know, let's put it this way. If I didn't get the subsidy -- it was really a tax abatement. I don't know if that's called a subsidy, but it was a tax abatement. If I didn't get the tax abatement, the job would never have been built.
Mr. Trump, I want to go back to something and put it in the context of you occupy the White House now. So you're the president of the United States in a theoretical way here. Are you going to follow through on the approach that you 3took in Atlantic City where you said you were in it only for yourself?
No. It's totally different. No, no. That's what I was trying to point out. Look, when I was in Atlantic City I made a lot of money. And I used every trick in the bag. Always following the rules and the laws and the regulations but I used every trick in the bag. Originally, I did it -- I made a lot of money for years just running and I hit the good market. But then at the end, when the market started to change and everything else, then we hit the great junk bond market, then we hit the good taking public market. But in the end I was only working for myself. Now I'm working for the country. Now I can put skills to work that nobody else has like I have, and I can put those skills to work. We have $1trillion in debt. It's going to be $21 trillion very soon before you finish this crazy book you're writing.
It's not crazy.
Who knows? Well, it's going to be a phony deal. I know that because I mean the way The Washington Post, although I did just get a nice article. Hold it. Ah, Sheldon Adelson says I endorsed Donald Trump, from The Washington Post. I can't believe it. I'll just put it on my desk.
He's had a lot of successful casinos.
Sheldon Adelson has a lot of respect for me. Oh, I see, he wrote a nice article about me.
Hang on a second. Let me ask you this.
Wait, wait, wait. Did you see this article in The Washington Post?
The fundamental difference. I want to go to an issue about the debt. You can't renegotiate or do you really think you can renegotiate debt?
No.
People have said they thought that was nuts and --
No. The Wall Street Journal covered it very accurately yesterday or the day before -- Richard, a writer. No. It is sacred. You cannot do that. But what you can do is if interest rates go up, you can buy back debt at a discount. You understand that. But no, you don't want to negotiate a debt when it comes to the United -- -- you don't want to negotiate with respect to the debt, but you will have moments when you can buy back debt at discounts but not having to do with negotiation. For instance, if interest rates go up, etcetera. No, it was incorrectly reported by a couple. They knew they were wrong, but the Wall Street Journal covered it two days ago on the front page extremely accurately. Number one, I will 3make our country strong so the debt will be paid back. And now I'm not working for myself anymore. Don't forget when I do this I'm not working for myself. When I do this, I'm working for the people of the country. And nobody can do this better than I can do it. Nobody. But with respect to the debt, you absolutely cannot negotiate that debt. It's sacred as far as I'm concerned.
Mr. Trump, also -- I'm sorry.
By the way, these jobs have been good for Atlantic City.
Sure. Yeah. And while we're talking about you doing good, you said you're an ardent philanthropist. You said you've given more than $100 million to charity over the last five years. But when you look into the money that was given to the Donald J. Trump Foundation, you haven't donated any actual money. It's all been the golf course and I'm sure --
Well, you don't know that because I don't give most of the money to the foundation.
Where do you give it?
Some people use the foundation. The foundation is a very small part of what I give.
How much of your personal money have you given to charity in the last five years?
I think you wrote a story. I've given a lot.
How of your personal money?
If I give money through the foundation, then every charity looks at me and say, could you do this? Could you do that? Could you give me this? Because it's essentially public. I don't consider the foundation to be a major part of my giving.
So who are you giving money to specifically?
I give mostly to a lot of different groups.
Can you give us any names? One name, two names.
No, I don't want to. No, I don't want to because --
Dollar amounts at times? What --?
No. I'd like to keep it private. But the foundation is not my primary form of giving. It's a form, but it's --
What became of that $3 million you said you raised for vets but you haven't given away yet?
The money for the vets? I have given a lot of money to the vets. I gave a lot.
Who did you give it to?
I'm the only one -- a lot. I gave it to some of the people that you saw on the list, and then the rest we're giving it to other groups, another veterans groups.
You won't give one charity that you've given it to.
No. Why should I tell you? Why would I want to do that?
Well, because we want to share the word of your good giving.
Oh, you're not going to share it because you're going to put -- anything I do, you'll put a negative 3spin. I've given millions of dollars away and you make it sound like it's a negative thing and not a positive thing.
Just tell us who. We can ask and then we can share that.
You know what? Because you're so nice. No, I'm not going to tell you. I'd rather just give it and just do it my own way. It's much, much nicer. I gave you like 20-some odd groups of people that we gave it to, veterans groups. We're giving more to other veterans groups, and we've already given more.
Yeah, a little bit more about that. One question that I had was when was the last time that you visited Aberdeen?
Well, I visited a lot but now since the presidential, I haven't. As you know, Turnberry -- I'm thinking about, you know, it's under construction now but it's opening in June, and I was wondering if I should go over and cut the ribbon. Give me advice. I was wondering: Should I go over and cut the ribbon? You know, we've rebuilt the big building, it's a big hotel project and its got the great courses of the world, also, it's got a course that was a four-time Open Championship. You know, formally the British Open.
Correct.
And the question is: Should I go there in June. What do you think? Would you go there if you were me and under my circumstance? Or no? You know this stuff better than I do.
It has been reported that board members have said that.
Well, it doesn't matter what -- absolutely not. The Royal and Ancient, we worked very closely together to rebuild Turnberry, the championship course and it's totally -- yup, it will be there. It's totally, it's one of the rotas -- you know, it's in the rotas, the system.
Right.
No, no, you're talking -- By the way, don't write that because it's totally false.
OK.
In fact, we worked with the Royal and Ancient on, you know, we lengthened and modernized Turnberry and, you know, moved some holes out into the ocean, that was all done under the auspices of the Royal and Ancient -- they're the ones that have the Open championship.
OK, got it. So --
But I'm glad you brought that up.
Yeah.
There was one report, which was a totally false report about that -- no, that was wrong. OK?
OK. And when it comes to the Aberdeen golf course and development, the basic accusation that I hear from some Scottish leaders and people in Scotland is that they feel like you and your team never took the time to fully research the project or understand their laws and that you kind of bullied your way into getting things done and that now that we're a few years out --
By the way, when did I speak to you last? Tell me. When was it?
It was Wednesday, Wednesday night for a few minutes.
That was Wednesday. OK. All right, good. So go ahead because, you know, one thing happened that I just wanted to know. We spoke when? Wednesday?
Yes, on Wednesday.
OK, so go ahead. I what? I bullied my way?
Yeah, and that they feel like they made some changes that they wouldn't normally have done but they did so on the promise that this project was going to be finished, and they feel like you've let them down, that you have not --
Well, I will tell you what I have done, Jenna: I've built one of the great golf courses anywhere in the world, I think you see that, right? I don't know if you do or not, but I hope you do because that's part of the reason I'm talking to you. You saw the ratings that we've gotten, right? I think, have you?
Yes, yes I have.
People have given you and some people consider it the No. 1 modern, you know, new course in the world -- new being defined, as I told you, from 1960. That's called new in the world of golf.
Right.
So the windmills won't get built and, you know, frankly, I can start that job -- oh by the way, just so you know, I built the maintenance facilities, I built the roadway in and the roadway is like a highway -- you drove down the road, didn't you?
Yeah, I sure did. Yup.
OK, so you se the road, it's like a highway. I built the road going down to the ocean. I built the clubhouse, I built the course. The rest of it is residential and we've already started the hotel because the hotel is part of the castle. I rebuilt, you know, I totally rebuilt the castle. Did you go in the castle?
I did, I did.
McLeod House. And now what we're doing is we're going to be doing an expansion of McLeod House, in other words the concept has changed, much for the better. You know, as you own land, you get to know the land better and what works better. So the concept of what we're doing is now that we're expanding -- in fact, we're in for approvals, but we're expanding McLeod House. We're doing nicely there and we're expanding it, as opposed to building something away from it. And I don't know if you saw -- did you see plan for the expansion?
Yes, I did. Yup.
OK. And the ballroom and everything? Right?
Yup.
OK.
Right.
I mean, in all fairness, right now it's not exactly top of my mind because I'm running for president. But what I've done is made the land incredible. I mean, when you looked at the land originally, you know, it was a vast piece of land of 1,400 acres on the North Sea. Now it's a piece of land that's fully sculpted, it's beautiful, it's ready, and I can go any time I want. I just choose not to build now and one of the primary reasons is because I'm running for president.
And then another question I have is that I've noticed at a lot of your rallies -- on t- shirts, on buttons, in things that people are shouting -- a lot of your supporters are calling Hillary Clinton a bitch.
They're what? They're calling her what?
A bitch.
A bitch? No, I haven't heard that.
Yeah, I mean, there are t-shirts at the rallies and the back of the t-shirt says: OTrump that bitch." There's a popular button --
No, that I have not seen. No, I don't like that. I have not seen it, though, Jenna. How often do you go? Do you go to a lot of my speeches?
Almost every single one, and I see it more and more.
It's getting better and better?
Is that an appropriate word for your fans to be using?
I have not heard that. I don't like that. But I have not heard that. I would not be happy if I heard it. No, I have not heard it. Did you see that the crowds are getting bigger and bigger?
Where are you going next? How come we haven't had a rally?
Why doesn't the press tell the, why doesn't the press -- for instance, I have the biggest crowds. You saw Washington, you saw all of these places.
Of course.
Why does the press not show the crowds?
We do. I tweet out a photo of the crowd at every single rally.
Actually, you do. You've had a couple of the best photos -- you're a good photographer, come to think of it. But I'm talking about generally speaking, like when I talk to people that watch the speech on television, they don't see the magnitude of what I'm doing. Because they don't show the crowds. You know what I mean?
Sure, sure. One other thing that has been in the news a lot this week is that it seems like on some issues, you tend to take what feels like more than one position. And I understand that you're open to negotiating, you're open to eventually doing whatever's going to be right at that time, but I think a lot of your supporters look at your different comments and they kind of pick and choose what they want to believe. Is that going to become a problem when you need to govern? And pick one stance?
No, I don't think so, I don't think so, I mean I feel that I'm very consistent but you must have flexibility. You can't just go -- if you have a position, that doesn't mean that there is not a better alternative, and you can't have -- I've dealt with people over the years that are totally inflexible and they're never successful. You know, a lot of times things are subject to flexibility and change, and it doesn't mean -- and you know, I'm very upfront with people and I will tell people, but I think I've been extremely, I think I've been steadfast in my beliefs, actually. But with all of that being said, sometimes there is flexibility. Sometimes you want to negotiate. Sometimes, you know, etc etc. But, you know, and as you know the crowds are becoming more and more enthusiastic and bigger and bigger.
Right, right.
So, I don't know, it's been a -- so you've been there for many of the rallies, right, Jenna?
You know, I actually counted how many press passes I have, and I have 64 press passes.
How many?
Hey, someone told me a story. Someone told me that you were at Mitt Romney's election night party when he lost and that you --
When he lost?
Yeah, when he lost.
Yeah, that's true.
And that you seemed very upset. Do you remember what was going through your mind that night?
He was very upset or I was?
You were, that you were.
Yeah, no, I was upset, because he should have won. I thought that he should have won that election -- I mean, I know that he should have won that election. Had he asked me to go to Florida, you saw that I beat Rubio in a landslide, right? Had he asked me to go to Florida, like he should have, he would have won Florida. And you know, it was bad. They made a lot of errors, they made a lot of errors.
Yeah. What's the challenge for you? Is there something that you need to do to make sure that you beat her?
I think, I think that consistency in the message is very important: Make America Great Again. Bring our jobs back. Make good trade deals. Build up our military.
Donald, it's good to see you.
Good to see you.
Back in your home city of New York.
That's right.
I don't think most people thought you'd get this far. In England there's been this extraordinary story of Leicester City, football club, who were five thousand to one outsiders to win the Premier League, and they pulled it off. Are you the Leicester City of this presidency race?
That's an amazing story. I don't know. I would hope that their odds were longer than mine. I thought I had a reasonable chance.
The parallel I would use is that they were very much the outsiders to the kind of establishment teams.
Right.
The establishment teams didn't take them seriously until it was too late.
Right.
Do you get a sense that perhaps part of your great success so far has been nobody really, in the Washington elite ever imagined this could be happening?
Well, I was dealing with politicians and they're very smart. I mean, you know, they're professionals. They're governors and senators, top of the line, and otherwise they wouldn't be running. I think they did take me seriously, actually, but they would... Some would go after me early and, you know I'm a counter-puncher, and I would hit back hard. I think they took me seriously, probably some didn't.
Those same people are now saying, "All right but there's not any chance at all this man can become president of the United States." Can you?
Well, I think I can. I mean, certainly I took out some very smart people, powerful people, and we have Hillary Clinton left, and she's a very flawed candidate. She's going to be horrible on jobs. She's going to be horrible on just about every subject that I can think of. She's still a Clinton. They're formidable, but I think I'll beat her. The polls are now showing that I'm leading in some of the most important states.
We have a new mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. He's the first Muslim mayor.
Congratulations.
He's been quite critical of you, as you know. He's attacked you for being ignorant. He says that if you're president, it will make both our countries-
Let's do and IQ test. Ignorant.
He says you will make both our countries less safe. He said, "I hope Donald Trump loses the election. My message to Donald Trump and his team is your views of Islam are ignorant."
All right. Well, when he won, I wished him well. Now I don't care about him. I mean, it doesn't make any difference to me about him. Let's see how he does. I mean, let's see if he's a good mayor.
Are you offended by what he says?
Yeah, I am. He doesn't know me, never met me, doesn't know what I'm all about. I think they're very rude statements, and frankly, tell him I will remember those statements. They're very nasty statements.
He's the London mayor. He's one of the figureheads of my country.
OK.
You're now at war with my mayor, effectively.
I'm not at war. I just think it's very rude of him. I didn't (crosstalk 00:03:12).
He would argue-
In fact, just the opposite. I said, in fact I wished him well when I heard he won. He's a Muslim. I wished him well. I didn't hear this, but if you tell me he said that, I believe you a hundred percent. I think it's very... I think it's ignorant for him to say that.
What he says is that this is a response to you calling on that memorable day that we... You know we all remember, you standing there and saying, "Donald J Trump calls for an immediate ban on Muslims coming into America."
Temporary ban.
Right.
Yeah.
In the last couple of days, you've slightly tempered that, and said it was a suggestion. Let's clarify exactly what you mean. People in Britain, some people think you wanted every Muslim thrown out of the country, right. What is your actual believe about Muslims in America?
First of all, I'm not the president. Everything's a suggestion. We have a tremendous problem with radical Islamic terror. We have a tremendous problem. If you look at it worldwide, the world is blowing up. It's not people from Sweden that's doing the damage, OK? We have a real problem, and we have to discuss it. I have many Muslim friends. They come over. Not all of them, I have to say, but I was with one the other day, one of the most successful men. He's Muslim. He said, "Donald, you have done us such a favor. You have brought out a problem that nobody wants to talk about."
You're not anti-Muslim, right?
Absolutely not. I am not.
How would you categorize what you feel?
I'm anti-terror. I'm anti... There's something going on that's not good. There's something going on that's very bad. There's something that you're not understanding. Maybe the mayor of London is not understanding.
David Cameron has refused to retract what he said about your comments about Muslims. He says, "They were stupid. They were divisive, and they were wrong." What's your response?
Honestly I don't care. It doesn't matter. I mean, it's fine.
If you're president, and he's the British Prime minister.
It looks like we're not going to have a very good relationship. Who knows? I hope to have a good relationship with him, but it sounds like he's not willing to address the problem either. People can pretend like it's not existing, but take a look. Take a look at London. Take a look at certain sections of some cities throughout Europe and throughout the world. It is a disaster. The police are, you know, they want nothing to do with it. It's as bad as it gets. Now, we don't have to talk about it, or we could. I will tell you this-
Would you like David Cameron-
Whatever's brought up-
Would you like him to withdraw the particular the comments that you're stupid, divisive, and wrong with your view about Muslims?
Well, number one I'm not stupid, OK? I can tell you that right now. Just the opposite. Number two, in terms of divisive, I don't think I'm a divisive person. I'm a unifier, unlike our president now. I'm a unifier. I'll say this. When I made the statement six months ago, and there was a clamor only by the politicians, millions of people were calling in saying, "Donald Trump is right." You know that, and so do I. People that live in Great Britain and people that live all over the world were saying, "Donald Trump is right."
The problem with taking such a position is that you get a lot of decent, law-abiding Muslims who feel really offended-
I'm sure they agree.
They feel targeted and under attack. What can you say to them?
Here's what I say to them. They have to turn the people in. People have to work with the police and law enforcement. They have to turn them in. They're not turning them in. They've got to play ball. Now, if they're not going to play ball, it's never going to work out.
If you had your time again, given how divisive and controversial it's been, would you rephrase what you said about banning Muslims from America? Have you ever thought about that?
It got people thinking. Whether it's good for me or bad for me, I don't really care. It got people thinking. You have to understand, I'm not against any religion, but there is something happening there that's not, there's something bad going on there. There's something very bad going on there. We have to get to the bottom of it.
It has been a long nine months.
It has been a long time, I agree.
Let's talk a little bit about litigation, because you -- you have threatened to sue many people in the course of the campaign. But, of course, if you wind up president, you are not going to be able to do that either. Can you go four years without threatening to sue anybody?
Well, what China has done to us has been -- maybe you do the world -- you know, you do have methods of suing countries, OK?
It's going to be a busy law firm.
No, no, it's going to be busy, but it's a little different. And it's also a tactic for me, it's a business for me, and I've been successful, and I've, you know, used litigation. And sometimes I use it maybe when I shouldn't, and sometimes I don't.
Have you made any mistakes in this campaign? You had said publicly you thought the re-tweet about Heidi Cruz was a mistake. Let me just...
Well, I said I could have done without it, to be exact. I mean, I could have done without it.
But it was a mistake, wasn't it? I mean, that -- you shouldn't have done that, right?
I wish I didn't do it. Although, you know, I guess you could say she's fair game because she's very much involved with the campaign. But I don't know --
But that's when you mocked her looks.
-- she just seems like a nice woman. You know what? I have millions of followers @realdonaldtrump. I have millions of followers, I have millions of Facebook...
I'm familiar.
Yes, you are. But the thing that gets me in trouble is re-tweets. The re-tweet is really more of a killer than the tweets. The tweets I seem to do pretty well with.
So that's one, the Heidi Cruz thing. Let me just give you like a list of a couple of times, whether you have any regrets on it.
Sure, go ahead.
I want to talk a little bit about your family. Your older brother Fred Jr. was an alcoholic and died at a relatively young age. When I say his name, what does that bring up for you?
Well, he was great. He was the most handsome person. He was a really smart guy. Really, really smart guy. He had everything. But at a certain age, he started drinking a little bit, a little more, a little more, and ultimately it was a big problem. And he'd say, don't ever, ever drink and don't ever -- and I'll tell you what, I've never had a glass of alcohol.
Never?
I have other problems, OK?
You've been divorced twice.
Yes.
I'd give it a try.
No. But even if they said, you'd have an even better relationship with your husband, I hear it's just great, but you know what I mean, I don't know that you'd be able to do that.
You tell me if I am wrong. I feel like you are trying to get out of bounds on the emotional question to the subject of alcoholism, which we discussed. Has it happened that somebody has done something to you? You know, not a death in the family. But has done something to you, to wound you?
Well, you know, I don't know -- I can say this. It would be something I could certainly think about and, you know, come back with an answer. I'll write you --
No, it's OK, I mean...
But I will say this. When I'm wounded, I go after people hard, OK? And I try and "un-wound " myself.
Most kids between the ages of 6 and 16 have been bullied at some point in their lives. Were you ever bullied?
No, I wasn't. But I have seen bullying. And bullying doesn't have to just be as a child. I mean, I know people are bullied when they're 55 years old.
It can happen when you are 45.
I mean, it's -- it's -- you know, it happens, right? But you've got to get over it, fight back, do whatever you have to do.
Let's talk about us.
OK.
We were always friendly.
Right. Good relationship.
Afterward, you said that you didn't feel that the moderators had been nice. But do you think it's the journalist's role to be nice to presidential candidates at a debate?
No, fair. I don't care if they're nice.
You used the word "nice."
Well, OK. No, I don't think so. I mean, I might have said they weren't nice, but that doesn't mean they have to be nice. I mean, I've known many...
You know it's not a cocktail party.
No, no. I'll tell you what, in a certain way, what you did might have been a favor, because I felt so good about having gotten through. I said, if I can get through this debate, with those questions, you can get through anything.
You seemed to stay angry for months.
Yes.
And this is the first you and I have ever discussed what happened...
That's true.
... between us, over the past nine months because you and I did not talk about that at our meeting.
We never discussed it. No, we didn't discuss it.
But you know what I am saying. When Donald Trump...
I do.
... targets somebody and says, this person is bad, that person is bad, it creates a firestorm in those people's lives. And many of these people are so-called civilians who haven't put themselves out there as public figures.
But it's in response to something that they did, or it's in response to something...
I want to talk for a minute about the tweeting.
OK.
Set the scene for me because I know where I was when I was on the receiving end of a lot of those tweets, but I've always wondered where you were. I'm picturing, like, a crushed velvet smoking jacket, you know? Chez lounge, slippers...
Maybe not as fancy, but it'd be probably a lot less.
Walk us through it. You said it's you if it's past 7:00 PM in the evening.
This weekend I picked up 114,000.
What do you do -- do you pick up your iPhone and actually...
... Yes...
... actually tweet yourself...
... Yes, after 7:00 or 8:00 I'll do it myself. But during the day, if I'm in the office, I have a number of people that I'll just call out a tweet to. It's just always my writing.
You call out, "Exclamation point"?
I do. I say, "exclamation".
... You retweet some of those, it's not just the fans.
Yeah, but not the more nasty ones. You would be amazed at the ones I don't retweet.
Bimbo?
Yeah, that was a retweet. Did I say that?
Many times.
Oh, OK. Excuse me.
It's not about me. It's not about me, it's about the messaging...
... No, no, I understand. No, no...
... To young girls, and to other women...
... It's a certain amount of fighting back. You know, it's a modern day form of fighting back. I mean, it really is.
Now you have my cellphone number. That is actually much more efficient...
... I do -- You gave me your cellphone number.
And, you promised you would not use it for evil?
I promise. You'll never see that, you'll never see that.
You still have a lot of states to go.
And we have a lot to go. So it's been such an honor. It's been a lot of fun. And it must be because I do your show. I think that might be it.
Today was a very big day. You have a list of names.
I do.
And you had talked to me for a while now about releasing these names, your judicial philosophy. You said you wanted originalists. You said you wanted people like Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas on the Supreme Court.
It's true.
It's gotten...
He endorsed me.
It's gotten very good reviews.
He's gotten great reviews.
By the way, Thomas Lee of Utah is related to Mike Lee.
Brother.
So this is your judicial philosophy.
Yes.
You...
That's right.
... you know, one of the things I think people have questioned -- I have interviewed you a lot during this process, and you gave me very specific things. And one of the top things I would ask you often is your judicial philosophy. You mentioned, as I said, Scalia and Thomas. They are what we call originalists.
Right.
Constitutionalists.
Correct.
This will have an impact for generations to come.
Oh, generations. And I will say, if Hillary Clinton, who's doing very poorly in this whole rigged system that...
We'll get into that.
... that Sanders happens to be in...
Yes.
... but if Hillary Clinton, for some reason, wins, your country will never be the same because she's going to put disasters on the Supreme Court. So these are -- these are the names.
This is interesting because I think there might have been some people -- I -- I've talked to people on the radio show. And some people said, well, Donald Trump's a recent covert to conservatism. And I asked you very specific question. For example, you know, you say -- do you want a balanced budget?
I do.
Yes. You know, this is, I think, the most important thing, as you now transition to the general election. You talked about very specific things. And I think when you look at all the exit polls and 65 percent of Republicans feel betrayed by the Republican Party that they haven't kept their promises...
I felt betrayed.
I felt betrayed, too.
One of the reasons I'm doing this.
Yes.
I mean, I had a very nice life. I had a very simple life. I have this great company. I have a wonderful family. I complicated my life, that I can tell you, although I'm having a good time doing it. But no, I'm having a good time...
You want fair trade. You're not a protectionist. You want better deals.
I want fair trade.
Yes.
The problem with fair trade -- the people we have now are incompetent. Our president is -- you know, he -- he used a word the other day, not a nice word, but he's an ignorant president. He's an ignorant president. He doesn't know what's going on, in my opinion, OK, and the opinion of plenty of other people.
I've been on it many times.
We don't have anything. We're like -- we've become a third World country. I'll tell you what...
I want to stay on this focus, though, because you made a promise to release the names so people would know your judicial philosophy.
Right.
You're making a promise to balance the budget. You're making a promise to build the wall. You made a promise you're going to repeal "Obamacare'...
A hundred percent.
... and replace it with...
We have no choice.
Replace it with?
By the way, you don't even have to repeal it. We're going to do it before it happens.
Are these promises...
Don't let anybody change that date.
And you want to replace it with health savings?
Oh...
It's huge.
Unless you're dead...
Five thousand...
Unless you're dead or in the process of almost death, you can't use it.
What I'm trying to get to is, is with the release of this -- these names -- that was a big promise. Balancing the budget is a big promise. Building a wall is a big promise. Repealing Obamacare  is a big promise. I understand you're giving a speech next week on energy independence.
Right.
That's a big promise.
In North Dakota.
... Carrie Prejean and a woman that actually came from war-torn Bosnia that worked for you and ran a lot of -- was a vice president...
Right.
... for you, Sunnata Adsam.
Right.
Yes.
... because they were written about and they were furious...
Are you demanding a retraction...
... more than I do.
I speak from experience.
You are -- you are shunned. No, no, I'm telling you...
But this is going to be the campaign. This will -- the Clintons...
Oh, I know.
... are known for being very dirty.
But the good thing about this, this sets the table. You know, this sort of sets the stage. People have seen this. People have seen Carrie. They've seen Rowanne. They've seen others now that are coming forward that were mentioned in that story, which, frankly, wasn't even that bad, if you want to know the truth. It's not like I -- I hope that people that haven't read it...
I tell my kid that all the time.
How do you compare that against Clinton, OK, what Clinton has done?
And rape.
And big settlements, massive settlements.
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars for Paula Jones.
And lots of other things. And impeachment for lying.
You're going to give this speech on energy. I think energy independence is a key to jobs, and I don't want to be dependent on countries that hate our guts for oil.
A hundred percent.
Is it going to be coal, fracking?
It's going to be coal. It's going to be fracking.
Let me go to Hillary. She keeps saying -- I know you released your financial statements again.
Right.
She wants your tax returns.
Yes.
You have talked about her connection to Wall Street and big banks. She has given speeches where she has made, in one hour, more than what Americans -- the average American will make in five years...
Right.
... economically. She won't release her speeches.
Well, they've just announced they made, like. $7 million just now...
... should release them?
I think the speeches should be released, but I don't know, you know, what she's doing. I -- I know what you're probably going to see is really, really negative statements having to do with who's she's running against right now, Bernie, because I would imagine she made very positive statements toward Goldman Sachs and all the people that paid her all this money.
You know, look at David Petraeus.
Look at Petraeus. Look at many others. And it looks -- by the way, it looks like she's being protected by the Democrats. I mean, it looks like she's being totally protected.
Well, I don't know when this is ever going to end. This is the longest investigation ever.
It looks like it will never end.
He was --
I won everything. And he was just condemned by the party --
It's all about electoral votes now. You need to get to 270. You've been through all of these states now. What states will Donald Trump put in play that maybe somebody else wouldn't?
So if I run, we're going to have a lot of additional states. If let's say Ted Cruz. I say it with respect, but let's say Ted Cruz or somebody else got the nomination, they had a little tiny group of states --
New York and New Jersey.
I think New York might be in play. New Jersey, I think I'm going to do great in New Jersey. These are states that other Republicans wouldn't even go to.
You said something last night. You said if I didn't fight as hard as I fight, I wouldn't be here today.
Well, I think that's true.
Is that the same for the general?
No, I think that's true.
You'll fight that hard.
It's the same. Look --
It has to be.
You have to be true to yourself. I mean you're -- I was a good student. I'm like a smart person. And, you know, you listen to things, it's so tough. If you're a Republican, especially if you're a conservative Republican, what you go through is incredible. I even talk about my uncle was a professor at MIT, just a highly, highly respected intellect. I mean, I come from a very smart family.
Yes.
I like to talk about it because conservatives are abused. They're abused by the media, falsely abused, but really abused by the media. But I put so many states into play, Michigan being one, Illinois. States -- I'll tell you what, the state of Washington, I was in Washington last week, the state of Washington. We had crowds that were the biggest they've ever had. They've never had crowds like that. They said it was like an Elton John came and we broke that record. Oregon, nobody would even think about Oregon. I'm going to campaign there. These are states that are locks for the Democrats.
It almost reminds me a little bit, the crowd size, enthusiasm of Obama in 08. Do you -- do you feel --
I do. I went to California. Everyone said California, give it up. I'm not going to give it up. I'm going to play California. Now, maybe I won't win and I know the odds are against me and all that. We went to Costa Mesa last -- two weeks ago. We had 31,000 people. It was a record for this incredible amphitheater. We had 31,000 people. Nobody has ever seen anything like that.
We've got to take a break, though.
Good.
That's my job.
But that's your job. But -- and you do it well. But I really have a group of great people.
Is there one or two that really are in your mind --
Or three maybe.
Maybe three --
Yes, yes, three that I really think a lot of.
And you want somebody that's, you said, connected to Washington.
I want probably -- and we have a couple of other alternatives. But I want somebody ideally who's very political, who's very strong with getting legislation passed. I'll be -- I'll do great with our trade deals and with our business and with a lot of that. And we're going to make our country rich again. We're going to make our country strong again. But I want somebody that can deal with Congress, can deal with the Senate, can deal with our Congress people so that we can get something passed. You know, Obama signs his executive orders all day long because he can't get along with anybody. It's not the way it's supposed to work, as you understand.
You're not a conventional candidate. This has not been a conventional campaign in any way. I asked you the last time you were on about potential key rivals. Look at the people that are supporting you -- Rudy Giuliani, Chris Christie, Newt Gingrich, Ben Carson, Rick Perry endorsed you on my show.
Right.
Bobby Jindal, Jan Brewer. What about announcing some other positions, Secretary of State, secretary of defense?
We may do that and --
Homeland Security.
Some of the people on that list, not all of the people, but some of the people on that list I really like and I think will be fantastic when given the right. I mean I've seen Rudy. Rudy has been a fan for a long time. I think Newt has been incredible. I just spoke to Newt, actually, about something, and he has great ideas. I'll tell you what, there's no -- there's no lack of ideas coming out of Newt Gingrich.
Funny, they come 24-7.
He's a great guy.
All right, let me go through the scandals, because you said about Hillary, she's totally controlled by Wall Street. You got the Clinton Global Initiative literally that they're funneling money to a friend. That broke. You obviously have the email server scandal. You've got the Benghazi scandal. You have the abuse of women scandal. She said that she is going to appoint Bill Clinton to --
Yes.
-- run the economy. Isn't that the job of the president.
Well, first of all, Bill Clinton is the one that signed NAFTA. In the history of our country, that's been the worst trade deal ever.
So in other words, they're buying influence.
Well, the press isn't covering it. I mean, to me, that's possibly, I don't know, the email to me, this -- you know, when you talk about national security, that's about as clear as it can get.
Well, it certainly bought their silence.
What did all of these countries and others get in return for paying millions of dollars for speeches? They got a lot.
Why do they protect the Saudis. The Saudis have been duplicitous -- I understand they're Sunni and we've got to battle them against the Iranian Shia. I understand that. But don't we need to hold them accountable a little more than they've been held accountable?
Well, I look at it also differently. We protect the Saudis, we protect many countries. We are -- we're the military for many countries, and they don't pay us. And they don't pay us what they should be paying us. Do you know what the difference they -- of our -- of our country, if somebody like me can go in and very nicely say folks, you've got to pay up, because the Saudis wouldn't be there for two weeks if we weren't there protecting them.
And they're tear driving the prices of our energy down to drive our fracking business out of business.
Or whatever. Maybe they are. I really don't know that for a fact. A lot of people think that. I will say this. We are spending billions and billions and billions of dollars protecting nations all over the world, and many of them aren't paying up. If I get them to pay up, just fair, fair, if I get them to pay up, our country is already a different place.
Has it sunk in, you can now be the president of the United States? Are you ready for that?
It's such a responsibility. Somebody just left my office, actually, and said do you have any idea what going on here where it's such an incredible responsibility. And it is. I have a great responsibility and I'm doing this with the people. We have a movement going on. I go and make a speech in California or wherever I go, Illinois.
Who is going to build the wall?
Who is going to build the wall? We're going to build, believe, and Mexico is going to pay for the wall. But it is a movement and a beautiful thing to see. These people, the people love this country.
Mr. Trump, thank you very much. Good to see you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, appreciate it.
Thanks.
We saw your Instagram video. Did you turn that up?
Oh, that just came out? Yeah. How was it? Did you think it was interesting?
It definitely got people talking.
I can imagine.
Was it your idea?
Yeah. That cost me two dollars, right?
Yes.
I must say running the election, I've spent less than anybody else and obviously had the best result. I have less people working for me than anybody else. Obviously, I'm doing better than anybody. Everybody would've said I watching me. It turned out to be just the opposite. In fact, the end, there was actually a couple of things reported by the Washington Post and others that not only will the convention go to July, but it could be a new convention in August, which I guess happened one time or something in the history of the country where it didn't even get solved. Here I am. I had the big Indiana; well, big New York; big Pennsylvania; Maryland, you know, the whole thing. Then on top of that, the big Indiana and everybody said, no mas.
Thanks. I will. I try to be fair.
I appreciate that.
Tough when I need to be. We're working on one of the chapters of the book. It has to do with how you won. As an opening question, as you look back on all this -.
process.
Give us the third turning point. Then we got some specific points.
A third turning point was a little bit Iowa, because I wasn't given proper credit in Iowa.
How do you mean?
I'll tell you. I came in second in Iowa. I should have come in first. My team was not as good as -- I 'm a very good manager. And I had a team that frankly I believe that I won -- but you know I'm not a big fan of the caucus system. When people walked in, they had lots of people on the other side trying to turn these people around. Yet I came in a very strong second. I got no credit for it. Marco came in third. They were saying, it's like, great. I said, well, what about me? I came in second. I've never done this before. It did awaken me to the nastiness of politics. People would walk in wanting to vote for Trump. They were just you know that -all sorts of false things. They also did a very unfair number on Ben Carson where they said he has left the race, he has left the race, because I should have won. I learned all about politics in one evening. I learned a lot about politics in one evening, the dirtiness. I also learned that I should have been given credit. I have never done this before. That's the first election I was ever in. I came in a very strong second.
So are you angry about that?
I'll tell you. I never got credit for another one at Wisconsin. I got almost 36 percent in Wisconsin. Cruz got 40 something percent. Yet the entire establishment, millions of dollars were spent. The radio hosts were totally against and the governor's entire machine was against me. Somebody should have said I did a really good job to get a number like that. I never heard that, which was interesting. But let me go back to this other point. So I did really well in Iowa. I was not given credit for it, but I learned a lot about politics in Iowa and I'm OK with that. Then I went to New Hampshire and did unbelievably well because I was not expected to win New Hampshire. I won going away.
You raised your hand. The only one.
It took courage.
Put us inside on both of those? How did you come to do both of those things?
Well, on the raising of the hand, we'll start with that, that was an interesting moment because I had no idea that was going to happen. And if you remember, that was a very big crowd not only because it was the first debate but it was in the arena. It was in a basketball arena that they had cut, and so we had a massive audience and we had thousands of people. And they were Republicans and they were people that wanted to unify and these were people that wanted to see the pledge signed or whatever. way that question might have been tougher than Megyn's question. But raise your hand. And I'm the only one that raised my hand. Now, the question wasn't meant for anybody else in the room. It was only meant for me because the other people in the room didn't really pertain to them, right?
Right.
So I raised my hand and I got a lot of credit for it. I got a lot of credit for raising my hand. Although the audience -.
The audience didn't give you credit -.
No, they didn't. They didn't actually. It's funny they gave me great credit as I went through the debate but they really went wild on that one. But it wasn't -.it was sort of a laughing negativity as opposed to an angry negativity. I could see that. I could feel that. It was a little bit of a laughing negativity, Dan. It wasn't great anger. They understood. They got it.
But at that point in your candidacy, you were not convinced that the party would treat you fairly?
That's correct. And that was before I was doing well. Let's see. Was I on center stage? Just about, yeah.
You were at that point.
So I've been on center stage every single debate when you think of it. I've been on center stage every single debate. And one of the things I was very insistent, although it didn't always work out that way is that I always wanted an odd number because if you have an even number, you're not on center stage. You're sharing center stage with somebody for your thing, but I always fought for an odd number. I said, wait a minute, I'm on center stage. I'm winning by a lot. I'm winning every debate. And if you give me ten people, like sharing it with somebody that doesn't belong. So I fought it. I'd usually win that. But I've been on center stage every single debate if you think of it. And you're right, I didn't think about that. But on the first debate, I was on center stage too. So I did raise my hand and that was -- I think it was something that was respected by the audience. There was some booing but it was friendly booing if there's such a thing. But it was friendly booing. They were laughing. They were booing. Everybody understood exactly what I meant. And I did the right thing. It would have been much easier just to keep my hand down. Don't forget that was like -- was that the first or second?
About the decision to talk about -- on immigration and Mexicans sending rapists and murderers.
Yeah. The interesting one on that is that if you got a copy of my speech, we sent out a copy prior to it. Reading it, I'd say, wait a minute. Beyond that question, I didn't want to do that speech.
You didn't want to do it?
No, I didn't.
That's what I mean.
In fact, I said, wait a minute. How long do we have until the general election? Because if this is the case, that was beyond anything. And I've been a very public person for a long time. That was blowback like I've never had before. And I said to myself, let's see, it's June, so we had a-year-and-a-half before the general. I said is every day going to be like this? I was being inundated. We're having hundreds of calls.
And then you were in a fight with Univision over it. And then you were in a fight with -.
Well, the Univision turned out to be excellent because I ended up selling the Miss Universe contest because of that whole thing. I probably wouldn't have sold it; it was a great number.
Right. But you were in a number of things which it was affecting your business relationships.
Sure. It affected Macy's. I had a deal with Macy's, not a big deal but it's a deal. The head of Macy's was one of my best friends named Terry Lundgren.
Did you think at that point ...
haven't spoken to him since. But he bailed on me. I couldn't believe it. I actually couldn't believe it. And I said, what's the big deal? He said, "Well, you know, the Mexicans are planning to boycott." I said, "You had boycotts before. They last for about two hours and forget it." "Are they're going to picket the store." And the ties did well. The shirts did well. But it wasn't a big business or anything.
Did it give you any second thoughts about maybe this is really not the right thing for me to do?
No. I have to do what I have to do. It turned out I was right. Illegal immigration is turning out to be one of the truly big stories of this campaign. You know that better than I do. So it turned out I was right.
But at that moment, were you convinced of it? Or did you have to -.
No. I didn't know. I didn't know. I'll tell you what, Dan. I got hit so hard. And it was sort of like the delayed. Did you ever watched George Foreman knocking out -- when he hit Joe Frazier, where he hit him? And about two seconds later, Joe went up in the air. It's almost like a spring. He hit him. You know what I'm talking about.
Yeah. I do remember now, yeah. thing if it was the day after the speech. But it was a week later.
It's almost like people started reading the speech a week later. And that was really, really brutal. A couple of weeks went by and then what happened is people started looking at the incredible crime statistics, how bad it is. In fact, let me -- could I have the report on Mexico, please, that I just got? You've got to see this report. It's unbelievable.
When did you know that that was a message that resonates? Was it when you got the first batch of polling back or out of -.
Well, that's a very good question.
Do you think it was over?
Here's Mexico travel warning. You take it back and read it. "U.S. citizens have been victims of vicious crimes, violent crimes such as homicide, kidnapping, carjacking, robbery by organized criminal groups in various Mexican states. This is just out.
From whom to whom?
United States Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs. "The Mexico-U.S. traveler should be aware that the Mexican government has been engaged in extensive to counter organized criminal groups." This just came out recently. It's unbelievable. I'm going to leave it. You can have it here.
I think there may be six counties that you didn't win.
Well, you check it out but pretty close to it.
You're right.
I'll say almost every county of every state, nothing like that has ever happened before. So I'm going to make a heavy play for New York. And one of the things I tell people, one of the things I've been saying to people is that let's say Ted Cruz got in or somebody else. They have their six states they have to win. Boom, boom, like cookie cutters, right? And if they lose one of them, it's gone. I think I have 15 or 17 maybe. I was in the state of Washington. We had turnouts like you wouldn't believe a week-and-a-half ago. Now, I was told the state of Washington is not in play for a Republican but I think it's in play for me.
Right.
In fact, I was asking my people the other day, Jenna. So I've had blowback from a lot. The blowback from the initial assault on Mexico -- and it wasn't an assault. I said they are sending. It's true. The government of Mexico is very smart. They don't want them. People are being sent. In other words, instead of being here, go ahead to the United States. Let them take you.
What was the difference on the Muslims ban frame?
It just wasn't as intense nearly.
And a lot of people think that it was just kind of a quick decision, but there were several days of planning that went into announcing this.
No. It's a fairly quick decision.
But was this something that just kind of came to you? We have to do something and here's what we have to do?
Yes, it was. It absolutely was. I said we have a problem. We have a president that won't even mention the term. And we had San Bernardino where they were radicalized. They became radicalized. He probably became radicalized by her. And they killed 14 coworkers that had previously given them a shower party for their baby, a baby shower for the baby. And a they killed them. And they killed more -- they had many people still in the hospital. And then you had the horror show of Paris where 130 people killed and many, many people in the hospital right now that will never fully be able to recover. And obviously many other things, many other things. So I said something has to be done. So I said we're going to call for a temporary ban on them coming in. And you also had the whole thing with the migration starting to form where people are starting to think about let's let a lot of people come in from Syria, even though we know nothing about them, who they are, etcetera, etcetera. But they do have cellphones. And they do have ISIS flags on some of those cellphones. And you say, what are we doing? I don't know if you know but a lot of the cellphones had the ISIS flag on them. And we let them into our country. So I said it's time we get smart.
So here's a question related to that. You saw the kind of reaction of the pundit class or part of your Republican establishment either attacking you or reservations.
A lot of them attacked and didn't believe it probably.
Right. But at the same time, you're seeing the reaction among people you talked to.
Right.
What does that tell you? Does that give you confidence as a candidate that you understand something that so-called smart people don't?
Well, I gained that before because I must tell you, I've had good instincts in life, and a lot of this is instinct. You talked about three moments of -- I mean, I could tell you, one was when Charles Krauthammer and others, many ever assembled in the history of the Republican Party. They said that. One said since World War II. It's a long time. But they said, literally, there has never been a group of such talented people. This is the single greatest group of people. And I hadn't announced yet. I'm saying what am I doing? These people are saying this group. Why am I doing this? Because I don't know most of these people. But I did it anyway. And now, I say, really? Tell me about it. So you have to go by your own instinct. You can't listen to the pundits. I mean, I watched this poor guy, this poor, sad guy who's on television all the time talking about the party, the magazine. What's his name? Bill Kristol. I watched this poor guy. He's called it wrong for two years. "Trump will never run. He's never going to run. It won't happen. He won't run. He won't run." I'm running. Then, "He'll never file papers. It won't happen. It won't happen. And if he does, he'll ask for two 45-day extensions." I filed my papers. Whereas, guys with a one-day financial page asked for extensions, I didn't and I have over a hundred pages. I watched these people. And they're sad. I mean, he's a sad guy. I watched him the other day on television, "Well, we haven't given up." But here's a guy who has been wrong about me for a-year-and-a-half from before I ever announced. "He'll Then I filed my papers. My papers are great. By the way, those papers, I filed my new ones and I got pretty rave reviews on that. I have very little debt. I have phenomenal assets. Those are the papers you'll learn something about somebody. You don't learn them from tax returns just so you understand. And I'll file my tax returns when the audits are finished, and they're routine audits. But those are the papers, Dan, that you'll learn something. I filed, I guess, it's over 100 pages. One hundred and four pages of deal after deal after deal. Good ones. They don't even talk about, oh, this one on page 87 maybe wasn't so good. I actually take good deals. I've taken what should be bad deals because the market collapsed and made them great deals, sometimes better than if the market didn't collapse.
So are you saying that in August once you went ahead on the polls, you said, "I know I'm going to run"? Or was it -.
No. I think when I won New Hampshire.
Why didn't you say to yourself, well, they're watching because I'm a reality TV star, not because they want me to be president.
I should have said that. I didn't feel that. And Variety. It's all over the place. Variety said, "The Trump debate." They called it, "The Trump debate scores record ratings." Then two weeks later, "The Trump debate gives CNN its biggest to date." They only referred to them as the Trump debate. And, you know, years before those debates used to be an afterthought. There weren't even things that got decent ratings on television. In fact, there was a point where the FCC made the television networks put them on. The networks didn't even want the debates. And now they've become like massive television. They say the debate, if it's Trump and Hillary, is going to be Super Bowl numbers. It will be the highest -- you know what, which is a good thing for the country because the country has always had malaise. It's never been the voter turnout. They say voter turnout will be the highest in the history of the country. That's a good thing. And they say that the debate will get the highest numbers, I mean it will be like massive numbers.
You alluded to feeling as though you didn't get enough credit in Wisconsin. But that was an important loss and you obviously -.
It made me fight harder in New Hampshire. I'm sorry, it made me fight harder in my next group of contests.
You must have been down that night. down. But I think I was not given -- two events took place which were interesting. I think I've been treated very unfairly throughout the process. But I think I did really well in Iowa although I should have won. And it made me realize that management -- it's not just the voters going in. It made me realize that management of an election is very important. Because I'm telling you, I had more voters walking through those doors wanting to vote for Trump than Ted Cruz. But he had a massive group of people inside grabbing everybody and giving lots of false stories of my positions and bringing them over. For whatever reason, I didn't have that. So I learned something. But I still came in a strong second. And it's 17 people. So I came in second then I was like, "Trump loses." I came in second. But Rubio -- you remember that story -- Rubio became a star because of that. And the other one was Wisconsin. I had great audiences in Wisconsin. We had tremendous crowds. I thought I was going to win Wisconsin. Everybody said you can't because the governor and the machine were against you. You had the five radio hosts that were against you. It was a whole lot of things we were against. But I had the biggest crowds by far. And I thought, OK, so I got almost 36 percent. instincts failed.
They didn't fail me.
But you're somebody who knows the difference between a win and a loss. And if you're at 36 and your opponent is at 44 or 45, that's a loss, right?
I know. But when they said I lost, it was like I didn't exist. And you still had numerous people in the event.
But wasn't part of that that gave life to the Never Trump Movement?
Correct.
That night -.
No, no. The Never Trump Movement spent $12 million on that campaign. I spent zero. I spent almost nothing.
No. But I mean they came out of Wisconsin.
It gave them a glimmer of hope.
You did that in South Carolina after calling the last Republican president of the United States a liar.
Correct. Well, I didn't call him a liar. I didn't call him a liar. I did two things. Yeah, I did three things. Number one, the Pope came out against me. Because he that week and the Mexican leaders don't want the wall because that will stop them from continuing to rip us off and sending the wrong people and sending the drugs and sending whatever. They don't want a wall. So I had the Pope come out. In fact, I remember when Hope and Corey and a whole group came. "Could we see you?" "What happened?" "The Pope." I said, "The Pope? What has the Pope have to do with South Carolina?" "He just said some bad things about you." I said, "The Pope?" And the next day, it was a front page story.
So you knew what he had said before you responded?
Yeah, I did. And we put out a very strong statement.
But not exactly. It's not exactly what he had said.
No. I just knew that the Pope just came out. I said what is it?
Why hit him that hard? Why not just wait a little bit to see exactly -.
I didn't hit him.
Did anybody on your team say to you after that debate, Mr. Trump, you might have a problem in a state like this where the Bushes are popular, going that hard after President Bush?
More than one person, I can tell you that. Many, many people said -- there were people that said you just blew the state. I said I have to be honest. I have to be honest. And because it's a military state, a lot of soldiers, sailors, and I said I have to be honest. I have to be true to myself, OK? And you can't keep making statements that go unchallenged like Jeb was doing. By the way, when I said that, he went, huh. His response was so bad. So I made those statements. And as you know I won South Carolina going away.
And every delegate.
And every single delegate. Every single delegate.
No, I was not.
You have never seen so many candidates.
I had been to Jeb's. And I was going through O'Hare. I was at your Iowa rally that night, that day.
Right.
So I watched you at O'Hare -.
It wiped him off the papers. I mean it really -- you know I get a lot of this stuff. But you have never seen so many cameras. You were here?
No, I wasn't.
You couldn't get anybody in the building. There was so much press. It's a big building. So that was one of those things. But there were a lot of moments. I mean, I had a lot of -.
How did you come up with Low Energy Jeb?
I just came up with it. I just came up with it. I mean, we came up with some good ones.
OK.
I really enjoyed this.
Yeah. This has been very helpful. Thank you so much.
Thank you very much.
Yeah, I know who she is.
Well, I gave her a job that no other person would have given her because it was a long time ago and women were not in-charge of construction projects. But I took the chance and I put her in-charge of the job. I've got many emails from her thanking me and wanting a new job.
Before I get to Mr. O'Donnell, I may want to set the stage. This sort of serves a dual purpose, Mr. Trump, and that is for the book and for a story that would be in the very near future for this paper, and that is setting the stage to how this came to be, that Mr. O'Donnell, he became president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino. But before that, now that I've spent several months along with Marc researching your life, reading a lot of what's been written about it, it seems to me one of the most important moments is that moment when you learned that three of your top executives had died in a helicopter crash.
Absolutely right.
Where was that press conference, Mr. Trump?
I believe it was at The Plaza Hotel.
The one in New York?
Yeah. And they came up and they were going back. And they were just amazing, just amazing.
Did they meet with you also at Trump Tower or did you see them off at -.
They came over at Trump Tower. And I don't want to go into it, about me potentially being on that helicopter because people are going to say -- so I don't really want to get into it. But it was just one of those things.
I just want to accurately reconstruct it in the book because it is one of those dramatic narratives where -- I can't think of another other than your brother dying. It seems like one of the more dramatic emotional impacts.
It was dramatic not only from a financial standpoint because from a financial standpoint, it wasn't that. They were three guys that I really liked a lot. I built that whole thing and Steve was doing a phenomenal job with it. They're just, in my business. My business is so intense, you really become friends with the people that are involved. It was doing really, really well, and they died. It was a terrible situation.
As I understand it, and I talked with one of your associates, you were in your -- first of all, just to be clear, I may have spoken over what you mentioned. You saw them you all come back to the Trump Tower?
I came back and then they came back later.
They came back later and then they got -.
I'll never forget. I'll give you -- so what happened, I mean it's been a long time, but what happened -.because I might not have even gotten into that detail in the book. But they called for a helicopter. They go back to Atlantic City and they sent a helicopter, but it was a helicopter without a good record. They didn't like it and they called to get one that they liked better. It was an Agusta which was, you know, I won't fly in an Agusta. I will not fly in an Agusta helicopter because of the way they treated the families and everything else. But anyway, so they had a helicopter. It didn't have the greatest record. So rather than going, they waited for another helicopter which was sent. This was from a company. It wasn't my helicopter, it was from a company. So they waited for another helicopter. It actually delayed them. They got on the Agusta and that one went down.
How did you learn about that? Norma came in and told you?
Well, I was actually called by the state troopers of New Jersey because it went down right next to the directly through Norma. You know what I mean. Called -.
Through Norma, yeah.
But I got on the phone and said we have five people, meaning the pilots who I didn't know because it was a rental company. But two pilots and the three people, the three executives. So it was a terrible thing.
Do you still think about that day often?
I knew Steve's wife and I knew Mark's wife who were terrific women, and it was just a terrible situation. So what am I going to do?
Did they learn from you that their husbands had perished or were they told by somebody else first?
I called them.
That was the first they knew?
That was the first.
That must have been very difficult for you.
Difficult? Yeah, difficult. I never did a thing like that before. Now I know how the people go and when they inform the soldiers' families that they're gone. It's a very tough thing to do. I mean, the response was like horrible.
As long as we can finish up, that's no problem at all.
Just briefly, it was a very traumatic experience. They were great, great people. Can you imagine though they had one helicopter and they sent it away? I mean just bad stuff. Amazingly, they didn't make it down there, and that was a terrible thing. And calling their wives, I want to tell you that's not a call you want to make often because they had great relationships, both of them. The third was not married but getting married, going to get married in four or five months, Benanav. He was a great young guy. He was younger than the other two. A great young guy. Anyway, only because he was the only one standing, I put Jack O'Donnell there. He was a third-rate executive. He didn't do a good job. Nobody liked him, and ultimately I got rid of him. Then he wrote a book and he was nasty in the book. It's be good, people told me. But in all fairness, I had my upper management wiped out. I put him there and he was a third-rate executive. Nobody respected him. They didn't like him. I didn't. By the way, I dealt with him very little, just so you understand. I mean I dealt with him very, very little. I didn't know him well. I could barely tell you what he looked like. But he turned out to be a third-rate executive. He didn't do well. The sad part is I was comparing him against Steve Hyde who was a great executive, like day and night. Like day and night, and so I got rid of him. So he writes a book and he said negative things about me in the book. What am I going to do?
In the book, he doesn't describe it as being fired. He describes it as him quitting.
No, he didn't quit. I fired him. Why would he quit? I fired him. Now I will tell you something. He wasn't surprised. He knew he couldn't have done the position. He didn't have the ability to do the position, but I really had no choice because I didn't want to go out. He was there. It was a traumatic experience for Atlantic City, beyond me. It was a very traumatic experience for Atlantic City. It was very tough on the employees. I thought it would be better because in sometimes it doesn't work out. It didn't work out. But he turned out to be a third-rate executive.
So he was already the president of the -.when this happened, when the helicopter crash happened, he was at that time the president of The Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino. So you'd already given him a top position even before the crash.
He was just a cog. The people that ran it were Steve Hyde, Mark Etess, the group. They were the ones. And perhaps he was OK when they were over him. But when he became the boss, he was terrible.
Have you read his book?
No, I have not.
You have not. So I saw -.
I heard it was nasty, but I don't like to read nasty books about me, especially by disgruntled employees.
I think he would acknowledge that he's disgruntled because he has some very critical things to say. So by the definition of disgruntled, you know -.
He's a disgruntled former employee. I put him there only because it was the convenient thing to do. He did a lousy job. I didn't like him personally and I didn't like him as an executive. I didn't know him well. I made a lot of money in Atlantic City. It was a good experience. As you know, But he was not -- he was put there and I don't feel -- in a sense it was under the circumstances with the three people that were lost, these three great people. It turned out to be something that if I have to do it again, I wouldn't have. But I don't like having people where you put them in a position, you give them a shot at something, he didn't do well, and then he writes a book. So he takes my money and then he writes a book. When you take somebody's money, you don't write books about it.
Mr. Trump, I got a lot of questions so forgive me if I'm interrupting you. But was he the reason that you instituted your nondisclosure policy?
I think he actually -- I have to check. But I think he actually had. I can check it. No, it wasn't.
He was not covered under a nondisclosure. He believes that he was the reason you started that policy. Is that correct?
I believe he may have signed one. In fact, we're looking to see if he signed one.
Yeah. But what I'm asking you is after that experience -.
The book was a total failure. Frankly, the Washington Post is much more important to me than the book. That's why I'm talking to you right now.
Well, I appreciate that. The reason he is something that we're obviously going to write about is that there's only a very small number of your former top aides who have come out that critically. He wrote a whole book about it. There's just not other than maybe a couple of other examples, that's pretty unusual.
He got fired. He did a poor job. He's a disgruntled employee. I had Barbara Res. If you look at the emails -- maybe I'll send them to you anyway. I will.
I understand about Barbara Res. One of my reporter colleagues has interviewed Barbara Res separately.
OK, I'm going to send them. You give them to him. Hey, Meredith, pick up on 1 please. I want you to give them. Would you give it to the one that's dealing with Barbara Ross. It's the same kind of a thing.
OK. Your last name, Michael?
When your other reporter...
K r a n as in nickel, I, s as Sam, h. So it's michael.kranish@washpost.com. Meredith: OK.
Send that.
Let me ask you my -- before you go I need to make -.
A lot of people that worked at the place didn't like him either.
Let me ask you my quickest questions that I can so you don't leave without my asking them. In the book and in an interview, he says that your lawyer, Joseph Fusco, came to him and basically says Donald Trump doesn't want this book writtene.
I told you, I think Jack is a lightweight. I call him the lightweight. I think this lightweight has a nondisclosure, too, by the way. If we find it, great. If we don't find it, good. How many years ago are we talking about?
Just in fairness, I mean in the book, that's the reason a biography is done is that it's the full story. In today's Post, for example, there's a story by three reporters about how your business has done well since you've declared your candidacy.
Do you have the story in today? I haven't seen it.
That's in today's paper. Check it out. There's a story about how because of your personal financial disclosure form -.
I've been doing well for many years. I mean, you don't know, but that's OK.
Well, but the point of the story is that. Let me get over this guy. Let me just give you a final statement because I do have to run a company and a campaign. question, but go ahead if you'll just let me ask one other -.
I'm ambidextrous. I'm running a company and I'm running a campaign. I'm giving more and more of the company over to the executives to run and my kids. But I still am doing both, so I can't talk. I don't like to talk about guys that you hardly know. He's a total lightweight, this guy.
But in fairness, you did say in Playboy Magazine that most of what he wrote is, quote, probably true, unquote. Your words. So now you're saying -.
What did I say? Wait, wait. Most of what?
You said in a Playboy interview in 1997 that most of what he wrote is, quote, probably true, unquote. Those are your words.
I didn't read his book. I mean I don't know what I'm referring to. Well, I've said it -D oh, I see, I've said it sarcastically. That is true. I probably said something sarcastic. It was probably true. I said who cares. I said who cares what he wrote in the book.
One of the questions. He did show me a letter that was written on Trump Castle stationary which basically said, OWatch your back. Donald is coming after you. He's concerned that you have a photo of Donald and Marla that handwritten -.
I'm sure he made that letter up himself for you to see. I couldn't have cared less. I couldn't have cared less. I'm sure he made it up himself. This is a bad guy. He'll accept your check. When he loses, he tries to make money with a book. By the way, his book was a total failure.
Right. I hear what you're saying. But if you haven't read it, that doesn't mean you know whether it's full of accuracies or not.
The thing in the Washington Post, I said -.I mean to the Playboy, I said, who cares? It's probably true. Who cares? I never saw the book. I don't think I've ever even seen the book, but I heard it was a negative book with a negative point that failed.
And you said in that interview you had only met him two or three times. He told me he's met with you hundreds of times, which is close to -.
Oh, no. I didn't know him. I knew him as an executive. I didn't know him. And ultimately I fired him.
Right, I know you do.
And I literally mean it. Hope Hicks can't even talk to people because they're calling her every five minutes. I'm talking to you for a long time -.
I appreciate it.
-- a bout a guy who I fired many years ago because he didn't do a good job. I have nothing against him. I don't care about him. I didn't know him well. But I fired him because he didn't do a good job. He wrote a phony book and you're putting it in. He's a disgruntled employee and I can understand him being disgruntled. That's OK. But the because it was a failed book and it's all a pack of lies, and so it's one of those things. Now, you're asking me now to take more time to call all these people so they can speak to you. You're going to have to write what you write, OK? And then when you write it, I'll say you're full of shit. But write what you have to write. I could track down Joe Fusco, I guess. I don't know where he works now. I really don't. But I think he's a high quality, wonderful guy. I don't want to waste the time.
OK. I'm just trying to follow up. And Hope Hicks said I should ask, at least try. She's not part of this conversation, but -.
At least I'm giving you a story. I mean, you can believe it, but you don't have to believe it. He was third-rate and I get rid of him. Period.
All right. I look forward to talking to you about other topics. I understand that you've got to run and I look forward to hopefully talking to you.
I think you understand. I've devoted a lot of time. I hate to devote a lot of time to a guy like that because the guy is -- I mean he's a pure stone cold loser. OK, you take care. Let me know about your next topic. Make it a more pleasant one please.
OK. Thank you, Mr. Trump.
Thank you very much.
You have been up early this morning.
I always get up early.
You get up early. You're tweeting early, Donald.
I get up early. I get up nice and early.
Why are you tweeting early, Donald?
Because I like tweeting. Because I like getting the word out.
Yeah. What word do you want to get out this morning?
Well, I think I have gotten the word out. You know, Hillary said some things and I said some things and now I go and I go back to work and I have a lot of fun.
What's the worst example of her, you say she has horrible judgment.
Well, I could tell you a lot of examples, but one of them is Libya. Libya was an example. Libya is a disaster and by the way, just in case you have any questions, right now ISIS has taken the oil from Libya. So we knock out Libya and you knock out Gadhafi and she thinks we did a great job. And it's just more destabilization, a total disaster -- and ISIS has the oil.
Would you have stayed out of Libya?
I would have stayed out of Libya. Yeah. I would have stayed our of Iraq too.
So there are a lot of people that say you have inconsistent foreign policy, but it sounds pretty consistent here -- you're -- as far as what you've just said this morning, you wouldn't have gone into Libya.
Right.
You've said you wouldn't go into Iraq. You say you wouldn't go into Syria. You wouldn't have fought Assad.
But I would go after ISIS -- big league.
But you would go after ISIS...
Right.
Even if...
And, Joe, ISIS is fighting -- ISIS is fighting Syria. So you have some people -- most people -- they want to fight Syria and they want to fight ISIS at the same time and they are fighting each other.
Right. So what you're saying is Assad can stay in power, that's not your interest. Your interest is...
No, what I'm saying is we have bigger problems than Assad.
Yeah -- yeah -- what your interest is, though, militarily you tell the generals, go after ISIS, but we're not interested in replacing Assad.
I would say knock the hell out of ISIS, which we could have done originally. Knock the hell -- look, we shouldn't have been in Iraq. Bad decision. Then the way Obama got us out was a horrible decision, the way we came out. And I would have said -- and by the way, ISIS was created because of that. Because they wouldn't take them in. Because we had the wrong leadership. We put the wrong leadership on Iraq.
All right. One more foreign policy question. You know, people like myself have criticize Barack Obama, Republicans have for eight years, for not being good friends with our friends, but leaning over backwards to help our enemies, whether it's Iran or Cuba. This past week a lot of people confused because you're talking about -- sounding like Obama saying you would go to North Korea, you'd talk to the North Koreans. At the same time...
I wouldn't go to North Korea, Joe. I wouldn't go there.
Or you would talk -- you would talk to them.
The last thing I do is go -- I would never go to North Korea. I don't know who would say I would go there.
OK, you won't go there. You'll talk to the North Korean leader.
Yes, I would.
Maybe he could go to your resort in Scotland and you all can talk there. But anyway, you talk to him, but then on the other side of it, you're attacking Great Britain, our longest running ally. Is there an inconsistency there?
I'm not attacking Great Britain. Where am I attacking Great Britain? I'm not attacking them at all. They asked me about the EU. I said, frankly, it's none of my business. And I don't even like asking it -- answering it, but, frankly, if I were Great Britain, I'd get out of the EU. I see what happened with the great migration destroying Europe and EU had a lot to do with that. Personally, I would get out but I said I don't want that to influence the people of Great Britain.
Right. You -- you were going after David Cameron, though, their leader.
I don't go after -- you show me where. He came after me a little bit. And by the way, he would like me now to visit 10 Downing Street. They put out that invitation about two days ago. So I will do just fine with David Cameron. I think he's a nice guy. I will do just fine. But they have asked me to visit 10 Downing Street -- and I might do it.
So, you don't have a problem with the troops staying there. You just want Japan and South Korea to pay us for their presence.
I want them to pay up.
Fair enough.
Because we are not a country -- this isn't 40 years ago and 20 years ago.
Right.
We are not a country that can afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Germany, the NATO nations, 28 NATO nations, many of which are not paying us and they're not living up to their agreement.
No.
Japan, South Korea, nobody, we're like the dummies that protect everybody. All I'm saying is, we have to get reimbursed because we can't afford it.
OK, but Donald...
And nobody says that. And Bob Gates, who I don't know at all, but Bob Gates has no idea. See, they're misrepresenting it, he's misrepresenting it.
So Bob Gates is one of the greatest foreign policy minds in history. And I think the worry...
Oh, really, why? Because we're doing so well? You mean, you think we're doing well with his foreign policy, Mika?
Donald -- I think -- I think the worry also is just how you will be as president and present your positions and your words, and there are some concerns that you might be trigger-happy with your words. Like, for example...
Oh, really?
Yes.
I'm the one that didn't want to go into Iraq, Mika.
I'm -- even talking about for example the tweet that you sent out yesterday morning.
What's wrong with them?
I will tell you that some might say.
Go ahead.
That it was very much generating hatred, focusing on the hatred and fear that terrorism brings to the American people. And maybe perhaps that first tweet...
Well, you feel that way, but I -- I said another plane was blown up and I can practically guarantee who blew it up. And another plane went down...
But listen -- listen -- Donald listen to yourself right now.
And let me tell you, the -- the mind set of a weak Hillary Clinton, which is four more years of Obama is not going to do it for our country, Mika.
Right.
And I said, when you find out what happened to the plane, it will be exactly what I said. That plane didn't go down because of mechanical failure.
Nice, headed into a good segue. Hey Donald, it's Willie.
Hi Willie.
Good to talk to you this morning. I want to ask you about something you said last night at Chris Christie's fund-raiser, which is quote, "Who the hell cares if there's a trade war. You have been open about a 35 percent tariff on exports from China and from Mexico. Most experts believe that would plunge China and Mexico into a recession.
Oh really?
Could perhaps put the United States into a recession.
Oh you think so? I don't think so.
Are you concerned about the jobs that will be lost in this country because of a trade war?
OK. No. OK. Ready? So, China, we have a trade deficit with China of $505 billion this year.
Donald.
They are absolutely making it impossible for our companies to compete with China. And by doing that, it's taking our jobs away. I mean, look at our country. Look at the jobs -- the real job situation, not the phony job, with the 5 percent stuff. Lock at the real job situation. If I go out and I see communities that have been stripped of their jobs.
Donald, do you believe though, if you put that tariff on Chinese exports it would put the Chinese economy into a recession?
No I don't.
Yes.
I don't care.
We heard you.
I'm just telling you. I don't like that. But more importantly...
Donald...
... I don't like where our country is and he's been there for many years.
Yes.
Well, I think things are very bad now.
Donald, you're like my dad, right?
And I think they're very bad world-wide. I think the world is a mess.
Yes, I just want a -- I want a quick button on this, because that was an important thing you just said and very interesting. That the 35 percent tariff you proposed may just be a negotiating tool and you may not ever implement it.
Well, I hate to say that, because I hate to tell China there that. But you know what? I will tell China right now. I will implement it if they don't behave and they are not behaving. They are devaluing their currency. Recently, nine months ago, they gave the biggest devaluation in the history -- the biggest in 20 years, in two decades. And, they are not behaving. They are not playing fair.
All right. So, Donald...
And on top of that, they are building a major fortress in the South China Sea, which they're not supposed to be doing.
All right. So, I'm just going to say it for everybody. So, just so China knows, Donald is going to put on like an 80 percent tariff. He's going to...
Don't joke, Joe. I mean, you're having -- hey Joe. You're having a lot of fun.
Hold on! Hold -- Donald, let me finish! Let me finish Donald! You have got to let me finish.
OK. Don't joke Joe.
Yes, they are.
... and really unifying. And people are endorsing me now...
Yes, they are.
... that frankly, I was a little bit surprised to see some of the people that are endorsing me.
It's also sir. With all due respect, it's close.
I actually do. Joe knows that and Mika knows that. But, he is second, I will say that. He's above any other Republican.
He is.
But, I will say this. We have one thing very strongly in common. We know that the United States is being taken advantage horribly on trade deals. The difference between Bernie and myself is that I know how to make those trade deals fantastic and he doesn't. He has no clue.
Donald Trump, thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks, Donald.
Thank you very much.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Mr. Trump, yesterday Hillary said over on another channel, she said your proposal to ban Muslims promotes terrorism.
Yeah. Is that the dumbest thing you have ever heard? I mean, to me it's one of the dumber statements I ever heard. I mean, she's so ill-equipped to be the president of the country.
Well, Donald Trump...
Nobody turned him in.
One of the neighbors had watched things going on in San Bernardino, but didn't want to turn him in, because didn't want to be labeled a racist or a bigot.
That's right. They didn't want to do it because they thought it would be politically incorrect.
Right.
You know what? That is a lawyer, Steve, that goes and says, oh, we've got to do something because you're going to be in trouble. You knew all about this, so they said let's not be politically incorrect.
Yeah.
The whole thing is so insane. So we're going to have to get very tough and very smart. And Hillary Clinton can never get you there. It's four more years of Obama, and this country can't take it.
She call -- yeah, she calls it the gold standard, but she now say says has problems with it.
Well, no, she wanted it so badly. And now she sees that I'm against it, and so she went and studied it. And now she says, oh, maybe he's right. So, maybe now she's going against it.
Right.
But that was only because of me. Because it would be -- by the way, Brian, it will be a disaster.
One of the interesting things, she wants to put her husband in charge of the economy. First of all, the president should be in charge of the economy.
Right. He should run.
He -- he also pushed the sub-prime mortgages to people that couldn't afford it. And experienced the boom which bust under Bush.
That's right. And by the way, he was then -- and Brian, he was then out of office. So, you know, everyone said, oh, gee, he's out of office, but he was the one that got that started, and that led to catastrophe.
Right. Don't you -- don't you think he -- she is saying I'm going to put him in charge of that, because people like him more than they like her?
Well, maybe she's saying that, or maybe she just wants him around the White House, so she can keep her eye on him.
Yeah.
Look, I am who I am. We're going to make great trade deals, we're going to have strong borders, we're going to build up our military. We're going to terminate Obamacare and get great health care.
Right.
And you know, we'll do a lot of things and I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't change too much.
Who -- by the way, who else is on that short list?
Well, I'd like to tell you, but you know what? Newt is a -- such a great guy. He has been such a great supporter. And he actually said, you know, he's a fantastic historian. I don't know if you know that.
But he's on the short list, right?
Absolutely.
What about -- how many -- right. How many women are on that list?
Well, I don't want to say. Look, I'm going to make the announcement during the convention. I hope to be able to keep it a surprise. And...
All right. We'll be covering it. We'll be there.
I think you will. I have a feeling you will be there. I'm not sure.
We'll be there. We're going to both conventions.
I'm not sure.
We know who is going to be in July, that's for sure. All right, thank you so much.
I have a feeling you folks are going to be there.
All right.
OK, thank you.
Great, to hear from you.
Thank you.
Now for the top story. Interview with Donald Trump. The candidate joins us now from his New York City headquarters. First of all, you still believe that Egyptian Airliner was blown out of the sky? There is a lot of different speculation now.
I do. In a certain way. I mean, I don't know what they used but something bad happened and we'll see. I guess they will eventually find out but I certainly do. I know that plane very well. I know that type of aircraft. And you have thousands and thousands flying millions of miles and never been anything like it. So I do and I think most people do.
OK. Now, would you support asking Congress for a declaration of war? To fight terrorism and then under that declaration it would be the groups that would be -- that the United States would declare war on, ISIS, al Qaeda, Taliban. Would you favor that because if your president, a declaration of war gives you more power to defeat these people?
It wouldn't bother me at all doing that. We probably should have done that in the first place. Look, we are at war with these people and they don't wear uniforms. It's not your traditional war where it's a war against Germany, Japan, or whoever. This is a war against people that are vicious, violent people, that we have no idea who they are, where they come from. We are allowing tens of thousands of them into our country now. So on top of wars on foreign land, wait until you see what happens in the future. It's probably not going to be pretty. I hope I'm wrong about that but it's probably not going to be pretty.
All right. But it's speculation.
And we're allowing, Bill, we're allowing, well, that's not speculation. We are allowing people into our country we don't know who they are, where they come from. Some of them happen to have cellphones with the ISIS flag on them. So, I think it's something that we have to be very tough and very vigilant and very smart or we will be in big trouble.
OK. You've done very well with your national security policy. But I want to get you "ON THE RECORD." Would you ask Congress to pass a declaration of war if you are elected?
I would have no problem with doing it, Bill.
OK. But that doesn't mean you would do it but I will take that.
No. I will study the facts.
OK.
I will study the facts. But I would have, I think right now I would have no problem with doing it because we are at war.
All right. Because it does give the President --
By the way, the world is at war.
-- more powerful in waging the fight. Now, you and I have gone around and around on ISIS a bit.
That's correct.
And your theory is that you take their oil away, you strangle their ability to finance themselves and that's one of the components. I say that if you do that --
I have said that for a long time.
Right. I say if you do that, it's going to be a blood bath. They are not going to get that oil up easy. So, you're going to have to have ground troops to do it. It's going to be a blood bath. How about this? Would you support declaring that anyone buying oil from ISIS is an enemy of the state? That means an enemy of the United States? That way anybody who buys it, we can drop a drone on.
Well, you know, it depends who it is and everything else. I'm not sure I want to go that far because you could have -- maybe they send two barrels to England. Maybe they send two barrels to Sweden.
No, no, no, you know --
I don't know.
You know, the buyers, the guy, not the secondary market. The first guys who buy it.
Yes.
See, I would do that. I would say enemies of the state you can buy from ISIS and I'm going to come get you. That would dry up the -- their oil. That would put them out of the oil business as they say in Texas.
I can tell you right now. We're not even hitting the people that are buying it on site, the trucks and the --
No. No not at all. In fact they say, don't hit them that we have transmissions of the military saying, don't hit them. Blow the hell out of them. But you'd had to declare them enemies of these states. So, you'd have to do that first.
By the way, in that case, in that case, absolutely 100 percent. Because we're not hitting them. In fact, we are saying get out of your trucks. We're going to go after you. The whole thing is so preposterous what we're doing.
I would vaporize the trucks.
Those people I would hit so hard so fast and so fast.
OK.
Absolutely.
Let's turn to domestic issue that's getting a lot of people angry. Right after you, we're going to have a talk with Kirsten Powers about transgendered orders from the White House, which would basically put people who are transitioning from one sex to another but haven't done it biologically yet, in a locker room so you would have little girls, you know, eight, you know, to 11 or 12 with a boy who wants to be a girl in the same shower conceivably. That could happen. And in Charlotte observer, editorialized recently that that's fine, we need to get over that. I was a little perturbed by that editorial. What say you?
Well, it's not fine. And I have to tell you that I would generally speaking leave it to the states to decide. You know, Obama is getting into a very tricky territory. And that amazing thing is so many people are talking about this now and we have to protect everybody, even if it's one personal. But this is such a tiny part of our population. Now, with that being said, protect everybody, but I would really leave it up to the states in this case.
Do you have -- in your facilities, your hotels, do you have separate facilities for transgendered? Are you going to put those in?
No, we don't. No, we don't have that.
Are you going to put them in?
I hope not because, frankly, it would be unbelievably expensive nationwide. It would be, you know --
But it's human rights -- it's human rights.
Hundreds of billions of dollars. It would be -- well, I don't know about human rights. I can tell you that it would be unbelievably expensive thing to do. And I think our country really wants to be spending money in other things in terms of let's build more buildings, let's create more jobs or something. But that would be unbelievably expensive situation to do. Unbelievably. And, frankly, the number of people we're talking about is really a small number.
Yes.
Again, protect them but it's a very, very small number.
OK. I think it was today on the internet you put up some stuff about Hillary Clinton and Bill Clintons. Kind of tawdry stuff. And I'm not sure that this is a good thing to do that.
Are you talking about what I'm doing? Well, I'm only responding to what they do. They have been -- she has been very nasty and I said I would like it to be on policy, Bill. I would like it to be a straight right down the middle and by the way the one thing you didn't mention about the polls, number one, I think I am popular with people. I really do. And I think a lot of people that maybe say I'm not, they are going to still vote for me. But you didn't explain that I was winning in most of the polls now, I'm winning into tracking polls and I'm winning in most of the polls against Hillary.
No. Everybody watches every night.
Some people might not have seen that.
No. They all saw it.
OK.
Every human being on earth knows and saw that because it goes on the internet.
OK.
And you tweeted about it and everybody reads your tweets. So that's been out. But I understand what you are trying to do here is inhibit Mrs. Clinton from attacking you personally by saying if you play that game, then can I come back 10 times harder. I understand that. But it is -- you know that it makes the country look bad abroad and things like that. That's what worries me. I mean, I understand the Clinton attack machine. I got it. And I think it has to be dealt with someone. But I think maybe caution.
Bill, I don't like doing that. I don't like doing that. But I have no choice. When she hits me on things, I just have no choice. So, you have to do it. It's unfair. And you know they are dirty players. They have been dirty players. Historically. And I have to fight back the way I have to fight back.
All right. And voters will make up their mind. As I said, if it's in context everybody I think will understand it, but I hope you guys both just -- you are right, I mean, it should be issues, right? You and her, on the issues?
I would rather have policy and issues. Much rather have policy and issues. Absolutely.
And you come on this show and you come on other shows that are not as prestigious as this. We understand why you come here. You are a standup guy. But she doesn't do that. And I think she should, I think she should answer the same kind of questions you answer, you know?
Well, she doesn't. And she goes on very few shows and I notice the other night she was on a show and they gave her setup questions and they negotiate their questions. And I don't think you can ever say that I negotiate my questions with you.
Do you think that would work by the way -- do you think that would work if you came to my people and said I want O'Reilly to ask me these questions? Do you think that would work?
Yes. I actually told my people don't waste your time it's not going to happen. But I will say this. I will say, if you look at her questions, they are negotiated questions.
Yes.
And I'm not saying that's a dumb thing to do, Bill. I'm not saying it's so bad if she can get away with it.
He can't get away with it.
But I believe, whatever it is.
Is this what it's going to be like covering you if you're president?
Yes, it is.
This is not an isolated incident. I mean, you went through...
No. No.
... The New York Times front page story, printed almost 20 pages about all these women you had supposedly mistreated. It turns out in every case, it was debunked by the women themselves, and even the one woman that stood by your side...
They went public. Sean, they went public.
Yes. What is your -- look, I know you've been having these discussions with Paul Ryan. What is the status of those? And what is your reaction with the exception of Bob Dole, former presidential candidates and others, saying they're not coming to the convention? That seems to me...
Well, Bob Dole...
Incredible.
... corrupt.
I mean, honestly, I mean, you take away those superdelegates, Bernie Sanders would have had a shot to win a long time ago but it creates a perception...
Yes.
Yes.
So I guess she won a few up front, but she is losing so badly. It looks so bad. Now, let's see what happens in California, but she is not doing well.
I am not the corrupt press. I am -- I'm actually the conservative here.
That's true, by the way. You happen to be right about that.
Yes, well, I'm an opinion show. And I don't hold back that I'll be voting for Donald Trump in November. All right, here's what I think is an important question.
Thank you.
You saw the inspector general report as it relates to the Hillary Clinton email scandal. She's got a lot of other issues that I think make her a weak candidate. To the extent that it's a battle between you and her in a general election, how hard do you think you have to push in terms of getting that story out if you think the media's corrupt and liberal and they've got an agenda?
Well, I think the report is a disaster. It really shows that she's corrupt, if you think of it. I mean, it's not just the report. It shows that she's corrupt. I think the report is a disaster. I don't know what's going to happen. You would have thought it would have happened by now. The FBI is doing a big investigation. We'll see. But the report, I think, is a total disaster for her, and certainly it's going to be a big part of the campaign.
Yes. All right, Mr. Trump. Always good to have you. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.
Thank you.
OK.
Sound bites...
You're very successful.
Oh, it has a lot to do. You can't...
I want to ask you about comments you made about the judge...
Sure.
-- in the Trump University case.
Sure.
Hillary Clinton said that that is a racist attack on a federal judge.
Oh, you know, she's so wonderful. You know, I mean here's a woman that should be put in jail for what she did with her emails and she's commenting on this.
Right.
OK. I have a situation where the woman that brought the case brought the case. She's the plaintiff. She was deposed. She was found to be a disaster for them as a witness, because she gave an evaluation that was like the best evaluation you've even heard -- wait just one second.
But what --
Let me tell you...
So no Mexican judge could ever be involved in a case...
Well?
-- that involves you?
No, he's a member of a society where, you know, very pro- Mexico and that's fine. It's all fine. But I think...
Except that you're calling into question...
-- I think he should...
But I'm not talking about that.
Well, no, that's another...
I'm talking about the...
-- that's another problem.
But he's American. He's an American.
-- the Mexican -- he's of Mexican heritage and he's very proud of it, as I am where I come from, my parents.
But he's an American. You keep talking about...
Jake...
-- it's a conflict of interest...
-- Jake, Jake...
So you disagree with his rulings...
No, no.
-- I totally understand that.
No. Not me.
But you're sa...
I've had lawyers come up to me and say you are being treated so unfairly, it's unbelievable.
I don't really want to litigate the case...
You have to...
-- of Trump University...
-- because if he was...
What a...
-- was giving me fair rulings, I wouldn't say that.
My question is...
But, Jake...
Yes?
-- if you were giving me fair rulings, I wouldn't be talking to this way. He's giving me horrible rulings...
But I don't care if you criticize him. That's fine. You can criticize every decision. What I'm saying is if you invoke his race as a reason why he can't do his job...
I think that's why he's doing it. But...
When Hillary Clinton says it's a racist attack...
Hillary -- Hillary Clinton is a stiff. If Hillary Clinton becomes president...
But Paul Ryan today...
-- I mean...
-- Paul Ryan today said he -- he didn't care for the way that you were attacking this judge.
Look, I'm just telling you. Paul Ryan doesn't know the case. Here's the story.
I do. And we've reported it.
Oh, you do?
We've re- we've reported it on my show.
OK.
In fact.
OK, good. Well, I'm glad. You're the only one. The law firm...
Before either of you were president -- were running for president...
She wasn't working. Everybody fell asleep during the speech.
Yes.
Do you know they've contributed a lot of money to Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general?
Here is my question.
No, no, do you know that?
I did not know that.
Do you know that these people went to every attorney general, practically, in the country that they could and do you know this case was turned down by almost every attorney general, from Texas to Florida to many of these states?
Is it not, when Hillary Clinton says this is a racist attack and you reject that, if you are saying he can't do his job because of his race, is that not the definition of racism?
No, I don't think so at all.
No?
No. He's proud of his heritage. I -- I respect him for that.
But you're saying he can't do his job because of that.
Look, he's proud of his heritage, OK. I'm building a wall. Now, I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics.
-- he's not from Mexico.
In my opinion...
You're the nominee.
I told you.
Can I just say one point on that? I have looked so long and hard for any evidence of you...
I will give it to you. 2004, they had newspaper articles.
But didn't you -- didn't you say to Howard that you thought it was a good idea?
No, I -- this was before the war started, long before the war started.
Yes.
There was a lot of articles.
Yes, a year after the war started.
No, no, but I was against it from before it started.
The only thing I would say, and then we don't have to belabor this point, is, if there is evidence of you being against the war strongly before the war actually started, I would love to see that.
OK, but I think there is evidence.
I just haven't seen that.
I think there is evidence.
2004, no question.
OK?
Well, let me just read from you.
A hundred percent.
It's about 50 percent.
It's actually less than 50 percent. But a general got on and said 50 percent recently. But, even if it was 50 percent, why aren't they paying us 100 percent?
These are U.S. allies, I mean, major U.S. allies.
Excuse me.
Yes.
It's got to work two ways.
I want to get your response to some violence we've seen outside events of yours, violence committed by people opposed to you.
By thugs.
What is your message?
By thugs.
What is your message?
The people that burn our American flag, they're thugs.
What is your message to these people committing these acts of violence?
I would be very strong if I were the police. I think Sheriff Joe Arpaio would not have let a thing like that happen, I will tell you, because we had a potential of some violence. He walked in there, and they just split up like you have never seen.
Do you have evidence of that?
Well, they have the Bernie signs. They got a lot of Bernie signs.
So they're Bernie supporters?
Well, they have got the Bernie signs. And they're the Bernie signs, the same people -- the same signs that they use at their rallies.
I want to ask you about comments you made about the judge in the Trump University case.
Sure. Sure.
You said that you thought it was a conflict of interest that he was the judge because he's of Mexican heritage, even though he's from Indiana.
OK. Yes. Yes.
Hillary Clinton said that that is a racist attack on a federal judge.
Oh, she's so wonderful. You know, I mean, here's a woman that should be put in jail for what she did with her emails, and she's commenting on this.
Except that you're calling into question his heritage.
I think he should recuse himself.
... whether or not he can do his job.
Jake, I'm building a wall, OK? I'm building a wall. I am trying to keep business out of Mexico. Mexico's fine. There's nothing...
But he's American. He's an American.
He's of Mexican heritage. And he's very proud of it, as I am of where I come from, my parents.
So, you disagree with his rulings.
No, no, no.
I totally understand that. But you're...
Not me. I have had lawyers come up to me, say, you are being treated so unfairly, it's unbelievable.
Isn't...
You know that plaintiffs in the case have all said wonderful things about the school, and they're suing? You know why they're suing? Because they want to get their money back.
The question is...
Jake, if he were giving me fair rulings, I wouldn't be talking to you this way. He's given me horrible rulings.
I do. And we've reported it.
Oh, you do? Oh.
We've reported it on my show, in fact.
OK, good. Well, I'm glad. You're the only one.
The only ones...
The law firm -- wait a minute. The law firm paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to Hillary Clinton for speeches.
Before either of you were president -- were running for president.
She wasn't worth it. Everybody fell asleep during the speech, OK?
Yes.
Do you know that they contributed a lot of money to Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general?
Here's my question.
No, no. Do you know that?
I did not know that.
Do you know that these people went to every attorney general, practically, in the country that they could, and do you know this case was turned down by almost every attorney general, from Texas to Florida to many of these states?
Is it not -- when Hillary Clinton says, this is a racist attack -- and you reject that -- if you are saying he can't do his job because of his race, is that not the definition of racism?
No, I don't think so at all.
No?
No. He's proud of his heritage. I -- I respect him for that.
But you're saying he can't do his job because of that.
Look, he's proud of his heritage. OK? I'm building a wall. Now, I think I'm going to do very well with Hispanics.
But he's not -- he's not from Mexico. He's from Indiana.
In my opinion -- he is -- his Mexican -- Mexican heritage. And he's very proud of it.
But you're not from Scotland because you have Scottish heritage.
Excuse me. Hey, you know what? I'm not building a wall between Scotland and the United States.
Mr. Trump, thanks so much for your time. I always appreciate you taking my questions.
Thank you very much. Thank you, Jake.
Let me ask you about Libya. You have been highly critical of Libya and Hillary Clinton. You were also for military action to oust Gadhafi and military action to take care of the humanitarian situation in Libya. You supported that.
When you say supported it, I supported Libya?
Yes, you supported the intervention in Libya.
I did? Where do you see that?
But you said you were never for intervention.
I was never for a strong intervention. I could have seen surgical, where you take out Gadhafi and his group.
But it sounds like you were making promise for your attorney general that, if you were elected, this is one of the things -- this is a commitment you were making.
That's true, yes.
It's a commitment to have your attorney general...
Certainly have my -- very fair, but I would have my attorney general look at it.
But what do you get -- what gets them to jail, though? This is -- what's the difference here between rhetoric and law?
What the lawyers are saying is what she did in terms of national security, we have very strict rules and regulations -- she's broken all of them.
For instance?
But Paul -- Paul Ryan -- well, I think we will agree on -- as an example, he really focuses on poverty. He wants to take people out of poverty. So do I. And we're going to come up with a plan.
Do you see yourself as implementing Paul Ryan's agenda as president, or is Paul Ryan implementing the Donald Trump agenda?
I think it's going to be a compromise, honestly. I can see a compromise.
My question is, if it were a Muslim judge, would you also feel like they wouldn't be able to treat you fairly because of that policy of yours?
It's possible, yes. Yes. That would be possible, absolutely.
Isn't there sort of a tradition, though, in America that we don't judge people by who their parents were and where they came from?
I'm not talking about tradition. I'm talking about common sense. OK? He's somebody -- he is proud of his heritage. And I think that's great that he's proud of his heritage.
But you're saying it's a barrier to him doing his job.
He's not treating me fair. He's not treating me fairly.
Last question. Should the U.S. go to the Olympics still with the threat of Zika in Brazil?
The answer is, yes, but certainly, if an athlete wouldn't want to do it, they should the right not to do it, but I would say yes.
All right, Mr. Trump, thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
Sir. It's Bob O'Harrow and Shawn Boburg from The Washington Post. How are you?
Hey, I'm good. What's up?
Hey, thanks for squeezing us in. We're going to tape as usual. You may not remember,                but we spoke a couple of times about Roy Cohn for the Trump book and for the story                that we're doing. We have sketched in the story and we thought that if you had a                moment, we would just tell you about where the story goes and see if there's                anything else you wanted to add.
OK. Go ahead.
So I'm going to rip through this, but essentially, we took your lead and used the                time way back when, when we're all younger and where you met Roy Cohn at Le Club and                asked -according to one of your books -for advice about the Justice Department's                allegations against you and your father and that -.
Which, by the way, it was a lawsuit against many developers all over the city. You do                know that, right?
Yeah. There were others. LeFrak and others were sued as well. In this case, Roy,                according to your account, which we thought was charming, you didn't like settling,                and he said in effect, my view is to tell them to go to hell and fight the thing in                court. And after that, we talked about how Roy Cohn represented you in legal                battles. He had a hand in setting up the prenuptial agreement in your marriage and                advised you on various things. I guess you guys went out as well.
Oh, no. Roy was a lawyer. I mean he represented me as a lawyer. Why would you say go                out? He represented me as a lawyer and he was a very good lawyer. For me, he was a                good lawyer. For some people, they weren't as happy, but I was very happy with him.                He also represented a very good friend of mine, George Steinbrenner. It was George.                He represented the New York Yankees and George Steinbrenner. He represented Conde                Nast. Probably, his best friend was Si Newhouse. Si Newhouse of Conde Nast was one                of his best friends, but he represented many people, not just us.
We actually have you saying that in the story and also you pointed out that he was a                lawyer, that he wasn't a mentor or whatever. Here's what you told us before. In                interviews with The Post, Trump maintained Cohn was his attorney, stressing that he                was only one of many of Cohn's Cohn on his aggressive tactics and rhetoric saying,                quote, I don't think I got that from Roy at all. I think I have a natural instinct                for that. Now, you should know that part of the reason I wanted to share this was                that Roger Stone described Roy Cohn as being much more than a personal lawyer.                That's his words. And that he was kind of a cultural guide to Manhattan for you, as                he put it. And then also Wayne Barrett, who's spent a lot of time with both you and                Roy Cohn, here's what he wrote about you. I don't know if you've ever read his book,                but -.
I never read it because his book was total fiction, but I never read it. Believe me,                Wayne Barrett was just nonsense. Anything he wrote was nonsense. But anyway, go                ahead with Wayne Barrett.
Well, he described you as an adviser and as a mentor and just for what it's worth,                Barrett says that he can -- I 'll just read you this. He says Barrett now says                Cohn's stamp on Trump is obvious. Quote, I just look at him and see Roy -Barrett                said in an interview -both of them are attack dogs.
Yeah. Well, I don't see myself as an attack dog. I see myself as somebody that's made                a lot of money and see myself as an attack dog unless I'm attacked.
I understand.
But I don't see that.
So we go through -- go ahead, I'm sorry.
I get it, but Roy represented lots of people, but Roy was a tough guy. Anyway, so go                ahead.
We give the background of Roy Cohn, which as you know is fascinating to say the                least. His work in the U.S. Attorneys ' Office, his work in Washington on various                cases including as an aide to Joseph McCarthy, and his decision to come back to New                York and he established himself when you were just a little guy in New York. He                developed this network, which is pretty incredible looking back on, the people he                had in his parties.
That's true.
He had a direct relationship with J. Edgar Hoover.
He had amazing people at parties. That's true. He had really an amazing group of both                glamorous people, influential people. I have not seen anything like it since and                frankly, he really had amazing people, fellows at parties. In terms of interesting                parties, they were the most interesting. letters that he wrote to J. Edgar Hoover                and we looped back to when you guys met and his representation on that first case                and the $100 million dollar lawsuit.
We say this, that you signed a consent decree,                but that in effect you and your father declared victory because there was no legal                finding that you had discriminated as far as I can recall.
Unlike others where there was a finding. But many people were sued under that whole                situation.
In Barrett's book, there's this passage where it talks about you once gave him a                statement and said this. Trump once said that Cohn represented him in two libel                cases against journalists. Though Trump said the legal work cost $100,000, he said                it was worth the money because, quote, I've broken one writer, according to a                statement he once gave to reporter, Wayne Barrett. Do you remember that writer?
No. I don't remember the statement. You have to understand, anything Wayne Barrett                wrote was fiction. It was all made up from his mind. I'd say there were three to                four guys like that that I've met over my lifetime, but there are some writers that                anything they write is total fiction.
The statement was that before Wayne Barrett's original stories came out in the                Village Voice, you gave him a statement that said that Roy Cohn had represented you                in two libel cases and that you paid $100,000 for the legal work and that you,                quote, I've broken one writer. It was before the stories came out, so presumably it                was kind of a little bit of a reminder that you were willing to sue.
No, I never said that.
OK. You never said it or you don't recall it?
I certainly don't recall it and I don't think I ever said it.
We're going to add that to the story, Mr. Trump.
But, frankly, I'll go a step further. I don't know of any lawsuits that I sued. A                couple of times, I sued writers because they were dealing with fiction, which of                course many of them do, but I don't believe I ever said a thing like that to Wayne                Barrett. a little more about Roy Cohn and we do it because his influence does -- oh,                go ahead. I'm sorry.
Well, I just wanted to ask real quick. You do recall Roy representing you with regard                to the prenuptial agreement with Ivana?
Yes.
In any case, we talked about Roy Cohn's background as almost sort of it's kind of                like fiction except it's not. He was very open about his distaste for taxes in the                city and with the IRS. He talked in his book -he wrote a book called How to Stand Up                for Your Rights and Win about -.
He won the case for me, you know, the Trump Tower tax case. You know that.
What's that?
The Trump Tower, the tax case.
Got it. We talked a little bit about the Studio 54 days and his representation of                those guys and the club itself. We talked a little bit -just FYI -about going to a                quote we took from TrumpNation about just those days and that you were just kind of                looking back on it, you were amazed that -.
What was TrumpNation? What was TrumpNation?
That's the quote about Studio 54 and saying that it could probably never happen                again.
Yeah. I think that's correct. TrumpNation. Who wrote TrumpNation?
TrumpNation was Timothy O'Brien.
He was almost as bad as Wayne Barrett. I mean frankly, but TrumpNation was a zero book. That was a zero. That was total fiction. In all fairness, I would say between those two guys and probably a couple of others, but that was ... So, you took a quote out of the TrumpNation?
Yes.
I just don't know what he wrote. I sued him on that book. He wrote a totally false                book, but unfortunately, the libel law still allows that kind of a victory, but                that's OK but we'll be back with it.
What do you mean we'll be back with it?
Well, when people do false stories, I bring lawsuits.
Here is this. I'd say in 1981, Ronald Reagan wrote Cohn, a registered Democrat, a                warm note of thanks for his support. Cohn tapped into that network on Trump's behalf                a short time later according to The New York Times senior White House aide to secure                an appointment for Trump's sister, Maryann Barry, an experienced jurist in New                Jersey to the United States Court of Appeals. Trump told The Times, quote, my sister                got the appointment totally on her own merit. If The Times reported that Roy Cohn                called on your behalf, did you ask him to call Ed Meese and help your sister                out?
Yeah. I don't want to comment on that.
OK. That's the first no comment I've ever heard from you, sir.
OK. That's fine.
Why don't you want to comment on it?
I just don't want to comment on it.
Fair enough.
I'm proud of my sister. She's done a great job. I just don't comment on thas.
We talked about the birthdays a little bit, I won't bore you with that. We talked a                little bit about Trump Tower. Some of the stuff you and I have talked before about                campaign contributions and you were advised by your lawyer at one point when you                gave campaign contributions to do it through your subsidiaries. One thing that I'm                not sure about is something about John Cody. John Cody was described as a very tough                guy and a guy Representatives found he was, quote, universally acknowledged to be                the most significant labor racketeer preying on the construction industry in New                York. Cody claimed Cohn as a friend. Cody also worked with Trump. He said he also                worked with Trump with Cohn serving as the intermediary. Quote, I knew Trump quite                well. Cody said, quote, Donald liked to deal with me through Roy Cohn. What about                the John Cody relationship?
I didn't know Cody well. I know that he was a bad guy. He caused a lot of problems in                New York with labor. A nasty guy. I didn't like him. I'm not a fan of his. And I                don't know who I dealt with him. He was there with the Teamsters.
Two things that I think are interesting. One is there was an allegation that in 1980                -- not an allegation, but apparently in 1980, you were asked to talk to the                Organized Crime Strike Force. Tell me about why, what did they ask you there to talk                about Cody?
I don't remember that at all.
Oh, you don't remember giving the deposition?
I don't remember that, no. But I would have said Cody was a bad guy if I did. John                Cody was a bad guy.
Barrett reported that Cody claimed that he offered Trump peace with the union workers                in exchange for an apartment. And you told Barrett that you, quote, emphatically                denied any such deal. We're reporting that from your perspective, it never happened,                is that so?
I wouldn't have made a deal with John Cody for a lot of reasons. Number one, I                wouldn't have made a deal and number two, he was a very bad guy.
Now again, I know this isn't your favorite writer, but Tim O'Brien reported this,                "Trump claimed that Cody stayed out of his way because Cody considered him tough."                Quote, you know how I dealt with him, I told him to go fuck himself all the time.                O'Brien said that you told him.
Anything in O'Brien's book is fiction. OK. You saw that. But anything in his book                is fiction. That's been proven to be fiction, by the way.
But, is it true --?
I don't know that I ever spoke to him about Cody. I can only tell you this, Cody was                a bad guy and I didn't deal with him almost at all because I knew the kind of guy he                was. He was a very bad cookie.
Yeah.
I don't know. I never met him, but I think he was a client of Roy's.
Now Zion talks about an episode that is really interesting, and I'll just read you                the paragraph. Cohn had his setbacks and once turned to Trump for help. Cohn had                personally charted a 747 for a group of male friends to travel to Europe. The group                trashed the plane and Cohn never paid the charter bill. The airline sued Cohn                unsuccessfully but could not get any money from him. An executive called Trump to                see if he would pay. Quote, are you kidding, Trump responded. According to Cohn's                autobiography, quote, I felt for that poor bastard because Roy just wiped out that                plane. Trump told Zion about the episode, but what was I supposed to do? Hey, it was                Roy, what was anybody supposed to do? Does that ring a bell?
Oh, yes. Yeah, I do. I remember that there was an episode with an airplane with Roy                and his friends. I guess they were pretty wild, but they trashed the plane. And I                could help because I was one of their clients and it had something to do with the                airline and charter planes and things. They called me and they asked is there                anything I can do. Well, I thought I might have helped them something with Roy, but                I don't know. It was a long time ago. But I do remember that there was a plane that                was pretty well damaged inside from Roy and one of his parties. I think he had a                party on the plane or something, right?
Yeah. Apparently a non-stop party, no pun intended. You wrote yourself, quote, I                don't kid myself about Roy. He was no Boy Scout. Trump once wrote in one of his                books, quote, he once told me that he'd spent more than two- thirds of his adult                life under indictment for one charge or another. That amazed me. I said to him,                "Roy, just tell me one thing. Did you really do all that stuff?" He looked at me and                smiled, "What the hell do you think?" he said. And then you wrote, "I never really                knew."
When did I write that?
I think it was the Art of the Deal.
That's pretty much as I remember it, yeah.
O84, and we say this, "He maintained he had liver cancer but he was suffering from the effects of the HIV virus. As he                struggled to stay alive, Trump pulled back from his friend for a spell. Cohn was                apparently thrown off balance by this betrayal." Quote, I can't believe he's doing                this to me, Cohn said. According to Barrett's account, "Donald pisses ice water."                And then we talked a little bit about the disbarment proceedings and how prominent                folks, including you, weighed in on Roy Cohn's behalf but he was disbarred in any                case. That before he was disbarred that spring, you had resumed your visits to Cohn,                and that spring had invited him down to Mar-a-Lago for a brief stay. And we say that                on -.
Roy got sick, and he was pretty sick. I remember quite vividly that he lost much of                his strength. As a lawyer, he was very, very weakened, you know, physical condition.                And it was very difficult. I remember George Steinbrenner calling me on the same                thing, because he was so physically weakened that he couldn't really represent you.                He didn't have the physical strength at that point.
Do you recall the visit to Mar-a-Lago? In other words, it looks like you distanced                yourself from the before it was too late.
Roy wanted to know if he could go to Mar-a- Lago. He got a friend or something; a                woman, a society woman who he wanted to see Mar-a-Lago. And I remember that sometime                prior to his death, he toured Mar-a-Lago with the woman. This is a Palm Beach                society woman who was a friend of Roy also. I worked that out for him to do. I                worked it out for him to do.
Cohn died on August 2, 1986, he was 59. His friends, " -I'm reading from our draft.                "His friends had a memorial service for him. Trump stood in the back silently. Zion,                the journalist, wrote that Cohn was misunderstood by his critics." Quote, what                curdled their blood with Cohn was his headline hunting, his gunslinger style, his                contempt for the niceties, his contempt for them. One year after his death, Trump                professed admiration for Cohn. "Tough as he was, Roy had a lot of friends, " Trump                wrote in his book, The Art of the Deal. "And I'm not embarrassed to state that I was one." And then                based on a recent chat you had with us, we write, "Trump remains fond of Cohn                today." Quote, I actually got a kick out of him, Trump recalled in a recent                interview with The Post. Quote, some people didn't like him and some people were                offended by him. I mean they would literally leave at dinner. I had one evening                where three or four got up from the table and name. But with all of that being said,                he did a very good job for me as a lawyer. I get a kick out of winning and Roy would                win.
Yeah, it's true, fellows. That's true. He was a winner. He knew how to win if he                wanted to, if he wanted to. He had things that he wanted to do, and when he wanted                to win, he was tough.
Well, that's the overview of our story. Obviously, the link here is that his                representation of you, and the skills, the tactics, the rhetoric -he's like he was                in your face if he wanted to win. It has an uncanny similarity to some of your                approach as you're trying to win the presidency. And so that's what makes it, I                think, an interesting kind of feature story.
I was wondering why we're going on but that's OK. Look, Roy, as a lawyer was                superb. As a lawyer, if he liked his client -- and he liked a few of us, there                weren't too many of them, frankly. You understand that. But if he liked his client,                and if he liked the case, he was an absolutely superior lawyer. He could be really                great. I would say, yeah, pretty much that last sentence that you read me before was                correct.
going to be in the story. Anything that you want to add?
No. Just that he was a tough, smart guy. He was very controversial at the time. You                guys figured that one out pretty quickly, but he was very controversial. But I think                it's like Sidney said D-who was that Sid? You meant Sid Zion when you said Zion?
Yes.
Yeah, because he did have a good heart in many respects. And he fought very hard for                his clients.
How do you feel now that you've got a lot of years under the belt and you could think                about it? Let me read you a quote from somebody to give you the tenor of the                dissidence here. Bear with me. Quote, he was a great source of evil in this society,                Victor Kovner, a Democratic activist in New York City and a First Amendment lawyer,                told The Post, "He was a vicious, red-baiting source of sweeping wrong-doing." How                does it feel to call that kind of guy -- I mean, is that misguided?
Roy had two sides. Roy had people that would like him and respect him and felt very                strongly about him. Like Si Newhouse and George, and George Steinbrenner and myself,                and others. And he had people that absolutely hated him. I'd never seen anybody that                was to that extent that way. He would terrific work, and he'd have other people that                like Victor Kovner, who couldn't stand him. He'd have that. But Roy was very much                that way. There's no question about it. No, there were people that disliked him                intensely, and there were other people that thought he was terrific.
Mr. Trump, we've seen photos of Studio 54 and Roy, heard stories about his charisma.                He obviously had a big network of friends and people who were very loyal to him. And                part of that it seems was, there's a social component to him. Obviously, as a lawyer                he's very talented, but also there's a social component to his personality that                people were attracted to.
Right.
Tell us a little bit about your social interactions. There's a picture of you with                him in Studio 54, for example. Tell us a little bit about how you interacted with                him besides the parties.
It wasn't much of a social relationship. It was a business relationship. So much of                what I do is business that the people I meet are through business, so in a way that                was through business. But he was close with Ian Schrager and with Steve Rubell and                he was at Studio 54 a lot. I'd take friends to go to Studio 54. I'd go there a lot                with dates and very comfortable because I didn't know them at the time as well. I                got to know Steve and Ian very well later on, but I didn't know them at the time as                well. One thing with Roy, you always met interesting people and his parties were the                most interesting. They were glamor. They were people of great significance in lots                of different ways. You'd meet very glamorous people. You'd meet very successful                people. You met lots of different people at his events.
What was he like in that setting? He just worked the room? Obviously you'd -.
He was much more subdued in a social setting. He'd be a much more subdued guy. He                just liked to take it in and sit and watch. He was a much more subdued guy there                than he would be in a legal or business setting.
No, that's us, based on everything we've read. "Trump maintained a reputation as a                straight-laced teetotaler, but he loved to be in the mix late at night, especially                among beautiful women."
Yeah, I would certainly be there. You're talking about parties generally or kind of                --?
Yeah, you liked hanging out, but you weren't a big drinker. I've never heard -no pun                intended -a whiff of you using any drugs or anything like that.
It's never been my deal. Never been my deal.
All right. Well, you sure have a very good sense of the story. It associates you with                a guy who represented you aggressively, who showed you around a little bit, who                turned you on to people, who himself was considered by some people to be charming                and by others something of an antichrist who went after people and hurt people, and                that sort of thing.
But he also helped people. We won the tax deal on Trump Tower. What they did to me                was very unfair, and he did a great job in that case, and others. He helped people                also. Well, is this part of your fabulous upcoming book?
There is a section -- we mentioned this to you in a previous conversation for the                book, this is the piece that we're doing for the newspaper that we've done some more                reporting and written it for the newspaper. So it should run on the paper in a week                or so.
All right. Good. Well, he was an interesting character. It was an interesting                era.
While I have you, there's sort of a distilled section, and I figure I'll just share                it with you now. All right. So you meet Roy Cohn, and it's on October 1973. It's an                important relationship in your career that he represented you in legal battles,                counseled you on the prenuptial agreement, introduced you to people in New York.                "And Cohn also showed Trump how to exploit power and instill fear through simple                principles D attack, counterattack, and never apologize." Here's something we think                is fair to use, but let us know what you think. "Since he announced his run for the                White House counterattack, and not apologizing, more aggressively than any candidate                in memory."
Hey, do you think? I don't think so. Do you think so?
Oh, by far.
Really? Why should D-I'm opposed to saying that I can't believe that.
Well, if it's wrong, make your case. But it's pretty clear that -- I don't think                there's ever been a candidate like Donald Trump.
Well, that's true.
The side effect is that your opponents have felt demeaned, minorities have felt                insulted and women, and of course your supporters -- you have the ability to get                them whipped up through anger and other measures. In other words, demeaning                opponents, insulting minorities and women, and whipping up anger among your                supporters.
I think they respect what I'm saying. I think I have great supporters and I think they're extremely loyal. One thing that seems to have come out very strongly in polls and other things is that my supporters are the most loyal that anybody's ever seen to this date. We have great I guess.
Here's the thing, and I'll tell you I'm a actually a little baffled, just maybe                because I'm naive and I haven't seen it before, but the tactics of the aggression                where you are demeaning opponents and insulting people, the Mexican- American judge,                from all I can tell, and certain women, feel very insulted by some of your remarks.                Is that an overall strategy? What's that about?
I don't feel I insult people. I don't feel I insult people. I try and get to the                facts and I don't feel I insult people. I hear what you're saying but I do not feel                that I insult people. Now, if I'm insulted I will counterattack, or if something is                unfair, I will counterattack, but I don't feel like I insult people. I don't want to                do that. But if I'm attacked, I will counterattack.
Clearly. Listen, thank you, you should have a very good sense of the story. And if                anybody has any questions have Rhona call or whatever.
Just treat it fairly fellows, that's fine. Just be fair and that's it. A great honor                to talk to you guys.
Thank you. Bye-bye.
Take care of yourselves. So long. Bye.
All right.
The questions were asked and, you know, frankly, I don't even like wasting my time talking about this lawsuit. I'm going to win this lawsuit. But we should win it on summary judgment. This shouldn't be a lawsuit that goes on forever. When you have thousands of students saying that the place was great, it was a great school and they loved it, this should be dismissed on summary judgment, Bill. This shouldn't be a lawsuit.
OK. Now, you know why people ask you about Mexican things and any ethnic group, Muslims, whatever it may be. The strategy that you're going to use against Hillary Clinton and correct me if I am wrong, I can't read your mind, is that she is not suitable to be president because she is not honest. That's your strategy, right?
She is not honest. She is not -- I don't think even think she is capable.
All right.
Look at her decisions. I mean, take a look where she has gone. Every decision she has made practically and she has made so many bad decisions. She would be a disaster as president of our country.
OK. So, that's your strategy to tell the voters, look, she is not honest and she is not capable. The strategy being used against you and surely, you know this, is that you don't like Muslims. You don't like women. You don't like Mexicans, personally don't like them. And the strategy the Democratic Party is using is cleaved off these groups. All right? Demonize him within these groups and he won't have enough votes to win the presidency. And that's why they are asking you about the judge. They don't really care, they beings the press, about Trump U. They don't care. But as soon as you mention Mexican or Muslim, bang, that's why they are doing it.
All right, look, number one, I have great respect for women. I was the one that really broke the glass ceiling on behalf of women more than anybody in the construction industry. And my relationship, I think, is going to end up being very good with women. Plus, they want to see a strong country that's secure, and she is not going to be able to do that. Look at Benghazi, she was sleeping when the phone call came in. She did the ad on the phone call at 3:00 in the morning. She was sleeping. She was sound asleep or wherever she was, but she wasn't answering that call when our ambassador and the others needed help.
OK.
So you take a look. I think I'm going to do great with women. Now with Mexico, I want a strong border. There is no question about that. And with Mexico. And I'm not talking about Mexican people. You know, I have thousands of Hispanics working for me right now, Bill. And thousands and thousands over the years and they're great people. I'm going to bring jobs back. That's why I think I'm going to do well with the Hispanics.
Well, that's the play. If they buy your economic program, you'll win but, look --
Our country is losing jobs. Hey, Bill, our country is losing jobs like one after another. Whether it's carrier air conditioning or Nabisco or Ford. They are all moving out. They are building plants in Mexico. And I'm not knocking Mexico, I'm not even knocking the leader of Mexico. And the leaders of Mexico. What I'm doing is knocking our president for being grossly incompetent. He is allowing our country. They are stealing our country from us.
I got it.
And we have it stop it.
OK. Now on the women's front the Boston Globe yesterday writes that you pay men in your campaign a third more in salary than you pay women. And this goes back to my theme that this is what you're going to be confronted with, number one, is that true? Do you pay men a third more than women in your campaign?
The answer is no. And I just had it checked. Because I heard this was going to be a question. I don't know I have a good source and somebody said that this could be a question. I just checked it, Bill, and the answer is no. And, in fact, if you look at the Clinton Foundation, they pay a lot more to men than they do women. And you look at other things that she has been involved in, and, frankly, surprisingly, she pays a lot more to men than she pays to women. And that's come out over the last three or four weeks.
All right. Let me get this on the record though. The Globe says that according to Federal Commission Election records from April, all right, the last month available. That this is true, that you pay women a third less than men in your campaign. Now, there could be reasons for that.
Bill, my people just said, no. And there are reasons because there are different jobs. And that's what I heard. There are much different jobs. But generally speaking, and if you look at my company, and what I pay women versus men in many cases I pay women more money than I pay for men. Frankly now I will probably get a lawsuit from my men that work for me. You know what? I pay women for the same job more money than men.
Why do you do that?
Because they are very talented. When they're talented they are talented. I pay based on talent.
So, you pay salaries based on your perception of ability.
I pay on talent. I pay on ability, I do. I pay on ability.
All right. That's what I do.
And on the case, I have some women that are making a lot of money and they're making more money than men in comparable positions. But I just checked with my people on the election stuff, and they tell me that that's wrong. There are different jobs and different categories and everything else. But, when you end it all out, it's essentially the same.
All right. Fair interview?
Always fair.
No. No. Remember you told me I had to see a psychiatrist one time. Remember that?
No. No. No.
Sort of. I get it. If the Judge recuses himself it will be interesting but I think the judge is an honest man. I don't think he is hosing you, I really don't. I have checked him.
Well, I hope so. Look, I want him to be.
I think he is an honest guy.
I don't care if is he Mexican or not Mexican. I want him to be -- all I want him to do is give me a fair shake. When we have thousands of people says it's great, why does this thing continue to go forward.
Believe me nothing in this case is going to go unchallenged, that's for sure on both sides. Always good to see you, thank you for taking the time.
Bill, I want to focus on the economy, I want to focus on the military. I want to focus on things that we need to focus on. Not a civil lawsuit that I'm going to end up winning anyway.
My grandparents used to play a parlor game. It went like this: Tell me who you are without telling me your name or what you do. We have seen your tough exterior, but who are you at your core and what is your basic philosophy and worldview?
I am a person who grew up with two wonderful parents and a wonderful family and a person who has done well in life. I went to great schools. Wharton School, a lot of great places. Education is very important. I think I understand education. I think I can straighten out our mess in education. And I'm a person who has, to a certain extent, redefined where I should be. I started off in Brooklyn and Queens and I wasn't supposed to come to Manhattan. My father didn't want to go to Manhattan for me, and I came to Manhattan and I have done a great job in Manhattan. And then I wrote a best-seller and I wrote numerous best-sellers. I wrote 'The Art of the Deal' and numerous other books. Some were number one best-sellers. I guess 'The Art of the Deal' is the best-selling business book of all time. I had a TV show called 'The Apprentice' and it's one of the most successful reality shows in the history of television. And now I'm doing something else.
President Obama has said America is not exceptional. I know you hold another view. A lot of people would like to know why you love America, besides the opportunity it has given you to be successful and make money. What is it about this country that, as president, you would seek to preserve, protect and defend, in the words of the oath of office?
President Obama has been an unbelievable divider of this country, whether it's rich and poor; white and black. One thing I had hoped Obama would be is a good cheerleader for the country. He's really brought the opposite in spirit to the country. He's been a very negative force. I think you see this when you see the tremendous division in the country, when you see Baltimore, when you see Ferguson and St. Louis. As far as the country is concerned, we have tremendous potential, but we're not using it. I get the biggest rallies by far, much bigger than Bernie, much bigger than anybody else. And the people are phenomenal. You know my theme is Make America Great Again and I think it can be greater than ever before. But if we have four years of Hillary, I don't know if we can ever come back.
Your critics say some of the language you use is divisive. How do you get beyond that? Will there be a pivot for you from the primaries to the general election campaign, because, even though Trump University (the subject of lawsuits claiming fraud and deception) is important to you and the (Latino) judge in the (two class-action lawsuits)... you say has been unfair, these are not things that resonate with most Americans who are concerned about jobs, the economy and threats against us.
I agree. It's starting very soon because Tuesday... (was) the last day (for primaries). I will have received more votes for a Republican than anyone in the history of the primaries by millions. More than Ronald Reagan, who was a terrific guy, more than Dwight D. Eisenhower, more than everybody.... That's a great honor. Honestly, that puts a lot of weight on your shoulders because you're representing so many great people who want to see so much. And they're hungry for... I hate to use the word change because Obama used to use that word... but they're hungry for real change; they're hungry for making things right. And what I will do is put America First. People don't like to use that term of America First, but we're going to make America great again by putting America First. With our trade deals we are always second. You can pick any country and they're eating our lunch and making us look bad and so we're going to change that, Cal. We have to make our country rich again before we can make it great again. We're a poorer country. You've seen how we're stealing airplane parts for our fighter jets. We're going to do something that will make you very proud.
There are a lot of people who supported one of your opponents during the primaries. Some say they will never vote for you. Others say they are persuadable. How do you plan to persuade the persuadables who are concerned about your temperament?
I've had great success in everything I've done. When you have the most votes of anybody that tells you where the party is. I think the party got lost to a certain extent. For instance, we talk about trade. I believe in free trade, but I really believe in making great deals for the United States.
You seemed to indicate a moment ago in response to another question that you are going to do a pivot after the primaries. What would that look like?
I think it's going to be a pivot of spirit for the country, a period of smart deals for the country, a stronger military. Our military has been so badly depleted. Who would think the United States is raiding plane graveyards to pick up parts and equipment? That means they're being held together by a shoestring. Other countries have brand-new stuff they have bought from us. It's insane. We're going to have strong borders. People are going to come into the country, but they're going to come legally. We're going to keep our jobs and not let them go to Mexico.
So there will be less talk about Mexicans and other things and more about issues?
Yes, the reason I bring up the (Trump University) lawsuit, because it is a lawsuit I am going to win.... I have thousands of students who loved the school and I've been treated very unfairly in that lawsuit. I don't care if a judge is Mexican or what. What I care about is to be treated fairly. And the only reason I spent time on it is when they ask me a question, instead of saying I have no comment and then winning the case two years from now, I'd rather bring up parts of the case. For instance, you possibly didn't know I have many thousands of letters saying the course was great. And people have actually been successful after they took the course. It's worth my while to explain this because people then say, 'Wow, I never knew that.'
One of the things that most affects African-Americans is education. So many children are trapped in failing public schools and liberal politicians won't let them escape. Do you favor school choice?
I am totally in favor of choice. It's necessary and it's competitive.
You have spoken about doing away with the Department of Education. Reagan tried that and failed because Congress wouldn't let him.
I like the concept of local education. I want to get rid of Common Core. I think Common Core is a disaster. That doesn't mean there can't be a little tentacle left of the Department of Education, like 5 percent, just in terms of local coordination, perhaps. Look where we stand in the world on education. We're at the bottom of the list. So it's obviously not working.
There are two views of the Constitution. There are those who believe in a living Constitution that should align the document to the spirit of the age and opinion polls and there are others like the late Justice Antonin Scalia who believed it was settled law and should be a guide for how the country is run. Which side are you on?
I'm on Scalia's side 100 percent. His death was a tremendous loss.
Hillary Clinton said last Thursday you can't be trusted with the nuclear codes and that your thin skin might touch off a war, if you felt a foreign leader insulted you.
She's the one who raised her hand for the war in Iraq and I'm the one who has been fighting it. I've been against it from the beginning, because I said it was going to destabilize the Middle East, which it has, and on top of everything, Iran is taking over Iraq. Lots of bad things are happening. I'm the one who didn't want to go into Iraq. (Clinton) is the one who has a terrible temperament. Number one, she's weak. Number two, she has a hair trigger and it's just the opposite with me. I have a strong temperament, but our country needs a strong temperament. You have people chopping off heads of Christians and others. Not since medieval times has anyone seen anything like this. I couldn't have built the great companies I've built if I didn't have a strong temperament. And she's got a weak temperament. She's a weak person. I think she would make a horrible president.
As president, what would be your first executive orders?
My first would be to get rid of a lot of the executive orders, especially on the border where President Obama wants people to pour through like we're Swiss cheese. I would countermand those orders. Our country must have borders. Second, I would immediately start working on the military. We have to build up our depleted military. And I would start working on repealing and replacing Obamacare.
Yes, I know that. You have said you never felt the need to ask for God's forgiveness, and yet repentance for one's sins is a precondition to salvation. I ask you the question Jesus asked of Peter: Who do you say He is?
I will be asking for forgiveness, but hopefully I won't have to be asking for much forgiveness. As you know, I am Presbyterian and Protestant. I've had great relationships and developed even greater relationships with ministers. We have tremendous support from the clergy. I think I will be doing very well during the election with evangelicals and with Christians. In the Middle East -- and this is prior to the migration -- you had almost no chance of coming into the United States. Christians from Syria, of which there were many, many of their heads... chopped off. If you were a Muslim from Syria, it was one of the easiest places to come in (to the U.S.). I thought that was deplorable. I'm going to treat my religion, which is Christian, with great respect and care.
Who do you say Jesus is?
Jesus to me is somebody I can think about for security and confidence. Somebody I can revere in terms of bravery and in terms of courage and, because I consider the Christian religion so important, somebody I can totally rely on in my own mind.
The average...
And we can't allow them to change the date.
You think Bernie...
... we won by big landslides.
You called yesterday for him to resign in disgrace. Do you still stick by that today was that just something that...
Well, look he's I think he's a horrible president. I think he's been a disaster. I think the fight on terrorism is an example of it. He's been an absolute disaster. We don't fight to win. We fight to -- I think we fight politically correct wars. I mean I've even heard?? they don't bomb the oil because they don't want to pollute the atmosphere. I've heard things like that. Now, you know sometimes I think that you must be kidding. Can you imagine General Patton hearing these conversations? He's spinning in his grave. But you know, you know for a fact they tell people to get out of the truck you know because you know they're taking oil and they're taking oil and paying for oil and that's helping ISIS and if you remember Steve I said take the oil, keep the oil and that was for a long time, that was before ISIS got it and now if you look at Libya, Libya has got that oil. I mean the Libyan oil which is a a great oil, it's a very very pure oil, one of the best on earth and ISIS has the Libyan oil too and they're freely trading it. It's going out to port. We're not doing blockades. We're not doing bombings. We're not doing anything. Steve, we don't we have a president that doesn't have a clue. He doesn't know what he's doing.
Is his the the his third term. Now he's throwing in with with Hillary Clinton. Her by the way let's leave her corruption and you know how she made her money and her husband made her money. That's for another day because we've got this topic, because of this Orlando situation. But her, what she really holds herself out to be is a geostrategist, a great world leader. Do you see she over the weekend she would not say radical Islam. Do you believe that she can really stand up under scrutiny, what her track record is?
I don't think she can. I think she's very weak. I think she is a person that doesn't have what it takes. If you look at the Secret Service person who wrote the book about her, he really calls her a basket case. She's a mess and this is not presidential, and this is not a president and she's also very weak on the subject and she at some point I'm sure she'll be forced to use the term radical Islam or radical Islamic terrorism but at some point she has to be, I mean if she doesn't use the term, so at some point she'll be forced to use it. But I guess right now she's sticking with the president because she doesn't want to go to jail. You know, he's the one keeping her out of jail so he's got a lot of power over her
Do you think that's because of political correctness, that even when you mention some of these little common sense things you're deemed a nativist and a racist, and a homophobe and a a Islamophobe. And that's by the Republican establishment. You know, the gov -- Romney's government in exile that met in Park City this week the Party at Davos out there, they they mock and ridicule you on every time you bring up these kind of logical you know logical solutions. It's the Republican establishment with Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney, are they not just as bad as Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama?
Well I'm having more difficulty frankly with -- look you know the Republican Party has largely come together and they agree with me and they believe in me and you know I get more votes than anybody in the history of primary elections, OK, ever. Nobody's ever even gotten close to the Republicans and I got more than Ronald Reagan, I got more than Richard Nixon, more than Dwight Eisenhower, I got more than anybody and so they understand that you know what's going on. But I have to say that the Republicans better get smart, they better start sticking together. Romney's a loser, he lost the election badly. He should have won that election. That election was easier than this election, he should have won that election. He choked. He was a choker and I was very tough on him at the beginning because we don't want to give a choker -- I backed him, but we don't want to give a choker a second chance because we we can't afford to. And he wasn't gonna win anyway, he would have choked the same way whatever happened he was way off. He lost by a lot and now he goes around having meetings about Donald Trump. I mean he oughta go into retirement and relax because he's wasting a lot of people's time. And then something like this happens now they stop talking you know as soon as this happens they immediately stop talking about me and my views because they say well maybe Trump is right but I am right and I, I don't think my views are very different from your views Steve. We have to get very tough and very strong and very vigilant and otherwise we're not gonna have a country left.
Do you believe that Mitt Romney would rather see Hillary Clinton as president of the United States rather than Donald Trump?
I do I think so he's a you know he's a he's a jealous guy, he's got you know a lot of problems. I I watched his statement over the weekend and it was actually it was sort of sad and and pathetic at the same time. It was pathetic. But it was sad too to watch him. There's no reason for you know him to do this. Yeah he'd rather have -- even though I'm going to appoint great judges, you know we could have as many as five judges and she's going to appoint super radical liberals and I'm appointing, you know you saw the 11 names I gave and we're gonna have great judges, conservative, all picked by the Federalist Society and and I mean you know just to me incredible that they would have this. And part of the thing is they didn't get it themselves, they didn't get it and he probably still feels guilty that he lost the last election that was an election he was running against a failed president Steve, that was an election that he should have won so easy.
Last question we only got a couple of minutes but Hillary Clinton she said she was dead broke when she left the White House. AP reports they're worth I don't know two hundred million dollars today. They didn't take a company public they didn't do a leveraged recap they didn't sell a company. How are you going to hold her accountable for how she and her husband actually made that money?
I will I will be doing it, you know the movie came out and the book was great in terms of a lot of the things that they had to do to get that money and and that will be certainly one of a lot of subjects that are gonna be talked about. And that'll be that'll be up front and the Secret Service agent saying she's a basket case you know she's she's not equipped to be President. And she's not and she's not, I understand that, she's not equipped to be President. And you have more of Obama but I think even worse in a certain sense. So we'll see what happens we're in there fighting we're doing well and the polls are looking pretty good. Pennsylvania just came out, that's really looking good, and Florida and we're gonna be in there fighting unlike Romney who gave up. I mean he gave up at the end the last month you didn't even see him. And one thing I tell you Steve I don't give up. We're going to win.
Mr. Trump thank you very much for joining us on Breitbart News Daily.
Thank you very much Steve.
And one of the other things that we have learned here in the last 24 hours is that Omar Mateen was interviewed by the FBI three separate times, investigated twice, yet he was able to buy a gun relatively easily. Should something be done about that?
Well, he was licensed also, George, and you know, when you talk about gun control, when Obama mentioned that yesterday it was so inappropriate because that was no the problem. The problem was we have maniac, we have a madman. He could have used a bomb, he could have used other things just as easily, just as easily, it would have been -- probably even more devastating. So, that's not the problem...
But should there have been more of a background check for someone with that kind...
... so he went through a process.
Right, but should someone who has been on a watch list like that, who has been investigated like that, should there be an extra level of background checks before you get a weapon?
Well, you know, he was somebody, frankly, that it was -- very sad because he did slip through the cracks and the FBI has to be very upset about it. I'm a big fan of the FBI. But they have to be very -- you know, very, very distraught.
Mr. Trump, thanks for joining us this morning.
Thank you very much, George.
Yeah.
These -- there's no uniforms here. This is going to be pure intelligence gathering, and people...
Yeah.
... Muslims, where they are, they have to report these people. Otherwise it's going to be a bigger, bigger problem.
Mr. Trump, on our show this morning -- I'm sorry to interrupt. She did say that this morning. She said -- Mister...
And he's the boss, and she's afraid of him because, obviously, you know, she probably thinks he has a very profound effect over her life.
Let me jump in. I don't know if you can hear me on the phone. Let me jump in, because...
He's protecting her from going to jail. So, she's not going to us it. But I'll bet you that she would believe that she would love to use those words, because almost everybody agrees that those words should be used.
You know, but this isn't -- this isn't a refugee issue, though. I mean, this particular case is not a refugee issue. You know, this is a case -- excuse me -- this is a case of an American citizen with what appears to be multiple different motivations here.
Yeah.
So, do you...
But the Gulf stays have nothing but money. Let them pay for it, and we'll lead it. Build a safe zone in Syria, so they can stay there.
But -- all right.
But the last thing we need is to take in more people like this guy. Because you're going to have problems. This is just the beginning. You're going to have problems like this all over our country. And it's going to get worse and worse. And look what's happening in Europe. It's a mess.
Donald Trump...
But we should not be taking in more people. We have nothing -- we have enough problems in our country without doing that.
Now, if you don't know, and I don't know either, although I think that he believes that his outreach to the Muslim world that the President's personal outreach, he believes that intensifies terrorism directed at the U.S.A. I think he believes that. But you said this morning on "FOX & FRIENDS" or you implied there may be a sinister reason for him not engaging ISIS more aggressively. Do you want to define that further?
I can't define it. I mean, nobody knows what's going on. Nobody knows why he doesn't have more anger. Why he doesn't have more competitive zeal. He is a competitive person. Why doesn't he have more competitive zeal to knock them out, Bill. I mean, look at what's going on. Look at what's happening? This Orlando attack was just absolutely horrendous and, yet, he still doesn't even use the word of radical Islamic terror.
Yes. Listen, I hammered --
He won't use the words.
I hammered him in the Talking Points for continuing that ridiculous thing. Now, Hillary Clinton has backtracked on that. We're getting in the second segment with Mr. Trump. We are going to deal with Hillary Clinton. I just want to keep it on the Orlando terror attack now. In your speech today in New Hampshire, you made a lot of reference to your policy of not allowing Muslims in here, OK, on a temporary basis.
Temporary until we find out what's going on.
Who they are?
And what they have in mind.
OK. OK. But there really isn't any linkage that I can find or the FBI can find between refugees, so-called refugees, all right, women and children, primarily, coming here and violence.
So what are you asking?
Why do you think this is a centerpiece in anti-terror fighting if there really isn't any linkage in those kinds of folks coming over?
Well, I don't think you know that linkage yet? What's going to happen two years from now? What's going to happen 10 years from now? What's going to happen five years from now? Look at the Boston bombers. I mean, they were already here. Their family came here and they weren't radical when they were six, seven years old and all of a sudden they blew people up, I mean, during the Boston marathon. You just don't know what's going on here. You know, they listen to the internet and they fall in love with ISIS. Bad things are happening, Bill. And we have to get down to it, otherwise, we're not going to have a country at all. We're going to have this happening every weekend.
OK.
I mean, what happened to -- what happened in Orlando is so disgraceful and so shocking on so many levels, and we just can't have a country like this anymore, Bill. And we have to have a -- we need a president that's going to show passion to solve the problem. He sit there, he talks, it's almost like he is falling -- Bill, it's almost like he is falling asleep.
There is an urgency. Now, in the Orlando situation, the FBI had the guy under surveillance, knew he was a bad guy, didn't have enough to charge him with anything, so they say, Director Comey spoke today. Do you believe the FBI botched that case?
Look, I'm a big fan of the FBI. There is no bigger fan than me. But look, they have had better days. Let's face it. You know, they had him twice and supposedly even a third time they were looking or thinking about it. And he was a bad dude. He was a bad guy. A lot of bad things said about him. And that was a big part of my speech. The Muslims have to turn people. The Muslims, you will find out, now all sorts of things will be said about this guy and people will say oh gee, why didn't we get him? They have to turn people in.
All right. All right. Now, that being said, that being said, he didn't commit any crimes. He was totally free record up until the attack on the nightclub. His father is a provocateur. His father is a pro-Taliban guy.
Right.
And your reaction?
Well, first of all, she didn't use the words. She said she would say the words but she didn't say the words. And second of all radical Islamic terrorism. She is trying to soften it up. And she is doing that because she is afraid of President Obama who has got a lot of power over her future frankly. He could put her in jail.
All right.
No, but there is a difference. And she didn't say it. She said she would use it. And Bill, the only reason she did that is because I have been going after her saying --
You have been pounding after her. There is no doubt about it. There is no doubt about it. Now --
If I didn't do that she would have never -- Bill, if I didn't do that she would have never said those words.
Well, I don't know that. I mean, but you are much better at that Kreskin mind-reading thing than I am.
I don't want the credit. I don't want the credit.
All right.
I just said, if I didn't pound her on that, she would not have said it.
All right. You hammered the secretary today in your speech for basically saying, look, you're, you, Mrs. Clinton, are not protecting guys because your soft approach to Islam in general or Islamic fundamentalism in general discounts the fact that most Muslims, perhaps most, Sharia law certainly, have disdain towards homosexuals. You really hammered her on that. Was that fair?
I think it's fair, 100 percent fair. I'm far better for the gay community than she is. She talks a lot about it and yet she will allow people in that want to kill people from the community, from that community. And I think it's terrible. The same thing with women. They want to make women slaves, OK? They want to make women slaves. That's what they do. And, yet, she is fine with, you know, the women saying isn't she wonderful? She is not wonderful for women. She wants people coming in. She wants a 500 percent increase in people coming in from Syria that are radical Islamists, OK?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
In many cases.
She wants to take in humanitarian under the humanitarian banner as President Obama does, and the Democratic Party does. The entire party. They want to take people --
Then we should build, Bill.
OK. Wait, wait, wait, just let me ask the question.
Go ahead.
But she would refute very vehemently that she would ever allow any radical Muslim in here. She would never do that. So is it fair for you to accuse her of doing that?
Of course. Because she doesn't know who is coming in. There is no paperwork. There is no documentation. Sure, they think everyone is going to be beautiful. These people, they will tell everybody how wonderful they are and they will come in and then they will blow up a club like they blew up over the weekend or they will do something else. Bill, I mean, she is allowing these people to come in, 500 percent increase she wants. And they hate women or certainly they want women to be their slaves openly said they want to kill gays.
You are conflating both radicals and refugees. All right. Let me ask you this question.
Bill --
You know, let me ask you this question. You know there are good loyal Muslim Americans who love this country and died for this country.
True. True. I have many friends.
Mr. Trump, thanks for being with us. Obviously, the worst attack on our homeland since 9/11. I want to ask you a couple things. The FBI actually is looking into a thousand people, all across the 50 states, that are ISIS-related. Those are the investigations that are going on now. But the FBI knew this guy claimed at work that he was connected to Al-Qaeda and Hezbollah, reports he cheered after 9/11. And they looked into him for 10 months. He got free. How do we fix that?
Well, they had a bad day. I'm a big fan of the FBI, and things can happen, and I guess they didn't have anything concrete on him, and you can understand it. But we have to really increase our intelligence gathering in this country. We have people in this country that are just as bad as him, worse than him.
It happens...
There's no common sense. There's no -- there's no strength. There's no common sense. Look at what's going on in Germany. It's a mess. It's a total mess. People living in Germany want to leave.
Let me move to Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation. And I want to go through some things with you.
Go ahead.
She took up to $25 million from Saudi Arabia. She took up to $5 million from the government of Brunei and Qatar and Oman and the UAE. I want to talk about their rights. In the three cases of Saudi Arabia, Brunei and Qatar, they actually allow the assassination or the execution of gays and lesbians.
Right. That's right.
In Saudi Arabia, women can't drive, they can't vote, they can't go out in public without a male's permission. They're told what to wear. They have a morality police, four male eyewitnesses for rape under sharia. And my question to you is, she never until yesterday criticized these countries. She never until yesterday said "radical Islam."
And that's because of the pressure...
Why can't the president and Hillary Clinton utter the words "radical Islamic terrorism"?
Well, they can, but they choose not to. And a lot of people don't understand why. Personally, it doesn't -- I mean, whatever the reason is, they can't say it. Now, she said something yesterday, you know, because of me. I'm forcing her into this...
Shamed. I would say she was shamed into it.
Well, she was shamed into it, but she didn't really say the words. And she said, I would be willing to use those words, but she didn't do it.
Six months ago, she said she wouldn't use them.
Sean, Hillary Clinton, especially in these times, will be a terrible president. Her Secret Service agent said she's a disaster. She's a total disaster.
That book's coming out.
She doesn't have the temperament. She talks about my temperament. My temperament is great. It's a tough temperament, but that's what we need. Her temperament, she's wacky.
Borders, refugees, certainly -- the energy independence and intelligence, huge differences. You know, I know that the president and Hillary Clinton have made this issue about guns. But here's the interesting thing. When Muhammad Morsi, the former Muslim Brotherhood head, referred to the Israelis as descendants of apes and pigs, Obama and Hillary Clinton gave him F-16s, tanks, and $1 billion U.S. dollars. So if they're really concerned about weaponry in the hands of radicals, why would they give him all of that equipment?
Because I think that Obama treats others far better than he treats Israel. He treats Israel so badly, I have many Jewish friends, and they raise money for him and they raise money for the Democrats. I say, what are you people doing? Why would you do this? That Iran deal was the end of it. That is the worst thing, perhaps will go down as the worst --
And preventable.
It's totally preventable. It's totally preventable.
Mr. Trump, thank you for being with us.
Thank you very much. Appreciate you.
It's not --
Greta, it's not that it's different.
All right. DNC was hacked and some of the things that they got was opposition research about you. Have you heard from the DNC? Have they apologized? Have they told you anything about the security? Do you know what was taken? Have you heard from the chair woman Debbie Wasserman Schultz?
Well, knowing her, I don't actually know it, but I sort of understand her. Maybe they weren't hacked. Maybe they just wanted to get it out there. No, I have not heard. They have not apologized and they probably should be apologizing.
You don't expect to hear from them then?
I don't know. I mean, I really don't know. They should apologize, certainly.
It's very sad. I can tell you down in Orlando and, you know, contain a lot of broken hearts.
Terrible. It's terrible. It's an atrocity. It's terrible. That should never, ever, ever happen.
Indeed. And so the bottom line, if you see something, say something. That's to everybody. No matter where you are on a subway or wherever. Donald, thank you very much for joining us.
That's right. Thank you very much, Greta.
Should somebody who goes in to buy that much ammunition be -- get extra scrutiny?
Well, I think it depends. Everybody wants to be so politically correct, and they want to do what is right and they're afraid to do anything, and a word -- words that are killing us, political correctness, but, unfortunately, it wasn't followed up.
All right.
Tremendous support. Unfortunately, the media just likes to cover really a small number of people that maybe have something to say. I think they should go about their work. Let me run for president. I think I'm going to do very well.
OK, Mr. Trump, we will have to leave it there. Thanks so much for being with us.
Thank you very much, John.
It doesn't bother you? The most powerful Republican in Congress isn't telling his people to fully back the presumptive nominee?
I don't know that that's what he's saying. He has endorsed me. And I tell you, you see the crowds I'm getting, you saw last night in Houston, you see today in Nevada, I think we're going to do very, very well.
You told me recently that your campaign hasn't even really started yet.
We really haven't started. We start pretty much after the convention, during and after.
What's taking you so long? Why wait? Hillary Clinton has a big head start.
Oh, well I'm doing well. She has a head start, but I've raised a lot of money for the party. We're doing very well. Millions of dollars just this weekend.
With them or without them?
I do believe that. But I think because I obviously won the primaries without them, I'm an outsider and I won the primaries. I do believe that we can win either way. But it would be nice if we stuck together.
Last one for you before they pull me out of here. I talked with a lot of Republicans. Your critics say within your own party your campaign is not organized well enough, it doesn't have the money, and it doesn't have the infrastructure in the battleground states. How do you combat that perception? What are you doing to basically reassure people in your own party that you could actually win? There's a real, deep concern about that.
Well, if it were short of money, because we're raising a lot of money for the party. But if it were short of money for myself, I would put up my own money. I mean, I'd just put up my own money if it was at all short of money.
How much would you put up?
I'd put up whatever I need to win. I'd put up my own money. I wouldn't be that generous with it outside. I mean, frankly, people have to contribute money, people have to endorse, people have to really come through. I think, you know, the one thing they're not doing is, I've had so many endorsements, I mean, Darrell Issa called yesterday. And so many people have endorsed me. We have so many great endorsements, nobody ever talks about that.
Right.
-- cannot buy weapons, guns.
Could you get the N -- the NRA to budge on this, because they've had a firm -- they're against this idea.
Well, I...
And I -- and you -- and you're obviously pro-Second Amendment. Nobody doubts that.
Pro-Second Amendment...
So maybe...
And a pro-NRA. And, you know, they gave me, I think, the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody.
Yes, so how do you change that...
-- he was...
-- law so that somebody like that can't get a gun?
We have to be vigilant. We have to be tough. We have to be strong. If you look at his career, I mean it's all -- even going to high school, going to early high school...
Yes.
-- I mean this guy was a -- he was a bad dude.
So what does that say to you?
It says very sad, that's what it says. I mean to me, it says very sad. But they actually did report him and the authorities didn't act. And I think it's very unusual. And I'm a big fan of the FBI, but they had a little bit of a bad day.
Well, the Iranian deal is geopolitics. And he believes that he is going to keep Iran from getting the nuclear device but we will see down the road.
It's not going to happen.
But your insinuation after Orlando is a little bit more personal than that. I remember the background because you are a birther guy, you didn't believe or you questioned his birth certificate where he was born. And now you are saying in so many words and I don't want to put words in your mouth so you can clarify that look, there is something more here than just President Obama seeing the world in a non-confrontational way. There might be a personal agent here. Is that on your mind?
Well, it bothers me when is he afraid or doesn't want to mention the words radical Islamic terrorism when, obviously --
But he says it doesn't do any good to do that. It doesn't influence his policy.
I disagree with him. And then they, you know, they redact a lot of the different statements made by this thug, this horrible guy that killed all those people. And, you know, it's a disgraceful thing. So, I disagree. You know, if you have a problem you have to be able to speak openly about the problem. This is a real problem. This is worldwide.
Sure. Sure. And that's the difference between you and not only President Obama but Hillary Clinton who's, you know, you brought her a little bit more. But you are kind of dodging my question and you don't usually do that. You believe there is a personal component inside the President's personality that sympathizes with the Muslim world and doesn't want to take the Muslim world with terrorism? Is that what it's about?
I don't believe anything. I see things and whether it's the Iran deal, whether it's not wanting to mention the words radical Islam or radical Islamic terrorism or other things, Bill. You look at what's going on. I mean, it's not a question of what I think. But you look at facts. This isn't -- this isn't thinking. This is facts.
I know but you got a motive.
And I really believe this. Bill, I really believe it. No, I have no motive.
Not your motive, I'm talking about his motive.
If he were a great, let me tell you something. If he were a great president, a great, great president, and you know that's not going to happen. I would be so thrilled if our real employment was at five percent or four percent or three percent. I would be so thrilled. But it's not. Our country is in a horrible position in so many ways whether it's manufacturing, which is just -- our companies are fleeing our country with jobs. You look at what's going on with this country. It's really sad.
All right. All right. Then you have what happened.
Wait, Bill. I look at what he does and I look at what he says. And I look at what he doesn't say. Why isn't he willing -- how do you solve a problem if you are unwilling to discuss it or unwilling to name it. And now she is all of the sudden, wait a minute, Bill.
All right. He says -- he'll drop the drones on them. He'll do what he has to do. But OK. Motive is always hard.
You are always complaining. Hey, Bill, Bill, Bill, one second, you are always complaining, he is not strong enough. He is not going --
Yes. That's my opinion.
A problem which is always getting worse.
That's my opinion.
Drones are one thing but drones are not going to solve the problem.
And I agree with that. I have been very tough on him as you have in this arena.
Yes. Well, a lot of other people agree with us.
And I may have a report coming up Thursday that might shed a little light on this but we're still working it. Now, you and gun control, right? All right. Let's run down the list. They have got to tighten up the terror watch vis-a-vis buying gun list, right? That's got to happen, right?
Yes, sure. Absolutely.
OK. All right.
Who would not agree with that?
And I think the NRA would agree with it, too. But we have to have a very precise thing about, if you are on a terror watch list, this is what you can and can't do. What about the big guns? All right? You know, do people need big rifles that fire a lot of rounds? Do they need them?
Well, the big guns, first of all, are the same guns that the enemy has and that people that can break into your home or do what this maniac did over the weekend. And the big guns are the same guns. I mean, you are going to have to have that.
OK.
People use it for many other reasons. You know they use them -- they also use them for recreation, Bill. I have friends my sons are in the NRA, so am I. People use them for recreation. They use them for a lot of other reasons.
Would you put any limits on, you know, you can't have a mortar. You can't have hand grenades. You can't have a bazooka.
All right.
Would you put any limits on what you can and cannot buy.
On the guns I wouldn't because again, it's a question of protection and, also, once you start, where do you end? Where do you end?
Slippery slope?
No, I wouldn't. I get along. I get along very well with the NRA on most of these subjects. I think probably the one is that when you are on a terror watch list. Perhaps in a certain sense my stance is tougher than anybody. But when you are on terror watch list you are on. You don't get to get a gun. And basically, they are right. And they're right. No, no, they're right. There are mistakes. And by the way, there are many, many mistakes on those watch lists. And what I would do, frankly is work hard to eradicate the mistakes --
Yes.
To make sure that this people get off the list --
OK. You know, there are a lot of gun advocates and including the NRA in this, they don't want the government to know what their holding because they think the government down the line is going to seize their guns. So, rhetorically is it OK with you if the FBI knows?
I think that frankly, I've stayed and I really feel very strongly I was very honored to get the endorsement of the NRA, the earliest endorsement they have ever given. I'm pretty sure the earliest endorsement they have ever given to a presidential candidate. I have stayed with what they have been saying. And I will tell you what, Bill, these people Wayne and Chris, I think they get a bad rap. They are great Americans. They love our country. This is what they do. They really want what's good I think more than anything else for our country. And I have stayed very much with what they do.
OK.
Having to do with the watch list. I would like to meet with them. I think we are going to meet. Actually I think something is set up or will be set up.
There is not big opposition for that.
The watch list to me is very important.
OK.
The watch list to me is very important.
Mr. Trump, I want to begin by expressing appreciation to you for coming and being willing to sit at the assembly of some of the great spiritual leaders and faith leaders in America. And I'm pretty sure I'm right when I say that I don't think Hillary is gonna have a meeting like this, where she's willing to sit down with the faith community, answer questions, and speak from the heart to the people of our country. I want to say, on behalf of all these folks who are gathered, thank you.
This began as just a little event. Ben Carson came up -- we love Ben. We've become really, really great friends. He said, "Would it be possible? We have some religious leaders, we have some great evangelicals, good Christians, and just a small gathering. Maybe 100 people. I figured 15-20 minutes, maybe half an hour to see them." I said, "Absolutely, Ben. It'd be my honor." And this came out to be over 1,000 people. And you know what? That shows we all love each other, and that's so important. Ben is one of the greatest salesmen I've ever met. He said, "Do you think you can keep it going longer than the time?" And I said, "Absolutely." So we're gonna spend as much time as we need today.
After what you said about church and going to church, I have a feeling you're going to have a thousand invitations to show up at church every Sunday. I know that you have stayed far longer than originally was agreed to. We very much appreciate and respect the fact that you didn't just give us the time, you gave us way beyond what you were able to do. And I'm sure your staff is upset because we have extended your schedule.
Mike, there's nothing more important than this group of people to me.
Right.
And I guess we're tied in Ohio and essentially tied in Pennsylvania and very close nationwide.
Right.
The CNN poll is an example.
Six to seven points and...
Five points.
At this point, that -- frankly, it's so early.
It's very early.
So many people are writing as if this thing's over because -- we're a month -- almost a month from the convention.
Yes.
Yes, remarkable...
I hadn't seen them for many years. They were remarkable people. So you know, I have great respect -- I have great respect for what happened. But it's very unfair from the media standpoint.
Did you think it would be easier?
I thought it would be perhaps easier, although everyone that knew said, No, no, it's going to be more vicious because the press is so dishonest. The amazing thing, the public understands the press is dishonest, or I wouldn't be doing the kind of numbers that I'm doing in the polls.
Well, you've reached out to him, though, have you not?
No, he called me.
OK.
He actually called me. I respected the call. I thought it was good. We had a nice call, and he was nice for about a week, and then he went nasty again. So you know, it's sort of a strange thing going on.
Nature is a funny thing.
Well, it's a -- look, losing is not easy.
Right.
But a lot of people don't know that he lost. You know, now he just sits there as a senator from South Carolina, and...
Well, there are 16 people out there you beat. There's one more for you to beat.
Right.
You're focused on Hillary Clinton. You're the first Republican presidential presumptive nominee to focus on the middle class, working men and women and their families.
That's what I'm doing.
And international trade -- the first.
Right.
And in supporting the middle class, working men and women and their families, jobs and wages, you're taking on the business establishment.
True.
In terms of public policy? Talking about improving, making terrific, great trade deals, that's part of the public policy choice and direction that has to be taken. The second is -- it seems to me to recognize for this entire country -- all of the money that's socked up in lobbying from K Street goes on behalf of big business, big banks.
Hillary takes care of it.
And small business creates the preponderance of jobs.
. Correct.
. The vast majority of jobs.
. And they're forgotten.
. And yet.
She hasn't used it. She said she's going to, but she still hasn't.
She at least said, she had no problem using it. She put it in quotes.
. That's what she said.
Appreciate it. Donald Trump. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
But in terms of Corey Lewandowski, is this personal, is this a political view or philosophy, or did this boil down to something personal? It's been reported that your family members, including your daughter, did not want him in the campaign anymore.
That's absolutely true. Ivanka has great respect for him and so does my family. We like him. We had a great victory. Hey, Matt, I got more votes than anybody in the history of the Republican primaries.
One second. You just said something. I want to make sure you know what you've just said. You said that's absolutely true that Ivanka didn't want him in the campaign.
No, no, no. Well -- what I said, I was reversing it. I said it's true that Ivanka really respects Corey and it's absolutely true and she likes Corey and I read all his reports about the children and about, you know, all of this. It's all nonsense. It's absolute nonsense.
But Donald, it sounds like you're saying everything is great with Corey and yet the undeniable fact is that Corey has been fired from your campaign. Why?
We're going in a different direction because this is now different. The primaries, I ran them very lean. I spent very little money. I won in landslides -- biggest vote in history -- and won in landslides and Corey was absolutely perfect for that. We have -- to this day, you saw his interviews yesterday. We have a great relationship. But we're going in a different direction. Corey is excellent.
Well you mentioned...
Matt, excuse me, if it gets to a point, what I'll do is just do what I did in the primaries. I spent $55 million of my own money to win the primaries. 55. Now, you know, that's a lot of money, I mean, by even any standard. I may do that again in the general election.
You said -- you just said...
I may -- I have -- excuse me, Matt. I have a lot of cash and I may do it again in the general election. But it would be nice to have some help from the party.
All right. Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, we appreciate you on the phone this morning. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
You saw the numbers. Hillary Clinton and her campaign allies have spent twenty-three million dollars in eight battleground states on television advertising.
Yeah.
The Trump campaign has spent zero.
Isn't that impressive?
Do you need to fight back?
Well, let me ask you, isn't it impressive when we're even and she's spending twenty-three million and I'm spending, and I get no credit for that. When I spent less money than anybody else and won the primaries like in New Hampshire, I spent a million dollars, and a certain opponent spent eight million dollars, and I won in a landslide. Nobody said, "Gee, he did it without spending the money." That's called good business practices, and I don't know how you can spend, you know? And -- and, by the way, we're raising quite a bit of money. I'm raising it for the party. I'd rather just spend my own money. To me, it's simpler. But you don't need to spend a billion two -- a billion two hundred million dollars. In other words, she's going to spend three hundred million dollars a month because you're talking about like four months. And I just, you know, I -- I talk to my people all the time and say why do you have to spend a billion dollars? It doesn't make sense.
But she's got forty-two million dollars in the bank, you've got a million dollars in the bank. How do you run a ground campaign?
Well, you're saying me, meaning they've raised.
The campaign.
But that's -- that's from a filing, in all fairness, that only took into account one day. I don't want to devote the rest of my life to raising money from people. And, you know, when she raises this money, every time she raises money, she's making deals. They're saying, "Could I be the ambassador to this? Can I do that? Make sure my business is taken care of." I mean, give me a break. All of the money she's raising, that's blood money. That's blood money. Look, I was one of the biggest donors and I gave a lot of money to the party. I gave a lot of money to everybody. But I was a very big donor. So I understand the system better than anybody. Look, she's getting tremendous amounts of money from Wall Street; she's going to take care of Wall Street. She's getting tremendous amounts of money from lots of people. She's going to take care of all those people. And part of my campaign is, you know, that this money is being spent and she's making deals with this money.
She said your economic policies would create a Trump recession.
No. We're going to create an absolute unbelievable country. We're going to put people back to work again. We're not going to allow countries to steal our businesses.
The current plan that you've put forward, independent economic analysts have looked at it and said that it would add thirty trillion dollars to the deficit because you're going to reduce taxes, you're not going to cut entitlements, there're some questions about whether --
I'm going to bring back jobs. I'm going to bring back businesses. We're going to have a lot of people come into our country.
How?
We're going to have people come into our country -- look --
How do you do that?
-- companies now are leaving the United States. Corporate inversion, they're leaving the United States, we have almost five trillion dollars sitting out there, where they can't get the money back, they can't bring it in because there's no mechanism to bring it back in and the tax is so high. I'm going to bring tremendous amounts of money, tremendous amounts of jobs, tremendous numbers of companies, and, yes, the tax is going to be cut from the highest tax nation anywhere in the world to a fairly low tax. Not the lowest in the world but to a fairly low tax.
Hillary Clinton called you the king of debt.
Well, no she didn't call me, I called myself the king of debt. I'm the king of debt. I'm great with debt. Nobody knows debt better than me. I've made a fortune by using debt. And if things don't work out I renegotiate the debt. I mean that's a smart thing not a stupid thing. And I've made a fortune.
How do you renegotiate the debt?
Because you go back and you say, hey, guess what, the economy just crashed, I'm going to give you back half. I like debt for me. I don't like debt for the country. I like debt for my company, but I don't like debt for the country. For the country we have nineteen trillion dollars in debt. It's going to be very soon twenty-one trillion, not billion, twenty- one trillion dollars in debt. And I will tell you we are sitting on a time bomb and Hillary Clinton doesn't have a clue. And President Obama has pretty much doubled the debt since he's been in office and somebody's going to pay a big price. We have to start chopping that debt down.
Janet Yellen, who you know, the chairman of the Federal Reserve blasted you for saying that the U.S. could load up on debt and then make a deal with creditors if the economy has soured. She said there would be very severe consequences if an elected President tried to renegotiate the nation's debt.
I wouldn't renegotiate the debt. I -- I negotiate -- if I do a deal in a corporation, as an example, and if the economy goes bad, I'll oftentimes renegotiate that debt. But that's a different thing, that's just a corporate thing. And other people like me, very big people in the world of business, they do that. No, I wouldn't do that, but I think it could be a good time to borrow and pay off debt, borrow debt, make longer term debt.
There's no doubt you have broken all the rules in this race. But was, you know I think when people are looking back and seeing this time in the campaign, Barack Obama heavily outspent Mitt Romney. It really hurt him --
But they're different than me.
Yeah. Hurt him in the campaign. George W. Bush heavily outspent John Kerry. You said history doesn't matter.
Well, no, it's nice to be funded. But, you know, when I get funded, I have to go and ask people for money. When I ask them for money, they want favors. Everybody wants favors, you know, it's the way it is. And Hillary Clinton's giving a lot of favors. And she's going to have -- she's going to be owned by Wall Street, she's going to be owned by the banks, she's going to be owned by a lot of different groups, or she wouldn't be raising the money. I don't like doing that. I would rather say it like it is and -- like it is is that I don't want to spend a lot of money.
Joining me right now on the phone in the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, great to have you on the program. Thanks so much for spending the time.
Good morning.
Look, we know that the Clinton Foundation now has been hacked by Russian hackers. Are you going to be looking at the Foundation and potential conflicts there? You know, Guy Benson, who's a Republican strategist, just basically said to us "I want to hear real specifics in terms of what Hillary Clinton did." Will that be included in the speech?
Well, it will be -- a little bit of that will be, but we're going to actually do something on the foundation later. A lot of things are coming to us about the foundation. When did this hacking take place, Maria?
Yes, I mean, he tried to steal one of the cop's guns to take it out on you.
Yes.
So, is immigration going to be your first priority should you win the White House?
No, but it's going to be one of my priorities. I have many priorities --
Yes.
-- but one of them is also get our depleted military back into shape. We have a military that's totally depleted and even the current people in there are saying that. And we have -- we're depleted in every way. Our roads, our bridges, our tunnels, our schools --
Right.
-- and we have to rebuild our country. You go to some of these countries -- you go to the Middle East -- other parts of the Middle East, obviously, but you go and look at some of the things they've built. The roadways, the highways, the airports, the schools.
Oh, for sure.
It's incredible. We come home and we land at LaGuardia with the potholes --
Right.
-- and it's incredible.
What are you going to do now in terms of the money, though? I mean, you sent your first fundraising email yesterday vowing to match donations dollar for dollar for the next 48 hours --
And it did great. It did -- wait until the results -- wait until the results are in.
But when you've got -- you've got $1 million, she's got $40 million.
That doesn't matter.
Right, right.
I don't want that kind of money spent. I think it's a -- I think it's a waste of money and I think it's -- I think it's a shame, frankly. So, I can do it for much, much less and, I think, win.
And you have already. And you have already. Before you go, Mr. Trump, let me just get your take on what's going on in Britain right now with this whole movement for the U.K. to leave the E.U. What do you think Britain should be doing?
Well, I'm going to be over there during the storm because I'm going over to Scotland. We're opening Turnberry, you know. I own one of the great resorts of the world and we just completed construction and it's phenomenal. One of the great -- on the ocean -- 800 acres on the ocean.
Yes. I mean, Prime Minister Cameron said look, the vote and the thoughts to get out, that's Donald Trump politics.
No, it's not politics because it doesn't help me one way or the other. I mean, getting out or staying in makes no difference to me. It doesn't have any impact on me. I'm just saying my inclination would be -- and I also tell people don't go with the recommendation because it's a recommendation that I make, but that's where I stand.
Mr. Trump, good luck at the fundraiser this morning. Thanks very much for joining us today.
Thank you very much, Maria.
We will see you soon.
Thanks.
Tonight...
Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency!
Then the presumptive Republican nominee explains what his first 100 days in office would look like.
It's going to be America First.
Here with reaction from the Trump Organization, Donald Trump's son, Eric Trump. Good to see you. How are you?
How are you, Sean? As always.
Pleased to welcome back to the Hugh Hewitt Show now Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, welcome back, good to have you again.
Good morning.
We have had an unusual relationship this campaign season, wouldn't you say?
Well, I think it's been good. I respect you, and I think it's been good. I think it's been fine.
It's been very good. What I'd like to do, though, rather than our usual interview, is give you some of my recommendations on how to beat Hillary and get your reactions to them. Is that good with you?
It's OK. Fine.
First one, because this election is going to be about terrorism, I think you ought to name either Tom Cotton or Chris Christie as your vice president, because Cotton's, as, he's a Senator now, but as an Army Ranger, he sought out and killed terrorists, and Chris Christie prosecuted them. What do you think of those two guys?
Well, I think they're both great, and they've been very supportive. And we have a lot of support. You know, it's interesting, we have much more support than the press lets you believe, tremendous support. And you know, they may go and say well, here's a rogue person from the Republican Party, and we definitely have the people's support. You see that. You even see that in the polls. We get hammered for four weeks unfairly by the press, and the polls are just about even, and she's spending a fortune, and I'm not. So we have a lot of support. I think we're going to do great. But I like those two guys a lot. I think they're terrific guys.
Do you think that the election will turn on terror and the ability to win that war and fight it successfully, and that they would be good number twos?
Well, it depends where we are. It depends where we are in the cycle. The attack was so horrible last week. And when there's attacks, sadly, because there's nothing more horrible. You don't want to get things, but people view me as a much stronger person in terms of protecting our country, and you know, I'm doing very well in that regard. Now I don't know where we'll be. I'd like to see it, frankly, I'd like to see no attacks and a perfect country. I'd like to see a president that would do a great job even if he's a Democrat. Let him do a great, great job for the country, because as I say, it's the country first. It's America First. But we know that's not going to happen with Obama. He's not going to do a great job. That, we have figured out. So I think I do very, very well on the protection front, and on the military front, actually.
And so would Cotton or Christie help you in that regard?
Well, I can say, I can't give you any clues or anything right now, because I do have a lot of respect for those two guys. But I have a lot of respect for others, also. Chris came out very early and endorsed me. I've gotten very good, you know, very good statements from Senator Cotton, who is a, you know, who I know, whose parents I know and met. I think that he is a very talented guy. He's also very popular. He's a very popular person. So these are two names that I have high on the list for something at least, that I can tell you.
My second recommendation, and it's never been done before, but you've done a lot of things that have never been done before, is to name...
That is true.
Yeah, name a lot of your cabinet. For example, former Senator Jon Kyl at Defense, or former Ambassador Bolton at State, or former Senator Lieberman to run the CIA. Will you name members of your cabinet early so that the whole conservative movement and the middle of the country see a serious team that Donald Trump has put together to fight these so many serious battles in front of us?
Yeah, are you talking about prior to the convention, or just naming the cabinet sometime soon thereafter?
Either or both, maybe rolling out throughout the entire election season, but before the election.
I think I might be inclined to do that. I don't think that's that unusual, thought. That's been done before, hasn't it, Hugh?
No, I don't think ever we've ever had a cabinet member named. There was a hint that Colin Powell was going to be W.'s Secretary of State, but it was just a hint. I mean, if you appear with these guys...
Well, did they wait until after the election and then the cabinet...
Yes, yes.
Well, I would be inclined. I would think it's no, I would think it's no great shakes. I would be inclined to do a lot of it early. You don't have to do all of it, but a lot of it early, actually.
That is great news. I think that would really rally a lot of people to your flag.
Yeah, no, I like that idea very much.
Third one, I think you know this, the campaign is going to come down to these three debates with Hillary Clinton and you.
Right.
I agree that the polls said that. But this will be one on one. It'll be like Ali-Frazier.
But do you agree, would you say that I didn't win every debate? Or would you say, or would you say...
You at least tied for first in every debate. There were a couple...
OK, well, that's good.
Yeah, but will you find someone...
I'll accept that. Hey, Hugh, I'll accept that, right?
Will you find someone who will be as tough on you in practice as Hillary will be in reality? I mean, I'll volunteer. I'll come and throw the roundhouses at you.
Ah, that's good. Well, that's a good volunteer. Yeah, the answer is yes. And I'm starting to think of the debates. Now the debates are an eternity, you understand.
Right.
The debates are an eternity. We're talking about a long time. And I guess it's three debates, although I'm hearing four debates now, and of course, you know, based on, you know, they're saying the debate, if it's Hillary and if it's Trump, they're saying the debate's going to be the biggest show ever on television in terms of ratings. They're hearing that this could set all sorts of records. I guess maybe...
I don't know if you can beat the Cavaliers-Warriors in the seventh game, Donald Trump, but you can come close. I know what she's...
Well, no, what did they get, 30 million people?
Yup, yeah.
Well, we got 24 million people, and that was on...
So you've got to go a little bit higher.
And that was on, and think of it, that was on network, and we were on cable. So, you know...
I think I know what she's going to go at you on. Do you want to know what I think she's going to hit you on?
Go ahead. Sure.
She's going to hit you on triad, she's going to hit you on Hamas V. Hezbollah, the number of carriers, and I know the knockout punch. I think she's going to ask you about the chain of command and whether you have the chain of command mastered. Have you mastered it, yet?
I know the chain of command, and I will have a lot of things mastered. You know, as I've told you, I've been a very successful businessman. I've never done this. When they asked about NATO, as an example, I was asked by Wolf Blitzer, you know, just off the cuff, tell me about NATO, you know, on live television. And it was very interesting, because I gave an answer. I said number one, it's obsolete, number two, and it's obsolete largely because it doesn't take into account properly terrorism, and number two, people aren't paying their fair share, right? And everybody laughed at the, you know, how it was so funny, you know, and then three days later, they started saying you know, Trump is 100% right. And then if you noticed about a week and a half ago on the front page of the Wall Street Journal, a major, major announcement from NATO, first big, big announcement in years that they were going to open up essentially a terrorism division, which is exactly what I said, and that they were putting some major general or whatever in charge of it. And it was on the front page of the Wall Street Journal. Now I got no credit for that. Everybody knew, they mentioned, they did mention my name, but if it weren't, if I didn't say that, it would have never happened. And people are now giving me credit, but it's begrudging credit. So you know, I understand the system, frankly, and sometimes, I understand the system better than the people that do it. They couldn't see the forest for the trees. They were good people, but they were working at NATO for years. And one of the people who scoffed at me three or four days later said you know, Trump is right. So you know, I get it, and...
She's going to try and gotcha. That's what she's going to try and do. And I just....
Yeah, but I can...
It's going to take a...
I have plenty of gotcha for her, too, if she plays that game.
Oh, you played, you did that yesterday quite a lot, and I applaud that speech. And I specifically wanted to ask and recommend that you know how to prosecute the damage she did to national security with that server. You brought it up in the speech yesterday, but detailed, I don't think the American people get what the Russians and the Chinese got from her. You brought it up. Are you going to prosecute that case?
Yes, and frankly, it's very unfair that she's allowed to even participate in this election, if you want to know the truth. It's shocking to people. It's shocking to legal people. To your legal eagles, they are, they cannot believe that this continues to go on, because what she did is so much worse than what Petraeus did and what others did. And that she's allowed to go on this race and then get endorsed by the President, and...
I agree. I agree.
What she's done, these are criminal acts, OK? I mean, you may not like the criminal act, you may, these are criminal acts at the highest level.
I hope you just prosecute it every day, because it matters so much.
Yeah...
She compromised this country's national security.
And the amazing thing is I may do a separate speech on it. And in fact, you send me whatever material you have, because I have a lot.
All right.
But if you have any information you have on that, send it to me, Hugh, because I may just do a separate speech on that. You know, I got very high marks yesterday. It was very interesting.
Yes, you did. It was a hard-hitting...
I got high marks yesterday from people that truly, truly hate me.
Do it again and again and again, every day.
Yeah. Well, I'll be...
Hit her.
I'll be doing, I'll be doing a lot of it.
Next two recommendations, a Sister Souljah moment where you rebuke the crazy 1% out there who say they're with you but are anti-Semitic and supremacists and all, that you know, when Bill Clinton did the Sister Souljah moment, you could use one of those. I would love to hear you rebuke these people.
I see, OK, I would do that. I certainly have done that, and I think very, very strongly. Now when you say the 1%, you're talking about who"
Now just the craziest people who say they're with Donald Trump, and they're not with you. You don't like them, you reject them, but they say they're with you.
It's true. I rejected them so strongly and so harshly, and then people say he didn't reject them fast enough, breaking news, you know, it's like unbelievable. The one case, I was on television, I rejected them on television. I then rejected them on Twitter, where I have a lot, you know, where I have, well, between Facebook and Twitter, we have over 20 million people. I rejected them on Twitter, @realDonaldTrump, by the way, I'll get in a plug. But I totally rejected them on Twitter immediate after, and I still was, like it wasn't fast enough. It's a very unfair system. I'll tell you what. The system is so unfair, so unfair.
I have another recommendation about that, though.
Go ahead.
I would let the Washington Post back in. I would let the Washington Post back in and say I don't care what you say about me, come on in, you can't hurt me.
Well, you know, it's a very dishonest newspaper. And it's really there so that Amazon doesn't pay tax, and, frankly, that's just a toy for Amazon. And a lot of people think Amazon should be paying tax, and they're not, and they're destroying department stores and retailing all over the country, and that is a power tool. That is like a lobbyist for Amazon. And they have been really, really dishonest as it comes to me. I mean, you know, they're writing articles, they'll do a book, they'll put all these articles together, do a book, and they never write, I could do the greatest thing in history. I've had it many times where I said look, the press generally, but the Washington Post in particular, and the New York Times, they are so dishonest. They are so dishonest. And you do something fabulous, and they try and spin it so it's not fabulous.
But let them back in, because you only empower them by keeping them out.
Well, I'll give you an example, Hugh. So if I use my plane for, you know, for campaigning, or if we have a fundraiser or something at one of my clubs or whatever, I have to, by law, reimburse the club, right?
Correct.
By law. I can't, I'd love to not. I've love to, frankly, just do it and you know, just say it's part of the campaign. By law, I have to reimburse the aircraft and the plane and all the stuff, OK? And I'm very meticulous about it. So in the filing, we say Trump paid, you know, I don't know, whatever, X dollars for his airplane. They do stories saying that Trump receives, you know, money from his campaign. Well, that's not the truth. I mean, the fact is I have to by law. I would not to. I would love to just use my places and not charge. It's fine. It's better for me. I would like it much better. But they do stories like, and I was just amazed, because by the way, very serious if you don't. In other words, if I had an event, like we have a big news conference at one of my clubs, now it's better if I do it than if I, why should I give it to the club down the street? Or why should I give it to a hotel that's not a Trump hotel? There's no reason for that. But if I do a news conference, or if I do some kind of an event at a club, I have to, by law under federal elections, I have to reimburse at fair market and all of that stuff, right? And I do that. We do it very meticulously, and we do it. So the headline is Trump receives money from his campaign. It's so dishonest. Now they know that's dishonest, but people don't know that. You know, because I frankly think it sounds bad when you see that kind of a headline. But nobody says in there by law you have to do it. And I think it would be stupid to use somebody else's, somebody else's club or somebody else's plane. You know, it doesn't make sense. So...
Well, mull on it.
So I do it very straight down the middle. I do it exactly as the law says. And instead of saying about the law that you have to reimburse, they go out and do articles like I'm paying myself, like I'm doing some great deal. And it's just not the way it is, so you know...
I'd still let them back in. That's, you know, take it or leave it.
OK.
I think you empower them. Number eight, President Obama's legacy is in six words -- leading from behind, red line, and jayvees. I hope you'll repeat those six words every time you speak about President Obama. Those are his six word legacy -- leading from behind, red line and jayvees.
Uh-huh, and especially jayvees. Hold it. I'm going to mark that down. OK....
Good, good, and then my number nine, Eric, Donald Jr., and Ivanka should be at every single event you do, because they are your best calling card to this country.
Yeah, they're good. They're good. I watched Eric last night on television, and different shows. He's fantastic. Don is great. These guys, they, my children have done so well, I mean, so well, It's really, it's really nice. And Ivanka is getting ready to do a lot. And the women love Ivanka, and everybody loves Ivanka.
So you're liking my recommendations, so my last recommendation...
I do like you, and I do like the jayvee, leading from behind and the red line, I'm writing that down as we go.
All right, my last recommendation, do this show twice a week. It's your best training.
Well, I wouldn't mind doing it. I mean, you know, it is a little bit of a question of time. And I know you do well when we do the show, and I'm happy for you.
Oh, very well, but I...
And you sometimes treat me very well, and sometimes you don't.
Oh, I try and be fair all the time, but I do think the more time, you've already figured this out. I think I saw you say yesterday you're doing four one-hour interviews, and that will, that's worth, you know, $300 million dollars in media. I don't know what it's worth. It's worth a lot of dough. But you ought to be out there talking every day to people like me as often as you can.
Well, I have no objection to that at all. I have no objection. I like doing your show. I enjoy doing your show. You know, it was interesting, the other day before the speech, I did basically the evening news, and they were long interviews, and they were, you know, they were covered well. And I think I got very good marks. Today, I'm doing some. But yesterday, I had a lot lined up, and the speech turned out so good and I was getting such good reviews that I said cancel everything for today, let the speech speak, you know, because if I do an interview, that's going to go on and supersede the speech a little bit. So I said let the speech speak for itself. And it really did. They covered it fairly, and you know, they liked it.
And so, at the end of my ten recommendations, the last one is not a recommendation. It's are you having fun?
Honestly, I hope you think I am, because I am. I mean, I'm enjoying it. Now with that being said, it's gruesome. And guess what? I'll give you a surprise. Now I'll tell you one. We're raising a lot of money, OK? You know, when you saw that filing, that filing was for a very short period of time. And it was when we were just started, barely started. We had a day yesterday, and we had a day the day before yesterday, and we're raising a lot of money. And a lot of money is coming in on the small, you know, on the small line, on the small dollars. We're also raising a lot from the bigger donors, and that's money going to the party, by the way. That's money going to the party, because frankly, it's, in a certain way, easier for me just to self-fund, because you know, when I see the billions of dollars that people waste, and they hire consultants and the consultants make millions and millions of dollars, I honestly don't believe you have to do that, Hugh. You know, when I went to New Hampshire, they all told me, you remember this. You were one of them that said it was certainly different, but they said no, you have to go to everybody's house, and you have to go here, and you have to go there in these little groups. And I did big rallies all the time. And I said why isn't a big rally better? And the only reason they don't do them is because they couldn't get the people. And I won New Hampshire in a landslide, and won, you know, just about, and we won, you know, I ended up winning, I think it was 37 states and almost 14 million votes. And it's been a, it's been really good. No, I'm enjoying it. I wish the press was fair. They're really dishonest. The media is really dishonest. It's incredible. This, now you know, obviously there's some that are great, and some people that I have such respect for that are in the media, but generally speaking, the media is really, really dishonest, where you do good, and like for instance, over the last couple of weeks, I should have had a lot of great press for what I've done. You know, in Houston, we had a rally that maybe set records for the longest line trying to get into a place. I don't know if you saw that, but it went...
Yes.
It stretched forever. In fact, the local, the local media was fantastic, in Dallas, in Houston, the local stuff is great. But the national media is really brutal. So you know, I'd love to see the media get honest.
So last question, do you think you're going to overwhelm her the way that Reagan overwhelmed Carter late, and the polls didn't catch it, but that's, I think that's your theory of the case, that you won my hometown of Warren, Ohio. You got Democrats to reregister as Republicans in Ohio. Is that Donald Trump's theory of the case? You're just going to overwhelm her, because you're not using metrics and you're not using the online stuff?
Well, you, you, well, we're using online, etc., etc., but let me ask you. I hear I'm doing very well in Ohio. Is that a fact? I mean, you...
Yes. You got a million people to reregister from Democrat to Republican.
And that was fairly recently, right?
Yes, in the Ohio primary. I mean, you lost to Kasich anyway, but you brought in a lot of new people, and Ohio's very strong for you, and Pennsylvania is very strong for you. I don't know about this New York and California gambit. Are you still wedded to those?
Well, yeah, I'm wedded, but only in the term of speeches. I'm not going to spend huge amounts. You know, people are saying no other Republican would think about it, but it just seems that I have awfully big support in California, and awfully big support in New York. And I'll tell you another one is Connecticut. I have tremendous support in Connecticut, and you know, I was down by three points in Connecticut, and most people say that no Republican can go there. You saw the recent poll in Connecticut, which really, really surprised people. So you know, I do think I have an obligation to at least give it a shot. I think New York may be, who knows? Another one is Michigan. I'm doing very well. I'm even in Michigan. That's supposed to be one you're not supposed to be winning, but I've been talking about cars and how we're getting ripped off on trade, and our car companies especially, and you know, so I should do well in Michigan. So I think I play, Hugh, to a lot of states that are not in play for, you know, let's say one of the other people that, you know, had they won.
Will you help the down ticket Republicans, do you think?
I think so. I think they're making such mistakes by sort of saying they'll do it independently. I don't care. Honestly, I don't think I'm going to be helped. I think that they are making such mistakes, and very, you know, look, again, you read about the few that are, like I'm doing very well in New Hampshire. I'm doing very well in Pennsylvania. I'm doing very well in some of these states. And I think that if they don't embrace that, I'm fine with it. I think it's great. I actually think in a certain way, I do better if they don't embrace, because you know, I was an insurgent. I was, you know, an outsider. And I'm not sure that I'm not better being an outsider. But I have tremendous Republican support. And for the few people that want to play, you know, the independent game, I think that's fine. I don't, I really don't care.
So last question, the Cavaliers were down 3-1. No one had ever won from that position, and they did. You're down seven points in some polls. Do you just dismiss them? Are you confident, Donald Trump, you're going to win? Are you calling your shot?
Well, you can never be totally confident. I'm, I guess I'm down five points, and pretty even in two of your big states, and I heard there was a very good Florida poll that just came out, too. so I think I'm doing well there. You know, I think I'm going to win. I think people want change. They don't want to have four more years of Obama, and I think it'll be worse than Obama. But they don't want to have four more years of incompetence, four more years of Clinton with the scandals all the time. I think we're going to win. I think that the polls obviously are good. And you know, I haven't started yet, as you know. We're raising a lot of money. A lot of money is coming in, which you won't see for another 30 days, I guess. I don't know, you don't see that, I guess, until the next filing. But a lot of money is coming in. And I'm willing to put up my own money, too. You know, people don't talk about that, although they do a little bit. But I'm, I've got a lot of money, and I might put up my own money, too. I probably will at some point in this...
Donald Trump, thank you for coming back. Remember, twice a week, that's all we ask, and continued good luck out there on the hustings.
Thank you very much, Hugh, I appreciate it. Thank you.
You delivered a speech yesterday, you went hard after Hillary Clinton. She says your speech was full of conspiracy theories, and that you attacked her because you had no answers on substance. What's your reaction?
I attacked her because she has been terrible at what she does, whether it's Libya, whether it's the great migration that you see, which is largely her and certainly her and Obama. She's done a horrible job. You look all over Europe, it's a disaster what's taken place. And she'll be a terrible president. So the attack is an attack really on the fact that she will be a terrible president.
You made some very bold claims about her that didn't stand up when we put it --
Well, you don't know if they stand up. What claim are you talking about?
Well, let -- let's talk about your claim that she was asleep during the Benghazi attack.
He was left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed.
That Ambassador Stevens wasn't asking --
Were you there? Were you there? Were you with her?
She has testified before the committee that she wasn't asleep, it happened during the daytime.
Mm-Hm. OK.
There's no evidence that she was asleep.
It happened all during the day and the story was going on for a long period of time.
But I -- I guess what I'm asking, what are you -- what do you -- what do you base that on?
Excuse me, it was going on for a long period of time. And she was asleep at the wheel -- whether she was sleeping or not, who knows if she was sleeping.
Well, you said she was sleeping.
She might have been sleeping. She might have been sleeping. What? Because she put out a tweet, somebody said she put out a tweet, therefore she wasn't sleeping. Nobody else could put out a tweet? So, I don't know.
So you stand by what you said?
I can tell you this. Whether she was sleeping or not, and she might have been sleeping, it was a disaster. It was a horrific disaster and it was on her watch.
You also made the claim that her email, personal email server had been hacked.
Her server was easily hacked by foreign governments.
Suggesting that as president --
Well, you don't know that it hasn't been --
Wait a minute. But -- but suggesting that -- that she would be compromised as president. What evidence do you have?
Well, first of all, she shouldn't have had a personal server, OK? She shouldn't have had it, it's illegal. What she did is illegal. Now she might not be judged that way because, you know, we have a rigged system. But what she did is illegal. She shouldn't have had a personal server.
But is there any evidence that it was hacked other than routine phishing attacks?
I think I read that, and I heard it, and somebody that --
Where?
-- also gave me that information. I will report back to you. I will give it to you. I --
But you -- you just said it with such certainty yesterday.
I don't know of certainty. I -- probably she was hacked. You know what, you -- you can be hacked and not know it. But she probably was hacked. The fact is, she should not have it -- she should not have had a personal server.
You've been critical of Hillary Clinton for taking Wall Street money. Will you take Wall Street money?
I'm taking very little. I tell you, well we're doing very well --
But you will take some?
I don't know. I mean, we'll have to see who comes up. I mean --
But you won't take a pledge not to take Wall Street --
-- I have turned that -- let me -- let me tell you differently, I have turned down millions of dollars from people who I don't really want to give me money, OK? She's taking tremendous amounts of Wall Street money, but I put up my own money. Now, we've started raising money and I've gone to different events. And again, a lot of money is being raised for the Republican Party. I think you will be really surprised when you see the next report.
Do you plan to debate her?
Of course I do. I look forward to it.
Three times? You commit to three debates?
I think it's three debates, yeah.
You plan on -- on doing them?
Sure.
Are you preparing for the debates now?
I think my whole life has been in preparation, frankly. But yeah, sure, I'll be preparing like everybody else.
You made an -- an appeal yesterday in your speech to Bernie Sanders voters to come over to team Trump. You're asking people who support a Democratic socialist --
Yeah.
-- to come over --
Yeah.
-- to you as symbol of capitalism.
It's true. That's true. Lester, you know what?
Who just told me that he may or may not take Wall Street money.
OK. Let me just tell you why. Because I'm no fan of Bernie, but Bernie Sanders is right about trade. I mean, he's right. Now the difference between me and him is I'll do something about it. In other words, I will actually do something about it and take those horrible deals and make them great deals for the country.
Joining us now is 2016 presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, welcome back. Good to see you.
Thank you very much, Sean.
Well, let me focus on...
And he may not have started it, but boy, did he did a poor job of trying to get out of Iraq, you know, by not leaving some behind.
But we...
I didn't even want to go into Iraq in the first place, but by not leaving some behind, just to keep it a little bit stable -- it's a mess anyway, but the way he got out of there, Sean, was disgraceful.
But don't you believe...
... because what's happening now -- go ahead.
Yes.
... President Reagan, and -- you know, they got along, the president and Tip O'Neill and they got along and they could get things done. Today, it's not that way. But that's a shame, when you see that, very sad.
They actually aired a tape of how many breaths you took this morning. I'm, like, really? That's -- you know, are they going to do that to Hillary? Are they going to look into Hillary's, you know, money that she took from all these countries and didn't criticize them, that have atrocious human rights works? I don't see a lot of investigative work over there on that side of the aisle.
No, it's very unfair. I mean, I'm just telling you. Look, I don't mind -- if I do something wrong, let me have it. But you know, to be -- I'll have days which are so good, and I'll say, I look forward to seeing what happens tomorrow because that should be a very good day, and they will take things that are so good and they'll skew them and turn them, like CNN did with its -- you know, with its reporting from yesterday, where facts were skewed the wrong way by them.
All right, Mr. Trump. Thank you for being with us. Appreciate it.
Thank you. Thank you.
Now, to the top story. Let's bring in the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump who joins us now from Bangor, Maine. So, I'm looking for specifics tonight, Mr. Trump, do you have any for us?
Well, I do have them and I hate to give them out because frankly if I win, it looks like I have a pretty good chance of winning, I don't like to be giving out all of this information. I'd like to just go and do the job. If you look at General Patton he wasn't one to give out information on television and then do whatever he has to do.
Yes. But I mean, you have got to have --
We're going to have to -- I know that but I have given out plenty. Believe me. I was the one that said take the oil. And I hate it to tell everybody and we should have taken the oil when we left and we didn't do it. And who has the oil now? ISIS has the oil.
Yes. But then Iran is going to stop people from Iraq. Taking the oil is not going to stop people from blowing up airports and killing people in night clubs.
No, it's not.
And so, what I'm trying to get at here is look, I just laid out a very specific plan. All right? But it's a plan that doesn't have well we are going to invade here and we are going to have this many troops here. We're not that. But just a plan that you mobilize the most powerful alliance on the face of the earth. OK? They commit, right, to killing savages. That's a plan.
Hundred percent. Yes.
How would you do that? Would you go to Brussels and get NATO?
I would certainly do it.
They are 50 miles away.
Because of what happened.
They're 50 miles away.
They're very close.
They could get to Raqqa in two hours with a mechanized unity. But it's Muslims fighting Muslims and they don't want to do that because Turkey has its own problem.
I think they're going to do it. I think now they are going to do it. I think with the proper leadership in our country, Turkey would do it and Turkey should do it. They have a massive military. They could do it.
We would have to back them up.
As effectively as anybody.
Turkey is a member of NATO. OK.
We will back them up. We have to back them up.
Yes. Back them up with air power.
Yes.
They bring them in and they do it? But you know what?
Bill, all of a sudden Turkey is getting hit. I mean, Turkey is getting hit. And they are getting hit hard.
But you have to pound this drum. You see you have to go out there, you have to pound -- look, let me just contrast it.
I think I have pounded it pretty good actually.
There was a press conference today with the President of the United States the president of the Mexico and the prime minister of Canada Justin Trudeau. Do you know what they led with? Do you know what they led with? Protection for gays. Protection for gays. That was the lead. All right? Do you know what was second? Global warming. Big alliance on global warming.
Yes.
Nothing wrong with protecting gays. Nothing wrong with global warming. But that's the lead less than 24 hours after ISIS blows up another airport. That's what's on their mind.
Yes.
Well, they haven't gotten stronger commands and control but they are losing territory.
They are all over the place.
They are coming from a different terror organization. But there is no solution to this problem unless you devastate them and show the jihad that you are not going to take it anymore. It's all psychological now.
That's what has to be done. I agree. And not only that. The fact that they seem to have these victories. I don't know if you call that a victory, but it's a victory. It's perceived as a victory. You have through the internet, they are taking our youth and the youth from other countries all over the world, and they are joining ISIS. The youth thinks it's wonderful. Because they see victory. You know, it's being portrayed they are beating the United States.
All right. Now --
And people are joining ISIS because of that. You have got to knock them hard, you have to beat the hell out of them.
Hillary Clinton is going to have to get tougher on terrorism and she is.
She will never get tougher she is not tough enough. It's not going to happen.
She is going to get tougher at least rhetorically on terrorism. She is going to have to because President Obama's policy of containment has failed. Everybody in the world knows it's failed.
I don't see it happening with her. She is not going to get tougher. It started under her. It was a little group of people. It could have been wiped out quickly and effectively then. Now it's a very large group of people. And it's only getting bigger. And if she gets in, it will be massive and we won't even have a country anymore. We're going to be afraid to walk outside.
All right. We're going to hold Mr. Trump over.
And Bill, remember one other thing, they are letting tens of thousands of people come in from Syria and nobody knows who these people are and lot of these people are ISIS.
OK.
A lot of these people are ISIS.
Let me ask you...
And I shamed her into do it, but so far -- you know, she hasn't done it yet. She said, I would do it if I needed to do it, but she hasn't done it yet.
Yes, I think it would be a pretty big issue.
Wouldn't be pretty.
I think...
Wouldn't be pretty.
And by the way...
But she should really...
Well, it's an honest answer.
I would never attack her faith.
Yes.
I don't know how they were sending them, but they were there because they've all been accounted for.
Would you have debated the idea of asking permission to send in our military people? Would you have debated what clothes they wear?
No.
And it's hard to believe.
I know, but...
Let me -- let me ask you this.
But it has not -- it has not been a big subject, relatively speaking, for the mainstream media. They have not covered it. It has not resonated. It should have, but it hasn't.
Yes.
And so what I want to do is renegotiate trade deals so they're good, so our jobs come back, so they don't take our jobs anymore. We will have a country that will be so strong again. But right now, we're a laughingstock all over the world!
All right, Mr. Trump. As always, thank you for being with us. Appreciate your time.
Thank you.
OK.
Then in the end the recommendation was as the recommendation was. But I was surprised by that after listening to the first half of the speech. Especially the middle.
Do you believe -- do you believe there is politics involved here? Do you believe that the FBI and the Justice Department got together in some way, shape, or form and said, you know what? We're not going to disrupt the electoral process. She is running for president. We're going to cut her more slack than we would someone else. Do you believe that?
Well, my problem is that I know people in the FBI. I have such respect for the FBI that I just don't understand what happened here because you -- everybody knows, everybody realizes, I have spoken to many, many lawyers as you have and you have had them on your show and you have read about it and everybody knows she is extremely guilty and they really sensed she was guilty today and then they said, we're not going to prosecute. And then you remember what happened to General Petraeus and other people and they suffered tremendous consequences.
Yes, but it was a different as we said Petraeus had intent. He knew what he was doing. He gave it to his girlfriend. And Comey said that there was no intent by Secretary Clinton to subvert the process.
I think she had intent though. I mean, to me --
That's interesting. Now, you say that Hillary Clinton want to do subvert the national security process of this country. Is that what you are saying?
Well, she knew what she was doing, Bill. She know what she was doing --
But she can say, well, I didn't know the repercussions of what I was doing. She can say that.
Yes. But she is a lawyer. She knew what was going on. And, frankly, even if she didn't, what she did was wrong. And you know whether you had intent or not is not the defining characteristic of this. You can make a mistake and you are still guilty. You know, because you are talking about national security. And there are a lot of reasons of guilt. So, it's very, very surprising. To me I think it's really surprising. And I'm not just talking about from today, from Director Comey. I'm talking about generally speaking people would say there is no way she can avoid this because of what's happened to other people.
But you believe that she did it on purpose, don't you?
Well, I certainly believe something strange happened because when you put your servers in basements and when you, you know, look at all of the information that was just wiped clean, whether by lawyer or by anybody else, and just look at it, and we know that she had, you know, classified information on her server. And she says she didn't have classified information on her server. So when you look at all of the facts, she certainly lied. At a minimum she lied. And you are not supposed to be lying when you are dealing at this level and then you have the husband going around the tarmac and I have been on a lot of tarmacs and nobody ever runs into your plane. And he talked for 39 minutes about his grandchildren and about golf. It's not the way life is it's just not the way life happens, Bill.
So, basically what you are saying though is that the Clintons A, committed a crime because if the President was trying to influence the justice system, that would be an obstruction there. You are basically saying Hillary Clinton did it on purpose. She knew that she was going to put national security in jeopardy but she did it anyway and her husband tried to obstruct justice. That's what you are saying tonight.
Well, she knew that was going to happen because of what she was doing. It just wasn't secure. So, she knew that was going to happen. And as far as her husband is concerned, I mean, who just happens to be, you know, waiting on a tarmac and all of a sudden run in and talk about grand kids and golf for supposedly 39 minutes. I mean, it just doesn't happen that way. Life doesn't happen that way.
If you are elected president, are you going to fire Attorney General Lynch and Director Comey?
I don't want to comment on that. I really don't want to comment on that.
Why?
Because it's inappropriate at this moment. But I will tell you that I believe that what happened over the last four or five days has been a total miscarriage in justice. And I really believe that what happened is shocking. And it's certainly shocking to legal scholars and I watch them and talk to them all the time they can't believe what happened.
Do you believe --
Whether it's General Petraeus or others that have suffered grave consequences for what they did, Bill, I think it's a great miscarriage of justice.
Do you believe the fix was in and did President Obama have anything to do with it?
Well, it was very strange the timing, because I see him, you know, talking and making a speech a couple of hours after this happened. Certainly it was very strange to be having your meeting with the FBI on the, you know, one of the biggest holidays of the year. Certainly Fourth of July weekend and they are having meetings on Saturday and then the speech and everybody knew she was going to be in North Carolina on Monday and then, you know, the semi exoneration. I don't know even know if you would call it exoneration because there was so many bad things said about she did --
No. She wasn't exonerated, she just wasn't prosecuted.
She is essentially incompetent.
But you dodged my question. Do you believe --
Basically they are saying she is incompetent.
OK.
She is not dishonest, she is certainly incompetent.
Are you going to accuse President Obama of influencing the case and are you going to accuse Hillary Clinton of committing a crime?
I'm going to further look into it and we will see what we shall see. And you will be certainly one of the first to know. That I can tell you. But I'm going to look into it very, very strongly and we will see what we will see.
Now for the top story tonight. How would Donald Trump deal with the racial divide in America? I spoke with him earlier today in Chicago. So, first question for you. Do you believe there is a problem between Black and Whites in America, generally speaking?
Sadly, there would seem to be. And it's getting more and more obvious and it's very sad, it's very sad. When somebody called to a moment of silence to this maniac that shot the five police, and you know, you just see what's going on. It's a very, very sad situation. And hopefully it could be healed. We have a divider as a president. He is the great divider and I have said it for a long time. And it's probably not been much worse at any time. So it's very sad situation, actually.
All right. So if you are elected president, do you have a plan to lessen racial tensions and, if so, what is it?
Well, one thing is spirit. I mean, we don't have spirit. The country doesn't have any spirit, Bill. And, you know, we can see oh gee, well, that's just a general statement. But it's not a general statement. I mean, the country has no spirit. We need a cheer leader not a divider. We have a divider. We need a cheerleader.
There is still some Black Americans who believe that the system is biased against them. The American system because they're black, they don't get the same kind of shot, they don't get the same kind of fairness that whites do. What do you say to them?
Well, I have been saying even against me the system is rigged when I ran as a, you know, for president, I mean, I could see what was going on with the system and the system is rigged.
Yes, but that's not going to lift anybody's spirits.
We have to fight.
If you go out and say the system is rigged, that's not going to lift their spirits.
No, what I'm saying is they are not necessarily wrong. I mean, there are certain people where unfortunately that comes into play. I'm not saying that. And I can relate it really very much to myself.
I have to refocus you though on the African-American experience. All right? Do you think you understand the African-American experience? Do you think you understand it?
Well, I would like to say yes, but you really can't unless you are African-American. You can't truly understand what's going on unless you are African-American. I would like to say yes, however.
All right. If that's true, I agree with you. And then how do you persuade African-Americans who believe America is a bad place built upon grievances in the past to put that aside and lift their spirits? How are you going to do that?
Because I do understand what goes on in life. And I do understand that the economics of our country are not the same. That people are making less money today in real wages than they made 18 years ago, that our jobs are leaving the country. That our educational system stinks. It's absolutely horrible. Our educational system. And they are not part of that educational system to a large extent so I fully understand.
So, you are going to go with an economic based program to try to get more assets to African-Americans. OK. What about the police? Now, when you see something that happened in Louisiana, what happened in Minnesota, where blacks are killed by police and there is videotape and this kind of thing, what goes through your mind?
I thought they were terrible. I thought it was a terrible, disgusting performance that I saw. Now, whether that's training, whether they choked or they got scared or nervous. I mean, the one man who was being stepped on and then shot in particular, I looked at that and I said wow, that's bad. That's bad. The other one in the car, really bad but I guess they could say he was going for his license or identification and maybe thought it was a gun, so. But it was bad. Both of them were very, very sad. So maybe that's lack of training. Maybe it's bad people. I don't know. It's such a sad thing to see those two sites.
Is there anything that the President --
No question about it and then you have to go a step further.
Go ahead.
A step further when you saw the policemen shot, I mean, how bad was that? And we can't allow that to happen.
That's domestic terrorism, sure.
We can't allow any of that to happen.
But as far as the police are concerned, you say, OK, these two individual things are bad. But are they symptomatic in your opinion of a larger problem with American police? That they fear blacks or that they act differently around African-Americans? Do you believe that's in play?
Look, it could be. You have to see it. I mean, there are so many individual cases. There are certain cases where this takes place and it's horrible. I mean, somebody will meet. They will have a commission meet and the commission may have an answer, but I almost don't care what the commission says because I -- you know, I see it with my eyes. I hate what I saw, those two instances. I hate what I saw when somebody guns down all of these policemen and kills five policemen. I hate it.
Do you believe that there is a problem in American policing whereby Blacks are treated differently than Whites? Do you believe that?
It could be.
It's possible.
It could be.
As president, is there anything you can do about that?
I think it's training. It's training of the police. And by the way, I have to say, I think the police 99.9 percent, I mean, I think the police do an incredible job in this country. And you know, the problem with two instances like this which I think were terrible but they get broadcast on television.
Sure. But --
And they don't show all of the good works that the police does. There are hundreds and hundreds and thousands of cases where the police do phenomenal work. I'm a big fan of the police of this country.
OK. Black Lives Matter. I have said it's a hate group. Built upon opinion by their leadership of white supremacy keeping blacks down. How do you define Black Lives Matter?
Well, first of all, I think the term is very divisive. The first time I heard it, I said you have to be kidding. They can't use that but they just can't. I think it's a very, very, very divisive term. There is no question about it. I have heard what you have to say. I think it's a very divisive term.
The group itself, are they helping America or hurting America?
Well, I would say they are dividing America. I think that, you know, statements that I have seen, I saw what they said about the police in various marches and rallies. I have seen, you know, moments of silence called for for this horrible human being who shot the policeman. And I, you know, I have seen it and I think it's certainly -- it's very divisive and I think they are hurting themselves.
Finally, you said President Obama is a divider. Do you believe he does that on purpose? Do you believe that the President says, I want to divide the nation? I want to have strife between the races?
I don't know, Bill. I really don't know what his reasoning is. But I can tell you that I'm sitting in Chicago where we have had almost 5,000 killings deaths, from the time he became president and you don't hear too much about it. And you know, you see what's going on now, and by the way getting worse and worse and worse. I don't know. I can't speak for the President. I wouldn't want to speak for the president. I'm sure he wouldn't want me to speak for him. But, things are not going well. And I think they are going to be getting worse before they get better.
Do you know who it is right now?
Well, I have a pretty good idea. We have it down to five people.
No, no, no. You have a good idea --
Actually what I'm thinking about. I have a fairly decent idea.
It's either Pence or Gingrich. We are doing this like I have got a secret here. Remember that old show.
Yes. Very good show.
Thursday would be really good time and on THE FACTOR.
Those people know me very well.
Yes. On the FACTOR live would be the best.
We do plenty of factors.
You do and we admire you for that and I have said that and we are hoping Hillary Clinton will get on the train.
It's not easy. It's never easy but that's OK.
All right. For the ratings.
Because they like ratings.
Right.
But no, I will not be speaking every night at the convention.
Right.
But I think we're going to have a very good convention. But I don't want to change the wheel.
OK. And we look forward to covering you in Cleveland next week, Mr. Trump, as always, we thank you very much for coming on.
Thank you. Thank you very much, Bill.
And your kids were there. How did that go?
It went really well. High quality person, wonderful guy. He's always been very respectful to me and really appreciate, you know, I think appreciates what I've done politically. And we had a great meeting.
"The New York Times " editorial today, I wonder if you have seen this. "Mr. Trump is right".
No way.
"Mr. Trump is right".
I don't believe this. This is a major event. I think that's the biggest news of the week.
About Justice Ginsburg.
Well, she's a disgrace to the Supreme Court. For her to politicize the Supreme Court -- and this is all the more reason why I hope I win because I've got 11 justices that are absolutely incredible justices -- highly respected by all, including liberal people, frankly. For her to come out and to say the kind of things -- there's almost something wrong with her. I don't think anybody has ever seen that before.
You know what people have said --
Sure.
Right. But you know other candidates have done it. So I guess what I understand is it's not going to happen? We should just not expect it.
Oh, it could happen. It could happen if the audit is finished.
You're going to use a teleprompter at the convention?
A lot of people have asked me that question. They said boy, that could be a great speech without a teleprompter. But I'm probably going to use a teleprompter.
You say it's not going to happen?
Can't happen.
No way. All right. So --
By the way, if it did happen, there would be no such thing as primaries because I'd say well, let's say in four years I say I want to run or somebody wants to run. Why would they go through a full year of going to California, going to New York, going to New Hampshire, going to Iowa? All you do is go to the convention, make a little noise and see if you can get in. It doesn't work that way.
Obviously, the rules committee is going to do their thing and we'll see what comes out of there later this week. But the platform --
Well, if you look at the platform right now --
Yes.
-- the platform is largely a Trump platform. Strong on trade, we're doing something for the evangelicals, which is incredible. Take a look at what's going on with tax exempt status because, you know, they keep getting threatened that we're going to take away your tax exempt status. And we're going to do something to help the evangelicals, the Christians.
Well, you have to concede that the platform is a little bit more socially conservative perhaps than you've campaigned on.
Well, if you look at trade and if you look at --
The wall and those things -- yes.
And if you look at the wall and you look at the borders and you look at all the things, I mean a few people have said it's like a Donald Trump speech.
Sure. Republicans oppose abortion rights for women. Republicans oppose women in military combat. Do you agree with that?
Well, look, you know, no platform is ever the same way. I would say with women, if they qualify, if they qualify, and I have to say there are very few that qualify from a certain stand point.
Legalizing medical marijuana or any other kind of marijuana.
They oppose that.
Yes.
Ok.
So you're reaching out to the Bernie folks?
I think I'm going to do well with Bernie folks. I do. I think the Bernie folks are very angry that he gave up. He submitted to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He submitted.
That's a big jump to get to the Bernie folks and the social conservatives.
Well, they agree with me on trade so much. I mean on trade, we're very similar. Other than I'll make great deals out of it and he wouldn't know what to do.
Tomorrow is the one-year anniversary of the nuclear deal with Iran. Top U.S. military officials say Iran's behavior has not changed.
Sure. I said that a long time ago -- I said that before they signed it.
How would you change their behavior?
They will behave so well, and I hope they don't. This has been the worst deal that I've ever seen. I'm not talking about between countries. I'm talking about any kind of a deal. This was the most incompetently done deal. There was no walking. There was no negotiation. They won every single point. We gave them back their $150 billion which we should have never given. We didn't get our prisoners back until it was essentially signed. Those prisoners should have come -- I call them the hostages -- should have come back years ago before we ever agreed to do it.
And joining us now on the phone from his Manhattan headquarters is Mr. Trump. So let's take the terrorist act and everybody now believes that's true because the French authorities have turned over the investigation to their anti-terror unit. If this is proven to be the case, I believe it's a world war now. We are in a world war scenario. It's no longer just isolated ISIS attacks. Do you agree with that?
(by phone) I certainly do. And I have been saying it for a long time. And it's out of control. And we don't call it -- whether we have a president that doesn't want to call it what it is. And, you know, you look at World Trade Center. You look at San Bernardino. You look at Paris. A hundred and thirty people killed and so many injured in Paris from that attack. And you look at Orlando. It's out of control. And Bill, unless we get strong and you know, really strong and very, very smart leadership, it's only going to get worse.
OK. But, let's do tactics tonight. Because you could be president in five months. And then another two to be sworn in. If it's a world war, then you have to mobilize NATO. You have to get all the NATO countries to say we are going to commit forces both ground and air to wipe ISIS off the face of the earth. Do you not?
I would say that would be just fine. I have been saying it we should use NATO for its -- for a purpose. I mean, we're spending a fortune on NATO. We have countries in NATO that don't make a fair contribution. We are supporting NATO and we should at least get something out of it and getting rid of ISIS and getting rid of this cancer that we're watching all over the world, that certainly would be a good thing, a good thing for NATO to be involved in.
All right. Would you go to Congress and ask for a declaration of war?
I would. I would. This is war. If you look at it, this is war coming from all different parts. And frankly it's war, and we're dealing with people without uniforms. You know, in the old days you would have uniforms. You knew what you were fighting. These people -- we are allowing people into our country who we have no idea where they are, where they are from, who they are, they have no paperwork, they have no documentation in many cases and Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent more than even Obama and he is letting them in by the thousands.
OK.
It's out of control.
We may have Secretary Clinton later on in the broadcast. We are efforting to get her on as well. There have been or there will be by the end of the summer 10,000 Syrian refugees. Twenty percent women. Sixty percent children. Twenty percent men. So, 10,000 have been earmarked. They will be here by the end of the summer. Do you consider those people threats?
Yes.
Do you consider them security threats.
Of course I do. We have no idea. We have no idea in many cases. And I have been studying this situation so closely. Law enforcement says that you really can't tell where they come from. They may be ISIS. This could be the great Trojan horse of all time. I mean, this could be.
All right.
May be the ultimate Trojan horse.
Certainly possible but not probable.
It's possible but let's just wait. It won't take long to find out.
They know now and as I just reported, the French police would not have handed it over to the anti-terror forests inside France if they didn't suspect terrorism. Now this is directly --
Wait a minute, Bill. We have a president that doesn't want to acknowledge what our problem is, he doesn't want to use the term radical Islamic terror. We have a person running against me, Hillary Clinton. That frankly, if I didn't force her to use it and she still hasn't used the term but she said she would if she had to.
OK.
But she is another one. She is very weak and she is actually the one and him that really caused much of this problem.
By the failure to keep troops in Iraq and then that raised up ISIS, they were able to organize because we didn't have American forces there. OK. Now, this directly affected you. NBC News reported that you chose Governor Mike Pence as your vice president. That he got on a plane in Indianapolis and flew to Teterboro, New Jersey. Is that accurate?
Well, I'm not going to comment on anything. I just --
Can you just say it's accurate. It's NBC News reporting accurately?
Hold it one second.
OK.
NBC News often doesn't report accurately, that I can tell.
But in this case?
Let me just tell you. I had a news conference planned for tomorrow. And out of respect for this horrific situation, I just think it was inappropriate to have the news conference tomorrow. So, I postponed the news conference and we will announce tomorrow when it will be.
OK.
But I just felt in light of this horrible situation. This horrible attack it would be inappropriate tomorrow morning at 11 o'clock to have a news conference.
Yes. And I think most people would agree with that. Can tell me if Governor Pence is in New York tonight? I might want to take him out after.
Well, we have to call him. But let me just say this. I have great respect for Governor Pence. But I also have great respect for Newt. I have great respect for Chris, Chris Christie. We have some tremendous people in the Republican Party but I will be making the announcement at the appropriate time, Bill.
OK. You guys are slotted to do "60 Minutes" on Sunday. And I know they are expecting you to show up so you will be there with your VP pick, correct?
Well, in light of what's happened tonight, in light of this, you know, absolutely horrific attack, you know, I'm not sure that I'm feeling good about doing "60 Minutes" and I'm not sure that "60 Minutes" is going to want to do anything other than this attack. We have to get to the bottom of this. There is something very evil going on. There is something very bad going on and we better get awfully tough and awfully smart and vigilant very, very quickly. Because our world is becoming a much, much different place.
Are you, if you are going to run as the law and order candidate as you say you are, are you going to replace Loretta Lynch as Attorney General and James Comey as the head of the FBI? Are you going to do that?
Well, I don't want to comment on that but, of course, you know, I was very disappointed when I saw what happened when you go over point after point. She was proven to be a liar. She got rid of 33,000 emails. She did so many things that were so dishonest and then to hear that she gets a pass and that other people, Bill.
I can't imagine --
Their lives are ruined and destroyed, I mean, that was terrible.
But if you shake up the FBI and the Attorney General not so much. I mean, Chris Christie can do that job. But if you shake up the FBI, that would be, you know --
Well, just so you understand, I'm a big fan of the FBI. But I was very surprised at what took place last week.
All right. And that was Director Comey's call. You know that some people in the FBI wanted her to be indicted and I believe that to be true. Now, is it possible and I hate to ask questions like this but I must because everybody is locked in on the campaign and what's going to happen. Is it possible that you had your vice president selected and because of this terror attack you changed your mind where you are leaning in another direction? Did the terror attack influence your selection of your vice president?
No, absolutely not.
OK.
What's happened is, I think it would be totally inappropriate to have a news conference on a vice presidential pick tomorrow in light of, you know, so many people dead and so many people.
So whoever you picked, whoever you picked and NBC News is reporting it's Pence and they didn't couch it, they just said Donald Trump is picking Pence. Pence got on a plane. He is he in New York now. NBC News didn't couch you. They said this is what it is.
It will have nothing to do with this attack.
All right. Nothing to do. That's a good piece of information.
But I will tell you, we will be very, very strong, if I win, we will be very, very strong and we will be very, very smart.
OK. Now, I have to give Mr. Trump a compliment whether you like him or not, you're going to vote for him or not, whatever. Donald Trump reacts, all right. When we call Donald Trump, and he is the Republican nominee, all right? And you want to hear what he thinks about a terror attack in France. He gets on the phone with, what? Eight minutes, did I congeal you? I yelled at you for eight minutes. But you've got on the phone. You talked to the American people directly. And I think everybody has to admire that. I really do. Do you want a last word on it?
Well, I appreciate your statement. But, to me, it's routine. It's automatic. We had a horrific attack. Many, many people -- I mean, they have no idea how many people. I just saw scenes on television, Bill. Maybe the worst scenes I have ever seen. The bodies laying on the street.
Yes.
I think they are not going to show it so much. We have to get smart. We have to get this stopped. We are living in a different world. This is no good. So, when you call and you are right, eight minutes or five minutes or two minutes.
I mean, I really have to compliment you and people have to know that you were in a meeting, came out of the meeting. You got on the phone with us to talk to the American people directly and that's what the American people need. They need to hear from their leadership.
It's a terrible thing that's happening to the world. And when you say a phone call, it's obvious what has to be done. And we are living in this politically correct place where you have a president that won't say what it is. He won't talk about the problem. No, I believe in being direct, and I believe in solving problems and other people can't do that.
I don't know if you can remember the last time we have seen a world this much in chaos. You even said it is spinning apart. Are you both -- are you ready for this world that we are facing today?
We are both ready. I have no doubt. You need toughness. We need strength. Obama is weak. Hillary is weak. And part of it is that, a big part of it. We need law and order. We need strong borders. We have people coming to our country who can't be vetted properly. They don't have paperwork. They don't have anything. We don't even know where they come from.
Let's talk about what happened in Nice. Horrendous carnage, horrible, of innocents...
Horror.
Do you want to get us back in there?
No. I want to win. I want to win.
But...
Let me explain.
Declare war.
We have to -- we're going to declare war against ISIS. We have to wipe out ISIS. These are people that chop off heads.
Before we actually talk about the politics, you know, there have been so many major world events very recently in the last week. I don't know if you can remember the last time we have seen a world this much in chaos. You even said, it's spinning apart. Are you ready for this world that we are facing today?
We're both ready. I have no doubt. We need toughness. We need strength. Obama's weak, Hillary's weak. And part of it is that; a big part of it. We need law and order. We need strong borders.
But all reactions to what's been going on aren't muscular. For example, look what happened in Turkey. There was a military coup in a democratic country, a NATO ally. How would you respond to that?
Well, as a president, I'm going to be -- you know, they've been an ally and I stay with our allies. They have been an ally. But that was a quick coup. I was actually surprised to see how well it was handled. And you know who really handled it? The people. So, I mean, we can say what we want, but the people handled it. When they surrounded the army tanks -- and without the people, you would've never had it. The military would've taken over.
Let's -- let's talk about what happened in Nice. Horrendous carnage, horrible -- of innocence.
Horrible.
Horrible. You said you would declare war against ISIS. What exactly do you have...
It is war. By the way, it is war.
No, but does that -- when you say, declare war, do you want to send American troops in there? Is that what you mean?
Look, we have people that hate us. We have people that want to wipe us out. We're going to declare war against ISIS. We have to wipe out ISIS. These are people that...
With troops on the ground?
I am going to have very few troops on the ground. We're going to have unbelievable intelligence, which we need, which, right now, we don't have. We don't have the people over there. We are going to use...
But I still don't know if you're going to send troops over...
Very little. I'm going to...
But declare war...
... get neighboring states and I'm going to get -- we are going to get NATO, we're going to wipe 'em out. We're going to...
But you've harped on this.
But I was against the war in Iraq from the beginning.
But she's not? OK, come on...
But she's not.
She's not?
No. She's not.
Got it. I have to move on or we're never going to find out why he chose you. Why did you pick him? You had other candidates...
OK, I did. I had a lot of people that wanted it. A lot more people than anybody...
That came to you and begged you for it?
That called me, and came to me and wanted it badly. And you know, the press didn't report that. The press said, well, maybe he's having a hard time picking...
Well, what about the governor? Did he want it like that?
I actually brought it up to him.
But you went to him and said....
I did.
That I'd like to be -- but does he...
Like many others.
... how does he help you? How does he help you win in terms of groups of people?
Right.
So you must have considered, you know, obviously by the reaction to your choice, a lot of the conservatives are very happy.
Very happy.
Is he establishment?
He is very establishment in many ways, and that's not a bad thing, but I will tell you...
Is it already unified?
I think it's very close to unified. And I will say...
And that was the main thing?
And party unity is OK. You know, I think it's OK to say I picked somebody because I -- as one of the things. But I really believe the main reason I picked him is the incredible job he has done. Just look at the economics of Indiana and what's going on.
Religious?
Religious.
Are you?
Yeah, religious. Hey, I won the evangelicals. The evangelicals...
But that doesn't mean...
Nobody thought -- well, I think it means a lot. I don't think they think I'm perfect, and they would get up and they'd say, you know, he's not perfect. But they like me.
They would point to the divorces.
But I won. I won states with the evangelicals that nobody thought I'd even come close to winning. I won with a landslide.
That's true. So, you didn't need him for the evangelicals?
I think it helps. But I don't think I needed him, no. Because I won with the evangelicals.
Your gut feeling?
Don't -- I knew during the primaries, during many trips to Indiana, I'd be with him. I think we have a great chemistry.
I said campaigns ought to be about something more important than just one candidate's election. And -- and this campaign and Donald Trump's candidacy has been about the issues the American people care about.
Listen, listen.
That's -- that's negative, by the way.
Hillary Clinton -- you're going to believe it. Hillary Clinton is crook.
But I -- he's...
He's not that kind of a person. We're different people.
He's probably...
To me, she's Crooked Hillary.
Don't you think that's wrong?
I don't think he should use that term. I've never said, one way or the other. But to him, I don't think it would sound right, but he will say how dishonest she is by going over the fence.
It's probably...
I don't know. It's OK.
You know, I...
I'd like him to, if he thinks I was doing something wrong.
Would you listen to him if he said you crossed the line?
Absolutely, absolutely. I might not apologize; you know, said apologize. But...
I did say apologize.
But -- might not do that. But I would absolutely want him to come in.
Sure.
If he thinks I'm doing something wrong -- Mike, I would want him to come in and say...
Back off that?
And very likely listen to him.
Yeah, but I want to know if Mr. Pence would go in an say to you, what did you...
That's why not that many people are upset.
So you -- so, are you changing your position?
So, we're going to -- no, I -- call it whatever you want. We'll call it territories, OK?
He speaks from his heart.
I think that's a good thing.
Right.
But this is maybe more important.
You talk about...
You know, I'm not an isolationist. A lot of people think, because I want to make good deals. These are stupid people.
And with regard to other trade agreements, we've talked about this. I really do believe when the American people elect one of the best negotiators in the world as president of the United States, we would do well...
We're going to bring back our jobs.
... to negotiate individually with countries.
We're going to bring back our jobs, we're going to bring back our wealth, we're going to take care of our people. Very simple.
He's publicly said that...
I like that answer.
What I'm OK with -- what I'm OK with is protecting the American people. What I'm OK with is when people have the intent to come to this country and take American lives, that -- that we are -- that -- that we are prepared to do what's necessary to gain the information to protect the people of this country.
But Lesley, let's step further. We have an enemy, ISIS and others, who chop off heads, who drown people in steel cages and we can't do waterboarding.
OK, but, but why...
OK, they're not playing...
... would you use their techniques?
Because you know what, those techniques get information. I don't care what anyone says.
I am not...
You get information using those things.
Let's talk about the convention. You're a showman. What are you going to do to keep it from being a snooze-o-rama, as some of them have been?
Well, I think we're going to have an exciting time. We've got some wonderful speakers. We have some very talented people. My family's going to speak.
Worried about violence outside? This is an open-carry state. People can carry guns. There'll be demonstrators. They've already said they're going to carry assault rifles. Are you worried? And would you call on people not to carry their guns?
I have great faith in law enforcement. If they don't want to take their guns, I think that's fantastic. But I have great confidence in law enforcement. The police like Donald Trump. It's law and order. And I have great confidence that they will do a great job.
There's no question in anybody's mind that you want to win this election. I don't think anyone would doubt that. But what about being president? Do you really want to be president of the United States?
I want to make America great again. Honestly. I want to make -- I'm not doing this because -- I mean, I'm sacrificing tremendous things. I could be doing other things. It's lovely to sit down with you and be grilled. That's OK. But I could be doing other things right now. And I have some of the greatest properties in the world. I could be out there...
Would you rather be out there?
I'll tell you what. I've really enjoyed this process. I've gotten to know the people of this country. I've gotten to know places that I didn't know, that I read about, but I didn't know. I've also gotten to see the problems. And it's a movement. Now, when you ask me the question, do I want to be?
Yeah.
I want to be for one reason. I want to make America safe again, and I want to make America great again. That's why I'm doing this. And I love it.
And you want to govern? I mean it...
I do want to govern.
It is different building a movement...
I do -- I govern my -- I...
And then going in there with the nitty-gritty and all that tough decision making.
Sure. No, no I want to govern.
OK, this is my absolute final question.
OK.
You're not known to be a humble man. But I wonder...
I think I am, actually, humble. I think I'm much more humble than you would understand.
As you think about the prospect of running this country in these tough times where the world is spinning apart -- are you awed? Are you intimidated? Are you humbled by the enormity of this?
You just said it best.
Let's bring in Donald Trump. He joins us from, I believe, New York on this Monday morning. Mr. Trump, good morning.
Good morning.
We don't know the motive at this point, but it does feel to a lot of people, Donald Trump, like things are spinning out of control.
Well it does. I mean, you look at so many different fronts, it's, you know, radical Islam, and by the way, he seems to be a member of that group also, seems to be something going on there, but it's very sad what's happening.
Nation of Islam.
Bad people. Bad people, no question about it. Really bad.
What needs to be done to stop this? It seems this is happening more and more often where we're waking up and reporting things like this.
Well, it would be wonderful if people could turn him in. I mean, he had a lot of hate. I looked at some of his videos, they were vicious and hateful and really good people would turn him in. People know. I mean, people have an idea, at least, in some cases. You look at some of these killers in Orlando as an example, it was all over that he was bad, something was going to explode. People could turn him in -- if when they're turned in, like in the case of Orlando, people did report him and nothing happened. If we had real experts that, when they turn them in, they could nab him in some form, they could see before it was going to explode, but it's not an easy situation. There's no question about it.
Mr. Trump, we had on earlier -- Brian had a great interview with a fellow by the name of Steve Loomis, he's the head of Cleveland Detectives, and he ripped our president. He essentially said, the president has blood on his hands. He has said in interviews, his divisive rhetoric partially to blame because he's validated the anti-cop narrative, Black Lives Matter, and certain members of the mainstream media, and then he asked the question, how the hell did we, the cops, ever become the bad guys in this country?
Well, it's true. I mean, you know, I watched the President and sometimes the words are OK but you just look at the body language, there's something going on. Look, there's something going on, and the words are not often OK, by the way.
What does that mean, there's something going on?
There's just a bad feeling, a lot of bad feeling about him. I see it too. There's a lot of bad feeling about him. We have a country that has not been like this since I can remember it.
You know, the President at a forum a week ago, Newt Gingrich came out last Sunday, a guy you respect a lot, and almost was your vice president runner-up, maybe runner-up to being vice president, he came out and said, listen, the African-American community has a different experience than whites when it comes to law enforcement in this country, and you had another guy you respect a lot, Senator Tim Scott came out, and said he's been stopped seven times, and people don't know who he is, but he's a senator from South Carolina, and he believes that he was stopped perhaps because he was black. Is there something on the other side that needs to be addressed too?
Well it's probably something that we really don't know and maybe we can't feel it unless we're black. It is a -- definitely something going on there also, and that has to do with training and it has to do with something. But there is something going on that maybe, Brian, we can't recognize it or we can't see it unless you're black, and it's an experience. There's no question about that.
But you want to be president for all of America.
Excuse me?
So how do you address -- how do you address the issues of African-Americans in America if you're a white guy?
Well, you have to see and you have to put yourself in their position and you have to see what's going on. But, you know, we're at point now where it's so out of control and, I hear this week -- I have to tell you, we've dealt with the police. We've built that arena, it came out incredibly well, but we've been dealing with the police -- they are so sensitive, and they have done thus far, we're just starting -- so knock on wood as we say it, but they have been so professional, they have gone out of their way, they're being so nice to everybody -- and I'm talking about white, black -- I mean I have seen it. They have been so professional, they have been so nice, so calm. So far, they have done an amazing job.
Yes, they're doing a great job.
And I will say this. I think the police of this country are treated very unfairly. If an incident happens -- and certainly I hated watching those two events last week. I hated it and so did you. But if an incident happens, those things get blown up, you know, and they run for weeks. And the thousands and hundreds of thousands of great acts and the great job that they do, nobody gets to see that. I mean, they have been so outstanding. Some of the great people I know, they're police. They love doing it. They're proud to do it. And really, they're under attack, and now they're under attack in the true sense of the word. And we have to bring law and order back to this country, whether we like it or not. We have to bring law and order back to this country with no games.
And that's your theme tonight, make America safe again.
Well it is.
But what about the negative side? He apologized for being a negative --
We're different people. I understand that. I'll give you an example. Hillary Clinton is a liar. Hillary Clinton -- I was just proven last week. Hillary Clinton --
That's negative.
You better believe it. Hillary Clinton is a crook.
How do you feel about the interview? Do you think Lesley Stahl was fair?
I did actually think she was fair. I thought it was a good interview. I think we're different people. Mike Pence and I are very different, and that's part of the reason it works. And by the way, he was my first choice. You know, it was amazing the way the news -- the media, you talk about crooked -- the media is so distorted and so false. I read a certain person on CNN saying oh, well, it wasn't really my first -- it was absolutely my first choice, and I delayed one day because of the horrible tragedy that just took place. If I would have had it then, you talk about -- you talk about getting hit on. I would have been --
Inappropriate, yes.
It would have been so inappropriate, and what happened is I delayed it a day for that -- it was never any thought, and all of a sudden, they said because I delayed it for the tragedy, they said, well, maybe he's having second -- you know, second thoughts. And what happened -- what happened, it got carried -- oh, they wrote a source in "The New York Times", it was a total lie. It was such a lie. And when you told them it was a lie, it didn't matter, because they kept it going. Because we told them, total lie, but they kept it going. I'll tell you what, the media is so dishonest, it's incredible, just incredible.
So the "New York Times " story saying that you're upset that it leaked to "The Indianapolis Star " ahead of time and that you were having second thoughts then was totally false?
I didn't know anything leaked to "The Indianapolis star". I don't read "The Indianapolis Star", it's not high on my list to be honest with you. And they're saying oh, about "The Indianapolis Star". I said, I haven't read "The Indianapolis Star". No, the media made a big thing out of nothing. What I did is I delayed it for one day and they made that for that reason. Mike Pence was my first choice, he was my only choice. I spoke to he and his wife the night before. Once I said that, it was over. That's me. But once I said that -- and by the way, it was a great choice. And you saw it on "60 Minutes", which I thought was fair, I thought it was -- I actually thought it was a terrific interview, but they're two very different people.
Indeed. You just mentioned wife. Your wife is going to be speaking tonight, Melania Trump. We understand she's been practicing. What is the headline of her address tonight?
Well, she's going to be speaking about her love of the country. And don't forget, she came into the country, she worked hard. She came into the country, she gained legal status, as the expression goes. And she's a terrific person and a terrific woman. And she is going to -- I'll bet she gives a great speech and she's worked hard on it.
Are you talking with her?
Well, I may speak up but to be honest, I want to see this. We went so much time building the center and it got built properly. It's beautiful. It's really one of the most beautiful I have seen of its kind, and we're very proud of it, and I want to see that, and I certainly -- I want to really -- I'd love to be there when my wife speaks. So the answer is, yes, I will be there.
You do have your own plane, Donald Trump.
I do.
Have you not decided yet, or will you be there?
In my mind, I just don't want to say it, so I'll keep it quiet, just among us, I will be there. I want to watch. It's going to be very exciting.
Hey, crew, do not tell anybody. Your secret is good here.
Under no circumstances can anybody know. That's right.
Joining us now on the phone because this is a breaking news situation. The Republican nominee for President Donald Trump. So, testimony at the top of the broadcast, we were discussing the terrible police assassinations. I think it's domestic terrorism. And whether the Republican Party is going to make that issue killing police officers a campaign issue. Will you do that?
Of course. It's a big issue. It's a horrible issue. And it's going to be a very important one. It's called law and order. We want law and order. And that's going to be one of my big issues and always has been?
What about the Black Lives Matter Movement? Will they be singled out as a provocateur in this terrible situation?
Well, you see them marching and you see them on occasion, at least, I have seen it, where they are essentially calling death to the police. And that's not acceptable whether you like them or don't like them, that, Bill, is not acceptable. But I have seen it and you have seen it.
When you say it's not acceptable. If you are elected president, what can you do about a group like that?
Well, I think you have to look into it very seriously because people get themselves in big jams for saying a lot less than that. I mean, I have seen them marching down the street essentially calling death to the police. And I think we're going to have to look into that. Especially in light of what is happening with these maniacs going and shooting our police.
When you say "look into it, " there is a constitutional right, of course, to freedom of assembly and free speech. Are you saying that you would order the Attorney General to look into it for possible charges?
When you see something hike that taking place, that's really a threat, if you think about it and when you see something like that taking place, we are going to have to, perhaps, talk with the Attorney General about it or do something, but, at a minimum, we're going to have to be watching. Because that's really bad stuff and it's happened more than once.
Do you believe the group, Black Lives Matter, is a fuse-lighter in the assassinations of these police officers?
Well, certainly in certain instances they are. And they certainly have ignited people and you see that. You see that all over. And I think it's a very, very serious situation and we just can't let it happen. Now, everybody is free to say what you want to say up to a point. But when you are calling death to police and to kill the police, essentially, which is what they said, that's a real problem, Bill. That's a real big problem.
You know by saying that that the press that doesn't like you, the far left media will now start to say that you are a racist again. You know that that's what's going to happen.
Well, I'm probably the least racist person there is. And I'm doing very well with the African-American community. I'm going to bring jobs back to the country. And nobody can bring them back and you understand that, but nobody can bring them back like I bring them back. Our jobs have been stripped and whether you are talking about African-American, whether you are talking about Hispanic, whether you are talking about Asian, whether you are talking about anybody in this country, we are going to bring jobs back. And, you know, a big problem that we have, you take a look at the African-American youth, they have a 48 percent and even more than that unemployment rate, it's unacceptable.
Do you think he is being a sore loser?
Well, I don't want to say that but you know what? It was a very contentious primary. He lost very, very badly and maybe if I were in his position I wouldn't show up either.
OK. Let's go to "60 Minutes."
OK.
All right.
And very importantly, we are going to fix our depleted military. We're going to take care of our veterans. We're going to get rid of Obamacare and come up with a plan that is so much better and so much less expensive and many or things. So, it's going to be a pretty large speech from the standpoint of what it is going to cover.
All right. And, finally, the speech of the evening tonight is your wife, Melania.
Right.
What is she going to tell us?
Well, hopefully she is going to say that she really loves her husband. And she understands me. She understands me better than anybody else.
Oh, and she doesn't seek the spotlight. You know?
No, she doesn't. She has tremendous confidence. She doesn't seek the spotlight. As the expression goes, I am doing this to make America great again. She didn't need it. I guess I didn't need it either. But, you know, this is the way it happened. And I'm so happy I did it. I have gotten to know the people of this country. But Melania is going to go up and --
Is she scared? Is she nervous --
I will give her a short introduction.
Yes.
Very, very short. She is a terrific person and I think she is going to do a terrific job.
Is she scared?
I think she is a very confident person but I think she has to be a little bit. Right? You know? I don't even want to ask her the question. I don't want to put it in her mind.
You are going to introduce her, right?
I'm going to give her a very quick brief introduction.
All right.
Because I want -- this is about her. This evening is really about her. She is a great mother. She is a terrific woman. You know her. And she has been a great wife and I'm going to give her an introduction and she will go up and I think she is going to do really well.
Welcome to Cleveland.
Thank you very much.
Can I be the first to welcome you?
You can indeed.
Is it surreal to finally be here? We've talked about this week for so long.
I think it's just a great feeling. It's a great accomplishment. But the real accomplishment, and you know what it is, make America great again. That's why I'm doing it for. That's why I'm doing it.
What's your reaction to it?
It wasn't really a vote about me. That was about changing rules in the year 2020.
Well, they wanted the rules changed now, but it would have never taken place until 2020.
And we got more votes than anybody in the history of the Republican Party. It's never happened like this. And I think the press liked to build it up. But it really was about rules changes for 2020.
There's been so much violence in the country in the last couple of weeks. People are on edge. They're tense. You add to that, the passion that comes with political debate. And there are people who are truly afraid that things could boil over here in Cleveland. Would you be willing to make a pledge to speak to everyone involved in this convention and say, please tone down the rhetoric?
Sure. And I think it's going to be toned down. I think it's going to be a great rhetoric. But there's also going to be law and order. We need law and order in the country.
So can you say to the people who are going to take to that podium this week, no personal attacks, no vitriol. Keep it civil?
I think to a large extent, you know, it is a convention after all. And when you say civil, we can't be too civil when you have a situation like Hillary Clinton with all that she's done and all of the mistakes that she's made. So they'll be brought up. But I do think it will be very, very civil.
I watched your interview on 60 Minutes with your running mate Governor Mike Pence.
Right.
One of the things that came up in that was his vote in support of the Iraq war. You said in that interview, everyone is entitled to make a mistake.
Right.
You've been hammering Secretary Clinton on that exact same vote --
Sure.
-- for the better part of a year. Have you lost the right now to do that?
No, not at all. She's made a lot of mistakes. She makes too many mistakes.
But what's different about her vote --
She's got a bad judgment.
-- for that war versus Governor Pence?
Because she's wrong on the war. She's wrong on Syria. She's wrong on Libya. She's wrong on everything. She's got bad judgment. And Bernie Sanders said it. I said it also. But Bernie Sanders said she suffers from bad judgment. And she also suffers, Matt, from bad instincts.
Your campaign adviser Mister Manafort picked a little bit of a fight with the governor of this state. He criticized Governor Kasich for not showing up at this convention and supporting you. And Paul Manafort said he's being petulant and he's embarrassing the state of Ohio. Do you agree?
Well, look, he signed a pledge, number one. But honestly, he got beaten so badly. I won I guess thirty-seven states. Even more than that. And he won one. If I got beaten that badly, I wouldn't show up either. So he doesn't have to show up. It's fine.
But do you want to pick a fight with a popular governor of a state like Ohio in the early stages of this election.
He might not be popular after the convention. I don't mind that he's not here.
So is he embarrassing --
I think it's fine.
-- the state of Ohio by not showing up?
I don't want to say that. I love Ohio.
So what we want to do is pick up where we left off in March. We were listening to Speaker Ryan last night, and he presented a much more traditional Republican, engaged internationalist view of the world. One in which he said that the United States would never lead from behind. In our conversation a few months ago, you were discussing pulling back from commitments we can no longer afford unless others pay for them. You were discussing a set of alliances that you were happy to participate in.
And I think, by the way, David, I think they will be able to afford them.
They may be.
We can't.
But I guess the question is, If we can't, do you think that your presidency, let's assume for a moment that they contribute what they are contributing today, or what they have contributed historically, your presidency would be one of pulling back and saying, "You know, we're not going to invest in these alliances with NATO, we are not going to invest as much as we have in Asia since the end of the Korean War because we can't afford it and it's really not in our interest to do so."
If we cannot be properly reimbursed for the tremendous cost of our military protecting other countries, and in many cases the countries I'm talking about are extremely rich. Then if we cannot make a deal, which I believe we will be able to, and which I would prefer being able to, but if we cannot make a deal, I would like you to say, I would prefer being able to, some people, the one thing they took out of your last story, you know, some people, the fools and the haters, they said, "Oh, Trump doesn't want to protect you." I would prefer that we be able to continue, but if we are not going to be reasonably reimbursed for the tremendous cost of protecting these massive nations with tremendous wealth -- you have the tape going on?
We both do.
With massive wealth. Massive wealth. We're talking about countries that are doing very well. Then yes, I would be absolutely prepared to tell those countries, "Congratulations, you will be defending yourself."
We were talking about alliances, and the fundamental problem that you hear many Republicans, traditional Republicans, have with the statement that you've made is that it would seem to them that you would believe that the interests of the United States being out with both our troops and our diplomacy abroad is less than our economic interests in having somebody else support that. In other words, even if they didn't pay a cent toward it, many have believed that the way we've kept our postwar leadership since World War II has been our ability to project power around the world. That's why we got this many diplomats -- -- --
How is it helping us? How has it helped us? We have massive trade deficits. I could see that, if instead of having a trade deficit worldwide of $800 billion, we had a trade positive of $100 billion, $200 billion, $800 billion. So how has it helped us?
Well, keeping the peace. We didn't have a presence in places like Korea in 1950, or not as great a presence, and you saw what happened.
There's no guarantee that we'll have peace in Korea.
But we've had them there since 1953 and -- -- --
Sure, but that doesn't mean that there wouldn't be something going on right now. Maybe you would have had a unified Korea. Who knows what would have happened? In the meantime, what have we done? So we've kept peace, but in the meantime we've let North Korea get stronger and stronger and more nuclear and more nuclear, and you are really saying, "Well, how is that a good thing?" You understand? North Korea now is almost like a boiler. You say we've had peace, but that part of Korea, North Korea, is getting more and more crazy. And more and more nuclear. And they are testing missiles all the time.
They are.
And we've got our soldiers sitting there watching missiles go up. And you say to yourself, "Oh, that's interesting." Now we're protecting Japan because Japan is a natural location for North Korea. So we are protecting them, and you say to yourself, "Well, what are we getting out of this?"
Well, we keep our missile defenses out there. And those missile defenses help prevent the day when North Korea can reach the United States with one of its missiles. It's a lot easier to shoot down from there -- -- --
We've had them there for a long time, and now they're practically obsolete, in all fairness.
Relatively new missile defenses would allow us -- -- --
I'm only saying this. We're spending money, and if you're talking about trade, we're losing a tremendous amount of money, according to many stats, $800 billion a year on trade. So we are spending a fortune on military in order to lose $800 billion. That doesn't sound like it's smart to me. Just so you understand though, totally on the record, this is not 40 years ago. We are not the same country and the world is not the same world. Our country owes right now $19 trillion, going to $21 trillion very quickly because of the omnibus budget that was passed, which is incredible. We don't have the luxury of doing what we used to do; we don't have the luxury, and it is a luxury. We need other people to reimburse us much more substantially than they are giving right now because we are only paying for a fraction of the cost.
Or to take on the burden themselves.
Or, if we cannot make the right deal, to take on the burden themselves. You said it wrong because you said or -- or if we cannot make the right deal for proper reimbursement to take on the burden themselves. Yes. Now, Hillary Clinton said: "I will never leave Japan. I will never leave Japan. Will never leave any of our -- -- -" Well now, once you say that, guess what happens? What happens?
You're stuck.
You can't negotiate.
Right.
In a deal, you always have to be prepared to walk. Hillary Clinton has said, "We will never, ever walk." That's a wonderful phrase, but unfortunately, if I were on Saudi Arabia's side, Germany, Japan, South Korea and others, I would say, "Oh, they're never leaving, so what do we have to pay them for?" Does that make sense to you, David?
It does, but we also know that defending the United States is a harder thing to do if you're not forward-deployed.
By the way, and I know what I'm talking about is massive. If we ever felt there was a reason to defend the United States, we can always deploy, and it would be a lot less expense....
Can we switch to current events, recent events?
You understand what -- -- --
I do, I do.
You always have to be prepared to walk. It doesn't mean I want to walk. And I would prefer not to walk. You have to be prepared and our country cannot afford to do what we're doing.
Erdogan?
Yes, some people say that it was staged. You know that?
We've heard.
I don't think so, but I do give great credit to him for turning it around. You know, the first hour, it seemed like it was over. Then all of a sudden, and the amazing thing is the one that won that was the people. They came out on the streets, and the army types didn't want to drive over them like they did in Tiananmen Square when they sort of drived them over, and that was the end of that. Right? People said, I'm not going to drive over people. The people came out of their homes, and they were not in favor of what the military was doing. So that was quite impressive from the standpoint of existing government. I will say this: I think Turkey can do a lot against ISIS, and I would hope that if I'm dealing with them, they will do much more about ISIS.
Erdogan put nearly 50,000 people in jail or suspend them, suspended thousands of teachers, he imprisoned many in the military and the police, he dismissed a lot of the judiciary. Does this worry you? And would you rather deal with a strongman who's also been a strong ally, or with somebody that's got a greater appreciation of civil liberties than Mr. Erdogan has? Would you press him to make sure the rule of law applies?
I think right now when it comes to civil liberties, our country has a lot of problems, and I think it's very hard for us to get involved in other countries when we don't know what we are doing and we can't see straight in our own country. We have tremendous problems when you have policemen being shot in the streets, when you have riots, when you have Ferguson. When you have Baltimore. When you have all of the things that are happening in this country -- we have other problems, and I think we have to focus on those problems. When the world looks at how bad the United States is, and then we go and talk about civil liberties, I don't think we're a very good messenger.
So that suggests that you would not, as, say, President Bush did, the last President Bush, make the spread of democracy and liberty sort of a core of your foreign policy. You would say, "We need allies, we're not going to lecture them about what they do inside their borders."
We need allies.
And lecture inside their borders?
I don't know that we have a right to lecture. Just look about what's happening with our country. How are we going to lecture when people are shooting our policemen in cold blood. How are we going to lecture when you see the riots and the horror going on in our own country. We have so many difficulties in our country right now that I don't think we should be, and there may be a time when we can get much more aggressive on that subject, and it will be a wonderful thing to be more aggressive. We're not in a position to be more aggressive. We have to fix our own mess.
You said that they could be much more helpful with ISIS. I'm sure perhaps they can. The big difference they've had is that we've been supporting Kurdish forces that have been very effective -- -- --
I'm a fan of the Kurds, you understand.
But Erdogan is not. Tell us how you would deal with that?
Well, it would be ideal if we could get them all together. And that would be a possibility. But I'm a big fan of the Kurdish forces. At the same time, I think we have a potentially -- we could have a potentially very successful relationship with Turkey. And it would be really wonderful if we could put them somehow both together.
And what's your diplomatic plan for doing that?
Meetings. If I ever have the opportunity to do it, meaning if I win, we will have meetings, we will have meetings very early on.
I was going to say, when would you begin that process?
Very early on. I think it's a natural. I think it's a natural. I mean, we have two groups that are friendly and they are fighting each other. So if we could put them together, that would be something that would be possible to do, in my opinion.
You had meetings in the last couple months with James Baker and Henry Kissinger. Did they in any way change your views?
No.
Tell us how you'd capitalize on that. On the record, tell us how, in the case with Mexico.
I think we'll have a very good relationship with Mexico, and it will be a fair relationship. Right now, it's a massive, Mexico is a massive loss. A massive loss for us. But I think it will be a very, very fair relationship and a very good relationship but right now, Mexico, we are losing on the border and we are losing on trade. We have billions of dollars of trade deficits with Mexico. Drugs are pouring in across the border. And they are beating us both on the border and with trade. I think we'll have a better relationship than we do now and it will be a much more fair relationship.
You've talked about building the wall of course. Would you amend or change Nafta?
Oh, without question.
Tell us how.
Without question. Nafta -- -- --
Would you pull out of Nafta?
If I don't get a change, I would pull out of Nafta in a split second. Nafta is signed by Bill Clinton, perhaps the worst trade deal ever signed in the history of this country. It's the worst trade deal ever signed in the history of this country and one of the worst trade deals ever signed anywhere in the world. Nafta is a disaster. You have to understand, I just campaigned, as you probably read, and I won all these states, and one of the reasons was because of Nafta. Because Nafta has drained manufacturing out of New York State, out of Pennsylvania, out of Ohio, out of so many different places. It's drained. And these companies have gone to Mexico, and they've gone, they've left with the jobs. David, I have statisticians, and I know, like if I went to Pennsylvania, I say, "Give me the statistics on what is going on with respect to manufacturing." Numbers -- 45, 55, 65, I have states that are so bad. New England. Look at New England, what happened. Nafta has been a disaster for this country. And a disaster for the worker and Nafta is one of the reasons that, you know, there are people that haven't had a wage increase 18 years in real wages. Actually, they're lower, some are working two jobs, working much harder, then making less and they're older. It's supposed to work the opposite. You're making more, you're making more I hope.
What kind of change could you make in terms of Nafta without fully withdrawing from it? How could you?
You've got to be fair to the country. Everyone is leaving. Carrier just announced they're leaving. Ford is building a massive plant. So I have a friend who builds plants and then I have to go. I have a friend who builds plants, that's what he does, he's the biggest in the world, he builds plants like automobile plants, computer plants, that's all he does. He doesn't build apartments, he doesn't build office space, he builds plants. I said to him the other day, "How are you doing?" He goes, "Unbelievable." Oh, great, that's good, thinking about the United States, right, because he's based in the United States. So I said, "Good, so the country is doing well." He said, "No, no, not our country, you've got to see what I'm doing in Mexico." He said: "The business there is unbelievable, the new plants we are building. People moving from the United States." That's what he does. One-story plants. You understand?
Since your time is limited, let me ask you about Russia. You've been very complimentary of Putin himself.
No! No, I haven't.
You said you respected his strength.
He's been complimentary of me. I think Putin and I will get along very well.
So I was just in -- -- --
But he's been complimentary of me.
I was just in the Baltic States. They are very concerned obviously about this new Russian activism, they are seeing submarines off their coasts, they are seeing airplanes they haven't seen since the Cold War coming, bombers doing test runs. If Russia came over the border into Estonia or Latvia, Lithuania, places that Americans don't think about all that often, would you come to their immediate military aid?
I don't want to tell you what I'd do because I don't want Putin to know what I'd do. I have a serious chance of becoming president and I'm not like Obama, that every time they send some troops into Iraq or anyplace else, he has a news conference to announce it.
They are NATO members, and we are treaty-obligated -- -- --
We have many NATO members that aren't paying their bills.
That's true, but we are treaty-obligated under NATO, forget the bills part.
You can't forget the bills. They have an obligation to make payments. Many NATO nations are not making payments, are not making what they're supposed to make. That's a big thing. You can't say forget that.
And if not?
Well, I'm not saying if not. I'm saying, right now there are many countries that have not fulfilled their obligations to us.
You've seen several of those countries come under cyber attack, things that are short of war, clearly appear to be coming from Russia.
Well, we're under cyber attack.
We're under regular cyber attack. Would you use cyberweapons before you used military force?
Cyber is absolutely a thing of the future and the present. Look, we're under cyber attack, forget about them. And we don't even know where it's coming from.
Some days we do, and some days we don't.
Because we're obsolete. Right now, Russia and China in particular and other places.
Would you support the United States ' not only developing as we are but fielding cyberweapons as an alternative?
Yes. I am a fan of the future, and cyber is the future.
President Obama, as you probably know, as you probably read, is considering a no-first-use pledge before he leaves office for nuclear weapons. We don't have one right now. Some other nations do, some don't. Would you consider that stabilizing?
Depends on who we are talking about, it depends on who we are talking about. I would only make that commitment as the agreement is being signed. I wouldn't want to play my cards. I don't want to say that.
This would be a declaratory policy of the United States.
I understand. I will do everything within my power never to be in a position where we have to use nuclear power because that's a whole different ballgame. That's very important to me. I will do everything in my power never to be in a position where we will have to use nuclear power. It's very important to me.
President Obama, as you know, has talked about reducing the number of nuclear weapons in the American arsenal and hopefully getting to the point, maybe not in our lifetimes, of no nuclear weapons. Do you believe at this point that we have sufficient forces that we could come down unilaterally?
I only like that premise if nobody else has them. But that's never going to happen.
Do you think we have too many weapons than we actually need to defend the United States?
I think we have a lot of obsolete weapons.
We certainly do.
We have nuclear that we don't even know if it works. We have nuclear where the telephone systems are 40 years old and they have wire that's so corroded that they can't call from one station to the next.
Well that raises the question whether we need that part of the triad?
Yes. Yes, I think you need all three parts, but -- but we have, much of what we have is obsolete. Now, Russia, if you look at what they're doing, they're building submarines, they're going to a level....
You've been a little bit vague about what we'd do with ISIS other than bomb the hell out of them.
I don't want to be specific because I don't want ISIS to know what I'm planning. I do have ideas, very strong ideas on ISIS.
Do any of them involve diplomacy, as opposed to -- in other words, diplomacy in terms of getting Russia and others to help cut them off?
Oh, I would love to have a good relationship where Russia and I, instead of, and us, and the U.S., instead of fighting each other we got along. It would be wonderful if we had good relationships with Russia so that we don't have to go through all of the drama.
You would keep Assad there if he's also fighting ISIS?
I don't want to say that, I have a very specific view on Assad, but I think we have to get rid of ISIS before we get rid of Assad.
So you agree with President Obama in that regard?
Look, Assad hates ISIS; ISIS hates Assad. They are fighting each other. We are supposed to go and fight them both? How do you fight them both when they are fighting each other? And I think that ISIS is a threat that's much more important for us right now than Assad. You understand what I'm saying?
Mmm.
Because Assad and ISIS are fighting. Now we are going to go in and fight them both, because we have people that don't know what they are doing. We have people that don't know what they are doing. So I would get rid of ISIS, but I don't want to fight at the same time. The other thing you have is, is Assad is backed by a country that we made a power, OK? Iran. And Russia, OK? So why didn't we do something about that before we made Iran rich, and before we gave them this tremendous power that they now have, that they didn't have and shouldn't have had?
We haven't given them very much right now.
Well, you've given them $150 billion.
They've gotten a few billion. At this point, they've gotten a few billion.
They're getting a lot of money. And they have an agreement that's a terrible agreement in my opinion. It's an agreement that will get them to nuclear quicker than had we had no agreement. But that's a different question. You asked me about Assad. So Assad is a bad man. Done horrible things. We have to get ISIS first, and you don't want to fight them both at the same time when they are fighting each other. So I hope you treat me fairly. And I hope you say that I do know my subject. And I do know it. I know it better than, I know it better than the people that do it for -- -- --
We're going to run a transcript -- Let me ask you one quick question because I can't not ask. Do you have anything more you want to say about either Meredith McIver or what happened this week?
No, it's fine. I wanted to protect her. She's been a person that's been very good -- -- --
I did.
And she came and she said, "Mr. Trump, I'd like to say what happened." I thought it was such a nice thing.
When did she come to you yesterday?
Two days ago?
She did?
Yeah.
Right away? OK
Who knew this was going to be a big story? What I'm saying is, she came in after the speech. But she was, I thought that was very nice.
And she offered and you said no?
Well, originally, but I didn't know it was going to be a big story. She was more interested in, because Melania did a phenomenal job -- -- --
Her speech was very well received.
Very well received. And she was more interested in getting that straight, because she thought it was very unfair to Melania, who did a phenomenal job. And I'm glad, it was very nice that she did it. She offered her resignation. I said, "I really appreciate what you did." I think it's terrific that she came forward instead of me going to her and I said, "I won't accept it, " and she was thrilled with that. She was happy with it.
Is there anything you would do differently going forward with how speeches are handled?
Look, Obama copied a speech from Massachusetts. Joe Biden is famous for copying speeches. Obama had another one with Bush, I read it I think in your paper. I've been reading about this stuff all my life. It happens, it can happen. In this case, it happened. You know the story. By the way, the letter cleared up everything, cleared up everything. The only thing is, if I had done it a day earlier it would have been better.
It would have ended it -- -- --
A day earlier, in retrospect. But I didn't clear it up and people are giving, I think, everybody a lot of credit right now.
What do you think people will take away from this convention? What are you hoping?
From the convention? The fact that I'm very well liked. Look, I got more votes than anybody in the history of the Republican Party. Almost 14 million votes. I got 37 states. Kasich has one. As an example, Ted had, you know, not many. Thirty-seven states. Now, with the roll call, I had 44 states. It was 44 to seven and the seven was everybody else: 44 to seven. It was 44 to six because we are including the different islands. And when you are in that hall and you see those people, like yesterday, my daughter called up, she said, "Dad, I've never seen it -- it's total love."
Which daughter?
I don't get love from the media. Instead of reporting like it is. But I think that people are starting to see what's going on, because I really believe there's a movement going on and it's a movement based on common sense, it's a movement based on law and order, it's a movement based on compassion, based on a lot of different things. Based on trade.
This is an America First day you are having out there.
Yeah.
We talked about that a little bit at the last conversation. Does America First take on a different meaning for you now? Think about its historical roots.
To me, America First is a brand-new modern term. I never related it to the past.
So it's not what Lindbergh had in mind?
It's just, no. In fact when I said America First, people said, "Oh, wait a minute, isn't that a historical term?" And when they told me, I said: "Look, it's America First. This is not -- -- -"
You were familiar with the history of the phrase.
I was familiar, but it wasn't used for that reason. It was used as a brand-new, very modern term.
What does it mean to you?
Meaning we are going to take care of this country first before we worry about everybody else in the world.
I know you were
No, the media's been very dishonest, but we put up with it. But I let people know about it. There's tremendous dishonesty in the media. But I let people know about it.
It's been a mixed blessing for you -- you wouldn't be where you are today without the media.
I think you're right. Yeah. I think you're right.
How did that work?
And by the way, some are tremendously honest, but you have tremendous dishonesty in the media, tremendous. I've never seen anything like it, more so in the last number of months, I think, than I've ever seen it. With that being said, you have to power through it, and I do that. And it seems to be working out pretty well. But I do like to expose it.
When you talk about exposing the media, what the media is there to do, what we are supposed to do, is keep you honest.
Yeah.
And you've had your share of misstatements over the past few months. Without the media, who would know about that?
Well, I think that I'm an honest person. I feel I'm an honest person. And I don't mind being criticized at all by the media, but I do wanna -- you know, I do want them to be straight about it.
The ex-presidents, the leaders of the party, the ones who ran for president, are pretty much arrayed against you.
Oh, I don't think so.
Now, you have to -- well, I mean, the Bushes are, the McCains are, the Romneys are...
I don't think so. Look, Ted, let me explain something: The people like me. I got the most votes, almost 14 million votes, in the history of the Republican Party. We're talking about Dwight D. Eisenhower --
That's Republican (voters).
We're talking about, no, well, the polls, the polls are showing it.
Now you've got to convince the Independents. Now you've got to convince some of the Democrats...
But I'm way up with Independents.
How do you convince the doubters? How do you convince the people who are sitting out there -- and there are a lot of people sitting out there -- saying, 'I can't believe that Donald J. Trump is the nominee'?
Well, my whole life, though -- and you've, you know, covered me for a long time, we've known each other a long time -- my whole life has been winning. I mean, I've won, you know, whether I did The Apprentice went on television --
OK, you can't compare anything you've done before.
I'm not saying that. I'm saying it's victory, though, a tremendous success in business, tremendous success with -- I go into television, I do a show, it's a big success. I write books, they're very successful.
There's nothing like running for President of the United States
No, I agree, for anybody, for anybody. I agree, I agree. There's nothing like it.
How do you convince those doubters? How do you convince the folks that you're gonna have to -- you're gonna have to get those people in the middle?
I think on November 8th, I think that's the way you convince 'em, to be honest with you. It's all about that; that's the only thing.
If you haven't convinced 'em before November 8th, you're in trouble.
No, but, no, right now I'm convincing them, Ted. Right now I'm up in many of the polls, and we're doing very well.
What are you doing? What are you saying? I mean, you talked at one point -- in fact, I heard you say it several times, 'Oh, I can be so presidential.'
It's true!
Haven't seen it yet.
I think you have. I think you have.
Well, I mean, I still see that flare of temper. I still see that Donald Trump who likes to jab people in the ribs when he feels he has to. Are we gonna see more of that or less? I mean, you're going after Hillary, there's no question of that, is there?
Well, I mean, she's a competitor just like -- when I'm, you know, running the nation, if that happens --
But is it gonna get nasty?
We're gonna compete -- with Hillary? Well, I mean, she's taken very nasty ads and all. I mean, it's not like me -- sort of funny that you say I'm going after her. She spent $102 million on negative ads, and you know, everyone says, 'Oh, you're going after Hillary.' She spent $102 million on negative ads. I haven't literally bought an ad. I will. We have a lot of money.
What is it that's going to be different about the Trump campaign now that you're in a general campaign?
Ted, all I can do is talk about policy, which I'm very good at. All I can do is talk about the things we're going to do for our country: rebuild our depleted military, borders, trade. Obamacare is a disaster, it's a total disaster. Our healthcare plan is a total disaster.
How important are the debates gonna be?
I think they'll be very important. I always think they're less important than people think. But you know, in the other debates -- I was in 11 debates -- every poll had me winning every single debate. Every single poll had me winning every single debate. I mean, I look forward to the debates.
You know what William F. Buckley said? He said, 'Never debate someone who's not a debater.' You're not a debater.
It could very well be. I think I surprised a lot of people. But I enjoyed the debates. My biggest question when I got into this is, what's gonna happen with the debates, 'cause I'd never debated professionally before. You know, my whole life is a debate in a way. But you know, to go on a stage and -- I went on against people, that's all they do is debate -- you know, they're politicians. And I actually loved debating. I enjoyed it.
Well, it allows you to circumvent the media.
It allows me to get across a point very quickly in seconds. I mean, there was never anything like that. And I have such a big base. It's such a big -- you know, 20 million people, it's such a tremend -- it's more than that. It's gonna be much more. I think I'm gaining probably 100,000 people every few days. And that gives me a big, big base in terms of a campaign. In terms of a presidency, I don't think I'd use it very much at all.
Mr. Trump, welcome back to Meet the Press.
Thank you.
First of all, congratulations, Republican nominee, that's a big title, that close to the presidency. How's it feel?
Well, it really feels great. And we really have a very unified party, other than a very small group of people that, frankly, lost. And we have a very unified party. You saw that the other night with the love in the room, and the enthusiasm in the room. The enthusiasm, there are people that say they have never seen anything like what was going on in that room, especially Thursday night.
Let me tell you, you bring up Thursday night, I've got to ask you about your entrance. Before we get to Thursday, that Monday night entrance was something else. I know you've gotten a lot of feedback on it.
I think I'm a little bit lucky, and a couple of people had that idea and I went along with the idea. And everything just worked right. And it was so good that they wanted to do it on Thursday night. I said, "Never in a million years, because you'll never get it that way again."
I don't think I've seen that even on WWE.
Yeah, I know. Well, Vincent's a good friend of mine. He called me, he said, "That was a very, very good entrance." But I didn't want to do it a second time, because, you know, it never works out the second time.
All right, let's go into the speech. I want to put some meat on the bones. But first, let's talk about, you've seen some of the positive reviews, some of the negative reviews. Some of the negative has been that it was a little dark --
That's the only thing that --
-- that there wasn't enough optimism in it. What would you say? It's not Morning in America.
Yeah.
Do you think it was a little dark?
No, oh, I thought it was very optimistic. To me, it was an optimistic speech, because --
What makes it optimistic in your view?
Because we're going to stop the problems. We're going to stop the problems. In other words, sure, I talk about the problems, but we're going to solve the problems. I --
You bring that up, I want to get into the meat of the speech. And I was going to do this later, but you just brought up the plants. You said there would be consequences for any company that tried to move a factory out. What --
Absolutely, those --
Right, I understand that. But explain the consequences --
OK, here's the consequence --
What kind of tax are you thinking?
It could be 25%. It could be 35%. It could be 15%. I haven't determined. And it could be different for different companies. We have been working on trying to stop this government, because we don't know what we're doing. And not only Obama, they've been trying to stop this from before Obama. But they don't know. You know, they've done, they've tried lower interest loans, they've tried zero interest loans, these guys --
Well, some of these things aren't going to get through the World Trade Organization. There's --
Even better. Then we're going to renegotiate or we're going to pull out. These trade deals are a disaster, Chuck. You know, the World Trade Organization is a disaster.
You know the concern --
NAFTA is a disaster --
Now you --
The stock market's higher now than it was when it happened. And by the way, I'm the only one of all of these people at the higher level of the wonderful world of politics, I'm the only one that said, "Brexit's going to happen." Remember, I was asked the question. I said, "Yeah, I think they're going to approve it. I think they want independence. I don't think they want people pouring into their country." And I was --
You're not worried about, you think a fractured Europe is good for America?
No, no. But we're spending a lot of money in Europe. Don't forget, Europe got together, why, primarily did they get together? So that they could beat the United States when it comes to making money, in other words, foreign trade --
Economic --
OK? And now we talk about Europe like it's so wonderful. Hey, I love Europe, I have property in Europe. I'm just saying, the reason that it got together was like a consortium so that it could compete with the United States --
So what you're saying is all this stuff is good for America, even though it's not good for Europe?
Look, you take a look at Airbus. They make more planes now than Boeing, OK? They got together, all of these countries got together so that they could beat the United States. OK, so we're in competition. So you know, we're in competition in one way, we're helping them in another way. It is so messed up. I'm only saying this: If a company moves and leaves Indiana or leaves Michigan, let's say Ford leaves Michigan and builds a massive plant, like my friend, he's going to build it --
Any car that comes from that plant, you're going to tax it --
If they want to fire all their people in Michigan and they don't want to build in Michigan, what I'm going to do is I'm going to say, "Welcome to Mexico, enjoy your plant. But when you make a car and it comes back into the United States, we're going to charge you a tax." And you know what that's going to do? They're not going to leave Michigan.
All right, let me move on. The Muslim ban. I think you've pulled back from it, but you tell me. You said, "Lastly, and very importantly, " this was in your speech on Thursday night, "We must immediately suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time it's proven that vetting mechanisms have been put in place." This feels like a slight rollback --
I don't think that's --
I was just going to ask that. With the limit --
You know, so it's not just the countries with --
-- would this limit immigration from France?
What we're going to have is a thing called --
They've been compromised by terrorism.
They have totally been. And you know why? It's their own fault. Because they allowed people to come into their territory --
So you would toughen up. You're basically saying, "Hey, if the French want to come over here, you've got to go through an extra check."
It's their own fault, because they've allowed people over years to come into their territory. And that's why Brexit happened, OK? Because the U.K. is saying, "We're tired of this stuff, what's going on, we're tired of." But listen to this --
So France, Germany, Spain --
Here's my plan --
-- places that have been compromised?
-- here is what I want: Extreme vetting. Tough word. Extreme vetting.
What does that --
We have to have tough, we're going to have tough standards. And if a person can't prove --
Give me one.
-- that they're from an area, and if a person can't prove what they have to be able to prove, they're not coming into this country. And I would stop the Syrian migration and a Syrian from coming into this country in two seconds. Hillary Clinton wants to take 550% more people coming in from that area than Barack Obama. I think she's crazy. I think she's crazy. We have no idea who these people are for the most part, and you know, because you've seen them on different shows --
All right.
-- but more importantly, I've read about it. I study it. There is no way that you can vet some of these people. There is no way. Law enforcement officials, I've had them in my office. I've talked to them.
You realize some of these folks have nowhere to go? They're truly victims of this civil war, what do you do with them --
We will help them and we will build safe havens over in Syria, and we will get Gulf States --
We, the United States are going to build safe havens --
We, the United States, we'll get Gulf States to pay for it, because we right now, we're going to have $21 trillion very soon, trillion, in debt. We will do safe havens and safe zones in Syria and we will get nations that are so wealthy that are not doing anything. They're not doing much. They have nothing but money. And you know who I'm talking about, the Gulf States. And we will get them to pay for it. We will do it. I don't want to pay because our country is going down the tubes. We owe too much money.
All right. Let me move to something with NATO. Mitch McConnell said this about your NATO remarks in the New York Times. He said it was a rookie mistake, and that once you, let me finish the comment here. So, "Rookie mistake, and it proves that Trump needs people like us around to help steer him in the right direction on some basic things."
He's 100% wrong. OK? He's 100% wrong if he said that. I didn't hear he said that --
He did say it.
OK, fine, fine --
-- and if they get invaded by Russia, you're there?
I feel differently. I feel very differently --
I don't want to get in trouble --
Just, and by the way, don't worry about getting in trouble --
To speed things up I'm just going to literally throw out a name and you'll know the question I'm asking. Bernie Sanders.
Great respect for what he's done. He is being taken advantage of, and frankly, the system was rigged, and I'm the first one to say it was rigged against him. And by the way --
You took after him. You took after him. You said for supporting Hillary Clinton, you think he needs to --
Well, I'm not a fan of Bernie Sanders. But I am a fan of one thing that he talks about: Trade. He is the only one on that side that understands trade. Now, he can't do anything about it because that's not his thing. But he has been gamed. He has been, it's a rigged system against him. And what happened with the choice of Tim Kaine was a slap in the face to Bernie Sanders and everybody. I was shocked. I love it from my standpoint, I love --
Well, they proved to quid pro quo --
-- for taking a fraction of what --
All right. Ted Cruz, I'm going to amend it, are you really going to fund a super PAC to help defeat him --
Well, it's not the number one thing on my mind. Look, what's on my mind is beating Hillary Clinton. What's on my mind is winning for the Republican Party. With that being said, yeah, I'll probably do a super PAC, you know, when they run against Kasich, for $10 million to $20 million, against Ted Cruz. And maybe one other person that I'm thinking about --
Just one other person --
-- but I won't say it. I mean, he's actually such a small person, I hate to give him the publicity. But yes, I will probably do that at the appropriate at time. But I'm not going to do that until --
Oh, give me the small person here.
No, no, don't worry about it. We'll give it to you another time.
All right, let me ask you about this one. David Duke announced his Senate candidacy claiming your agenda for his own, or essentially saying, "Glad that you spoke out."
Are you ready, before you ask the question?
Make people look --
Let me tell you. Let me give you a little lesson on tax returns. First of all, you don't learn very much on a tax return. I put in to the federal elections group 100 and some-odd pages of my financials. It showed, as you know, that I'm much wealthier than anybody even understood, OK? Tremendous cash, tremendous assets, tremendous all that stuff. OK, that's it. I'm going through a routine audit. Just a routine audit, and I've had it for I think 14 years, 13 years --
So you still might release them --
Wait a minute, wait a minute. When he did, and his tax returns are a tiny peanut compared to mine, they went through his tax returns. And they found one little sentence, another, there was nothing wrong. And they made him look bad. In fact I think he lost his election because of that.
Because of the tax returns.
I think he lost. And I'll tell you why: He didn't do anything wrong. Mitt Romney did nothing wrong. But they would take out of, his were too big. Have you ever seen mine with the picture, they're like this high?
I have seen that.
OK, so they took his tax return and they found a couple of little things. Nothing wrong, just standard. And they made him look very bad, very unfair. But with all that said, I'd love to give them, but I'm under audit. When the audit's finished I'll give them.
Yes, what's --
My campaign's doing pretty well.
Mr. Trump, until we meet again.
Thank you very much --
Yes. I mean, the numbers aren't good. But it's an interesting argument because it's speculative and you can't deny how bad it was with Lehman Brothers folding and all of that and a lot of panic. But on the other hand, you know, eight years is eight years. And I tend to agree that the economy should be better than it is now. What about the minimum wage? You got hammered on that by Bernie Sanders last night. What's your vision for federal minimum wage? How much?
Well, he lied last night. I mean, it was a total lie, and everybody said it, in fact, some of the folks on your network said, wow, that was really a lie, he said that I want to do go less than minimum wage. This is the new one. Because I'm the Republican that said in some cases we have to go more than minimum wage.
But give me a number. Give me a number.
No. Let me give you a concept because I think it's a good concept. You go with the states. Let the states make the determination. Because if you take New York, it's very expensive to live in New York. And they need more than, you know, even, eight, nine dollars, so you go with the states.
But the states have the authority now to do that.
They do. They do.
There has to be a federal minimum wage.
They do. They do.
What would you set the federal minimum wage at?
There doesn't have to be. Well, I would leave it and raise it somewhat. You need to help people. And I know it's not very Republican to say.
Well, give me 10 bucks?
I would say 10. I would say 10.
All right.
But, with the understanding that somebody like me is going to bring back jobs, I don't want people to be in that $10 category for very long. But, the thing is, Bill, let the states make the deal.
Yes. But they do have the right to do that now. Because you could have a state that raises it to 15 and I would also, and this is just an aside, teenagers could make a little bit less, you know, first job if you are 17, you know, to get them in the workforce. But anyway, let's go on to --
Well, let me just finish because a friend of mine is a very tremendous employer. And what he did is he said by raising it and by doing certain things it took the incentive. He pays people incentive basis, if they are really good, he gives them incentive. Nobody has ever heard of this before but a lot of companies do it.
Yes. I know but --
And he said, by raising it they already get the incentive. No, I believe it should be raised but when Bernie Sanders said that I want to go less than what the minimum wage, I mean, honestly, Bill, these people are lying so much.
All right. OK.
And every fact checker said Trump never said that. I never did say it.
Yes. And they can if they want. Climate change, they said that you called climate change a hoax. Is that true?
I want clean air and I want clean water. And if you look at what's going on in China and all of these other countries that talk and they laugh behind our back at what we're doing, we want clean air, clean water, I have gotten many environmental awards. Believe me, I know what I'm talking about. But I want -- we have to have crystal clear water and crystal clean air.
OK. But did you ever call climate change a hoax?
Well, I might have because when I look at some of the things that are going on, in fact, if you look at Europe where they had their big summit a couple of years ago, where people were sending out emails, scientists practically calling it a hoax and they were laughing at it. So, yes, I probably did. I see what's going on and you see what's going on.
Do you believe that that manmade fossil fuels and gases have eroded the environment so that the sun is more intense on earth? Because that's the basic thing? Do you believe that's happening?
Well, they are saying man made and I say it could have a minor impact but nothing, nothing to what they're talking about.
All right.
And what it's doing is putting us at a tremendous disadvantage as a country. Because other countries are not adhering to the rules. We are. And it makes it impossible for our business to compete.
That's true.
We are adhering to these very strict rules. And you look at China and you look at all of these other countries practically all of them they are not adhering to the rules. And our jobs are being jeopardized -- and not being jeopardized, they are being taken away. Our companies are unable to compete.
All right. NATO, you made some controversial comments. I just want you to clarify them because I hate taking it from the press, because I agree with you that you are not going to get a fair shot in the press ever. So, you got small countries in Eastern Europe that Putin might mess around with. That would trigger a response from the United States. And you kind of seem to indicate that maybe you wouldn't respond.
Well, I think I have been treated fairly, you know, reasonably on that. And the New York Times covered it fairly accurately, which is unusual for them because usually they don't. The fact is we are protecting so many countries that are not paying for the protection. They are not living up to the bargain. They are not living up to their agreement. We have an agreement. We're going to protect countries. And I like NATO. I like the concept of NATO. But it's obsolete because we don't cover terrorism. And I have been saying that for a while and now all of a sudden because I have been saying it, they have a division where they start really covering terrorism.
Yes. They started division. But I think that was because of me not you.
Well, wait a minute, Bill.
Got to kick them out.
We are funding 73 percent of the cost of NATO. So we're protecting all of these countries. They have an agreement to reimburse us and pay us and they are not doing it and if they are not going to do that. We have to seriously rethink at least those countries. It's very unfair. Right now, you have five countries that are paying their share. Five.
OK. I agree if they're not paying their share then they get booted out of the alliance and that's it --
And you know, Bill -- and you know what's been happening, people are saying well, we have a treaty. Well, we do have a treaty. We have a treaty both ways. They are supposed to be paying. They are not paying. And the reason they are not paying is because we are not asking for the money. And we are not -- this isn't 40 years ago or 50 years ago where we can, you know, do whatever we want to do. We owe $19 trillion. Going to be 21 trillion very soon because of the horrible budget that was just made. We owe $19 trillion. And we are paying for all of these countries. They are not living up to their obligation.
Right.
And then we are supposed to get into world war 3. Now, let me just tell you, a lot of people first they really didn't like what I was saying. Now so many people are starting to agree with me, they are saying you know what? Trump was right.
I think they have to pay.
And you watch. You watch. Hillary Clinton will now come out and say countries have to pay and people are going to forget it just like she did today.
I don't know if she'd done that.
NAFTA. Just like today, she came out today with NAFTA. I have been saying, he would have to renegotiate with NAFTA or we have to get out because they are taking our jobs. Today for the first time out of all these years that she's worked on this and her husband signed it and one of the worst things ever signed from an economic development standpoint, she came out today and said, well we are going to have to start thinking about renegotiating our deals. I have been saying this for a long time. She just came out. And you know why? Because what I have been saying makes sense to a lot of people.
There's another reason it's a sop to Bernie Sanders, and that brings me my last question. Have you ever spoken to Bernie Sanders? Have you ever talked to him?
No, I haven't.
Ever in your life talked to him?
He is a tired man. He is exhausted. I think, frankly, in terms of his legacy. He wants to go home.
He's not much older than you though. There is only maybe two or three years --
Well, he is quite a bit older. But he wants to go home and he wants to go to bed. You know, honestly --
How do you know he wants to go to bed? He is exhausted.
You know what, for his legacy --
Yes.
He would have been better off playing it out. He is exhausted. He wants to go home and go to bed. But a lot of the Bernie Sanders people are going to come to me, you know why? Because I'm the best there is on trade. And I'm going to make new trade deals and we're going to bring our jobs back to our country.
So, you're not taking it personally?
I guess, I take it a little bit personally, but you can't let it get you down. You have to go out --
When you look at Vladimir Putin, you said he's a great leader of his country, but he's also a guy that --
No, I didn't say that, I said he's a better leader than Obama.
Right --
Not a bad thing. We don't get along with Russia. We practically don't get along with too many.
But you -- we have a criteria to be friends with so many. So bigger than maybe Ukraine, if they're going to buzz our ships that they're doing right now, and --
You know why? You know why they do that because they have no respect for our leader. That's why they do it --
Yes, they did it --
They have no respect --
If they showed no respect for --
I don't think they'd be doing that. I don't think they'd be doing that for one minute.
Because?
Because I think they respect me.
Because you --
They don't respect President Obama.
Lastly, personal question. How hard was it if at all as a parent to watch your kids --
I was so proud of my kids and my family, the way they got up at that unbelievable moment and made these incredible speeches.
You don't get choked up with something like that --
Well, I don't know --
Yes --
They're tired of working harder than they did 18 years ago and making less money. It's an incredible, beautiful movement. We're going to make America great again and we're going to make America safe again.
Donald, thank you very much for joining us.
Thank you very much, Greta.
A couple million, it's true.
Three.
She quoted Jackie Kennedy suggesting you're a little man moved by fear and pride.
She's a very dishonest person. I have one of the great temperaments. I have a winning temperament. She has a bad temperament. She's weak. We need a strong temperament and that's all it is, I have a strong temperament. And...
But there are...
-- I do know how to win.
Well, he was in Moscow...
-- and I was shot in New York.
-- you were in New York. But that's the thing.
No, just so you understand, he said very nice things about me, but I have no relationship with him. I don't -- I've never met him.
Yet you said for three years, '13, '14 and '15, that you did have a relationship with him.
No, look, what -- what do you call a relationship? I mean he treats me...
I'm asking you.
-- with great respect. I have no relationship with Putin. I don't think I've ever met him. I never met him. I don't think I've ever met him.
You would know if you did.
I think so.
I mean if he...
Yes, I think so. So I've -- I don't think I've ever met him. I mean if he's in the same room or something. But I don't think so.
But a -- I just want to clear this up, because you did say on three different occasions you had a relationship with him. Now you say there is not.
Well, I don't know what it means by having a relationship. I mean he was saying very good things about me, but I don't have a relationship with him. I didn't meet him. I haven't spent time with him. I didn't have dinner with him. I didn't go hiking with him. I don't know -- and I wouldn't know him from Adam except I see his picture and I would know what he looks like.
Why did you soften the GOP platform on Ukraine?
I wasn't involved in that. Honestly, I was not involved.
Your people were.
Yes. I was not involved in that. I'd like to -- I'd have to take a look at it. But I was not involved in that.
Do you know what they did?
They softened it, I heard, but I was not involved.
Well, he's already there, isn't he?
OK, well, he's there in a certain way, but I'm not there yet. You have Obama there. And frankly, that whole part of the world is a mess under Obama, with all the strength that you're talking about and all of the power of NATO and all of this, in the meantime, he's going where -- he takes -- takes Crimea, he's sort of -- I mean...
You partner now with...
Now, well I sell...
No debts?
No debts. I have very little debt to anybody. I don't need debt. You know, it's very interesting, I'm so liquid, I don't need debt. And if I need debt, if I want debt, I can get it from banks in New York City very easily.
I've been audited.
-- who are very wealthy that never have been audited. I say -- you get audited. I get audited every year. I'm under a routine audited like routine. And I've been for years, every year.
Richard Nixon released his even though his were under audit.
I don't use Richard Nixon as necessarily the guide, OK. I mean, you know, it's an interesting person to use, but don't use it.
Here's what he hit you on in the speech....
And I hit the ball a lot longer, and a lot better.
He hit you for hypocrisy in the speech. For selling products overseas, gaming the visa system to hire foreign works at low wages. And just this week BuzzFeed reported that Mar-a-Lago is putting out application for 78 more visas for foreign workers even though...
Should I tell you about it? Mara-a-Lago is a very successful club in Palm Beach, Florida, the Mar-a-Lago club, and during the season, it's very, very hard to get employees.
Here are numbers of hiring of foreign workers. Since 2010, 300 U.S. applicants in Mar-a-Lago, 17 hired, more than 500 visa applications.
Well, you know what? I don't hire the people. But if you look at all the other places in Palm Beach, they're all doing exactly the same thing. And you know why they're doing that? You know why they're doing that? Because you can't get people, George.
What do you think a voter thinks when they hear you say I can't find American workers. I can't find American workers.
I think the voter understand it, because they understand that -- you know, you're not reinventing the wheel here with these questions. These get asked all the time. I've been asked about Mar-a-Lago. I have many other places where I don't have to do that, because you have a normal season.
He said you have sacrificed nothing and no one.
Well, that sounds -- who wrote that? Did Hillary's script writer write it? Because everybody that went out there -- we also had John Allen, who failed with ISIS. I mean, he was a general -- General Allen -- he went out, and he's ranting and raving. And then I read a report. He was in there for a number of months, and he failed with ISIS. And he's telling me, you know.
How would you answer that father? What sacrifice have you made for your country?
I think I have made a lot of sacrifices. I've work very, very hard. I've created thousands and thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs, built great structures. I've done -- I've had tremendous success.
Mr. Trump, thanks for your time.
Thank you very much.
Mr. Trump, good to see you, sir.
Thank you, Sean.
What...
I don't know what it means, but I think it's a good sign.
So where -- so...
So it's really bad.
So...
I flew over Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and you look at all the empty factories from years gone by, where they used to be just flourishing. And now it's -- they're all gone.
And you were also against...
... been in the war, so a...
Let me ask you this...
... they'd be fighting each other and moving nowhere.
Yes.
... that was very simple.
Let me ask this.
Now, as far as Crimea -- as far as Crimea, though, they've been there for two years. That's already -- I guess you could say that's basically gone, at least right now.
You know, it's interesting, a friend of mine sent me this and he Googled Pat Smith and Benghazi on -- on Google, 384,000...
Yes.
Let me ask one other thing on this...
The Washington Post has been very tough, although I must say, The Washington Post has been getting better.
What...
They -- well, they did.
Respond to this stuff.
That was shocking.
Six thousand eight hundred seventy-seven Syrian refugees have arrived through July 31st. Of the 6,877, 6,834 happen to be either Sunni, Shia or generic Muslim. And yet we have genocide against Christians in Syria and elsewhere.
Yes.
Are we, then, therefore, discriminating...
Well, we don't...
All right, we've got to...
But I will say, if you're Christian, it -- if you're Christian, it was very, very hard to get into this country.
Now, The Washington Post, not a friend of yours, I don't think, by any stretch, they gave four Pinocchios, and although Comey did say many emails were retroactively classified, he also said there were some emails that were already classified that should not have been sent on an unclassified private server. That's the uncomfortable truth that Clinton has trouble admitting. She lied -- she lied to the parents...
Well, she lied...
... according to Pat Smith.
I mean...
She lies a lot.
Yes.
Well, let me ask you about them...
... in Mexico and other places.
... because we have new information...
And she's lying about that. She's not going to do anything about it.
Well, we now have the lowest home ownership rate in 51 years now in America...
Yes.
... the worst recovery now...
Big numbers.
... since the 1940s, the lowest labor participation rate...
Right.
But I think the...
I'm lowering taxes.
The...
Right now, we're the highest taxed nation in the world. We're going to lower taxes under my plan, and Larry Kudlow and so many others love it.
Well, I...
We're going to lower taxes very, very substantially.
The repatriated money, which is trillions, that -- and I think, becoming energy independent...
Yes.
... alone would create millions of jobs. Let me ask you, though -- I want to ask you about last week.
Two and a half trillion dollars.
Yes.
... something about it and make great deals. But on trade, he understands that this country is getting ripped off. Our jobs are being taken away.
Let me...
That's an important thing.
Last -- last question...
... you know, you hear all these platitudes, it's -- it's ridiculous -- for the other one. Go ahead.
Absolutely.
... it was...
Well, we know it was rigged now.
... you know, the guy never had a chance.
We have the emails.
And -- and I'm telling you, November 8th, we'd better be careful, because that election is going to be rigged. And I hope the Republicans are watching closely, or it's going to be taken away from us.
All right, Mr. Trump, thank you so much for being with us. We appreciate it.
Thank you.
So how are you feeling about the campaign?
I think really good. I think, uh --
'Cause there are a couple of polls that came out showing Hillary got a big bounce --
Yeah, she got a bounce --
-- after her convention.
Well, she got the second. You have the advantage being the second convention. It's a big advantage being the second convention. But I feel good. You see the crowds. I mean, you don't see enthusiasm like that at a Hillary rally. People are falling asleep.
Did you see Tim Kaine's speech?
I thought it, yeah --
He tried to impersonate you.
Yeah, I thought he was terrible. I thought his speech was terrible. Although he's not popular here. You know, this is Loudoun County. Loudoun County's a big deal.
Whoever wins Loudoun wins the election.
Is that what you think?
(Hillary Clinton is) trying to be the changemaker now. We heard Bill Clinton: She's the biggest changemaker he's ever met in his life.
She's been there for 30 years. She's not going to change. Because you look at her donors. So you heard my speech?
Mhm.
How did you like it?
They are. You think she should leave and go find another --
You can do it either way.
Would you want her to follow the path that Gretchen Carlson did?
I'd want her to do what makes her happy. I'd want her to do, Phil, what makes her happy. (Trump looks at a nearby television, which was tuned to Fox News.) Oh, did they have another one of these things go down? It's terrible that crash. Never liked that plane, structurally. I never thought that plane could --
Why should she have to change careers or jobs?
She doesn't have to. She can do it either way. Some people would rather change and some people don't. Some people don't want to be forced to stay in a certain atmosphere. You can do both.
What do you mean?
You can go through the process. You can also change. You can do both. Uh, you can do one, the other, or both. And I think it depends on the individual. You understand what I mean by that, right?
Yeah.
One, the other or both.
And is there one that's preferable, in your mind?
I think it's gotta be up to the individual. I think it depends on the individual. It also depends on what's available. There may be a better alternative, then there may not. If there's not a better alternative, then you stay. But it could be there's a better alternative where you're taken care of better. But some people don't like staying in an atmosphere that was so hostile. You understand that?
Rather just stay there.
But you can do one, you can do the other, or you can do both -- meaning fight it out but be in a place that's more comfortable.
Leave and work someplace else while you fight it out.
Correct.
What if --
Well, you're right. But if she's being harassed, would you want to stay in a place that she's being harassed in?
Yeah. And that's what you meant by that?
Absolutely. I think a lot of women wouldn't want to stay in a place where they're being harassed.
Can we talk about the debates for a minute?
Sure.
So, master negotiator, how would you negotiate these debates? What --
Well, I think -- first of all --
-- kind of debate do you want?
I've been very successful at negotiating debates because if you remember when we had to negotiate, I negotiated the proper timing and other things having to do with one of our other debates, OK? You --
Primary debates.
That was me. I don't -- I think three debates is the right number. I think that, uh, they'll be extremely well watched. There are those who will say it will be one of the highest-rated shows in television history, if not the highest.
They're probably right about that.
No, they're thinking -- you know, I've heard that a long time ago. I've heard -- when I first started, people were saying, "You know if it ends up being Trump against Clinton, it's going to be the highest-rated debate in the history of television -- or, show in the history of television. And they also said something else. It'll probably be the greatest voter turnout in the history of this country. That could very well be.
What would you negotiate for? Do you want for example Gary Johnson and Jill Stein?
No because they're not getting any... I'd rather have head to head and right now they're not getting any numbers. She's doing better than he is, but right now in some polls she's actually not doing badly.
There were some Jill Stein supporters in Philadelphia.
She doesn't get media coverage only because people perceive her as hurting Hillary Clinton. I'm not sure that that's true.
I don't know about that.
People perceive her as hurting Clinton. I think she's doing very well. I don't think the numbers will be good enough for them to be in the debate.
Have you identified dates when you want it to be? You took issue with it being near the NFL.
I don't think they should be against the NFL because the NFL, those are two big games. I don't think it would be good for the NFL and I don't think it would be good for the debates.
You have the World Series. There are other events.
There are plenty of dates that are dead nights that you could do. There are plenty evenings that are dead nights that you could have the debates in.
Who do you want to be a moderator?
Well, I'd want to play a role in that. I'd want to have a fair moderator. I thought that Mitt Romney was treated very unfairly in the third debate (in 2012).
You mean Candy Crowley?
I thought it was very unfair. I thought what happened to Mitt Romney was very unfair in the third debate. So, I'd want to be. I'd want to have somebody that I think could be fair. But I think three debates is good. I think it should be on a night where viewers are going to be able to watch. I wouldn't be surprised if Hillary's people had something to do with putting them on these evenings because that's what she did to Bernie Sanders. In all fairness, even if. September, she was always going to be the Democratic nominee so there was no negotiating even back then. You know this was before.... She was always expected to win the Democratic nomination so I wouldn't be surprised if they picked those evenings...
You said yesterday that you worried the election might be rigged in some way.
Yeah.
What is your worry exactly?
I don't like what's going on with voter ID.
It would be what's happening in the states?
Well, I think it's ridiculous. I mean the voter ID situation has turned out to be a very unfair development. We may have people vote 10 times. It's inconceivable that you don't have to show identification in order to vote or that that the identification doesn't have to be somewhat foolproof.
Although, there's a tradition in this country of when somebody loses an election, they concede graciously and try to get their supporters on board like Al Gore did in 2000. Would you? You know if some reason Hillary were to win narrowly, would you contest that in some way?
I don't want to jump the gun. I don't want to talk about that. I'm just saying that I wouldn't be surprised if the election... there's a lot of dirty pool played at the election, meaning the election is rigged. I would not be surprised. The voter ID, they're fighting as hard as you can fight so that that they don't have to show voter ID. So, what's the purpose of that? How many times is a person going to vote during the day? If you don't have voter ID...
Do you think someone can vote multiple times?
Multiple times. How about like 10 times. Why not? If you don't have voter ID, you can just keep voting and voting and voting.
Is there anything else that you think could be going on?
Look, you never know. It started with me in Louisiana when I won Louisiana and I got fewer delegates than Ted Cruz.
I remember that.
I said, "Whoa! Whoa! What happens here?" And then I polled well in Colorado. and instead of voting, the bosses picked it. I said, "What's going on here?" It took me a little while to get accustomed to the world of politics and then once I did we started running them off. But, who would've thought that was going to happen? I win a state, I get fewer votes. Then, I poll great in Colorado and all of a sudden... the voters aren't going to choose. The bosses are going to choose. Anything is possible.
I have to ask you because this has been the story now for four days: the Khan family. I've seen the statements you've put out and what you had to say last night on Fox News. First of all, does it bother you that they continue to do interviews and sort of drive the --
Just unfair media. Just the unfair media. It's purely and simply the unfair media.
What do you mean by that?
They want the story to stay alive as long as possible.
Do you think they're somehow trying to, the Khan family, are they on TV to try to help Hillary?
People have to form their own opinion. I've said everything I can say about it. I was viciously attacked from the stage, and I have a right to answer back. I've said everything I could say. I was viciously attacked on the stage, and I have a right to answer back. That's all I have to say about it.
Do you understand why some people would say that you lack some sort of common decency?
I think frankly a lot of people agree with what I'm saying. I was viciously attacked on the stage. All I did was respond to it. Pure and simple. It should've been a one-hour story and they make it a longer story.
It's a four-day story.
I mean fine. So, I have no further thing to say other than I have a right to answer back.
Now that the conventions are over and we're moving into the general election, you've been going after the media more than you have been before. Do you sense any actual shift in the way you're being covered in this phase of the campaign?
Yeah. It's getting worse.
In television in particular...
It's worse now because before I had 16 Republican, conservative people and the media had their favorite but they didn't particularly love anybody. Now it's myself really against the media.
What do you mean by that?
The media has a tremendous bias and has for a very long time against the Republican party and against somebody that happens to be conservative. They certainly have a tremendous bias against me. Everyone's talking about it. Worldwide, they're talking about the bias. When you look at the New York Times, when you look at The Washington Post, when you look at CNN. I mean CNN is all Trump all the time. It's called the Clinton News Network. Every story is Trump. All day long no matter what it is.
You are the biggest story in the world.
No, I get ratings. If I didn't get ratings, they wouldn't do it. They don't care about poll numbers, they only care about ratings. And, I get ratings but I don't do interviews for those people anymore. I don't watch CNN anymore. I don't do interviews with CNN anymore because its not worth it. It's very biased against me.
What's your plan then if you don't engage with the media that you think are biased against you? How do you get your message out and communicate to people?
What I did today.
How has (running mate Mike) Pence been doing?
Pence has been great. You know Kaine, in Virginia where I am right now, you know he wasn't popular?
Well, he got elected several times to different jobs.
No but they're very close, ever notice? They're very close elections. He even said they were very close. But his first move as governor of Virginia was to raise taxes by 4 billion dollars. He was not popular in Virginia. He wasn't popular. (Trump looks up at the television) Do you believe that Debbie Schultz, Wasserman Schultz, there she is. She's very happy -- look how happy she looks. She looks very happy.
Oh, well, she's got a job on the campaign now.
Payback.
She also has a primary challenge that comes from the Bernie people.
I think she's gonna lose.
You think so?
Are you hearing that? She went to a rally and they were booing her.
Now do you believe definitively that you support Paul Ryan in his primary? Because that's something that blew up last night because you had a comment in support of his opponent in the primary.
I didn't support him. I just thanked him for sending their love.
Have you endorsed Paul Ryan?
His opponent sent me a nice letter and I merely thanked him.
Do you support Ryan?
Nobody has asked me if I support Ryan.
I'm asking now though.
I'm giving it very serious consideration.
To supporting Ryan?
Yeah.
It got interpreted a certain way though to suggest somehow that you're supporting him.
No. I'm giving it very serious consideration to that whole situation.
To Ryan.
To Ryan. To Paul.
Do you want to work with him? Do you think you can work with him if elected?
Oh, I think so.
Let's go back just a little bit to Pence. I'd love you to tell me what your relationship's like.
I think it's phenomenal.
How do you guys communicate during the day?
Beyond good. Beyond good.
Do you talk each day?
Oh, there look, can you believe that? Something, right?
Do you think he really gave you the Purple Heart?
Yeah, he did. He gave me the Purple Heart.
Did you think about not taking it? Like insisting that he keep it himself?
I did. I said you can't give me this. He said, "Mr. Trump you mean so much to me and my family." You know we're doing very well with the veterans. I know you guys do not like to say that.
Well, half the people in your rallies are veterans.
(Looks at the television again) Look at this. It's all Trump all day long. That's why their ratings are through the roof. I'd hate to say, Philip, if I wasn't running, the television networks would be doing less than half the business.
Yeah, please do.
OK, you're asking me if I'm supporting Paul Ryan?
Yeah, if you're supporting Paul Ryan.
I'm not quite there yet.
And why is that?
Just not quite there yet.
Has he asked for your support?
Everybody wants my support. You know why? Cause I had more than 14 million people that voted for me. And nobody gives us credit. There were 17 people in the race. I got more votes than anybody in the history of Republican politics. By millions. Don't forget. How about if I had two people in the race? The number would've been twice as good. In other words, people with 2 million people. Because the Republican party increased. (Trump looks at the TV.) That statement's gotten a lot of play. I love that statement we wrote. So I'm just not quite there yet.
So you're doing what Paul Ryan did to you, which is not endorse right away but sort of think about it for some time?
I like Paul. I like Paul. But these are horrible times for our country. We need very strong leadership. We need very, very strong leadership. And I'm just not quite there. I'm not quite there yet.
Now Mitch McConnell is not on the ballot this year but where are you in terms of him, should he be the leader of the Senate?
It's up to the Senate. Up to the senators.
Were you bothered at all by John McCain's statement yesterday? That was a pretty extraordinary statement.
Well, I haven't endorsed him, as you know.
Right.
I haven't endorsed John McCain. And I've never been there with John McCain because I've always felt that he should've done a much better job for the vets. He has not done a good job for the vets and I've always felt that he should've done a much better job for the vets. So I've always had, I've always had a difficult time with John for that reason. Because our vets are not being treated properly, they're not being treated fairly.
When you say you're not there with him.
I didn't say that, I said that about Ryan.
Is it a political mistake for some of these senators to be distancing themselves from you?
Well I think it is because --
Like Kelly Ayotte up in New Hampshire?
Look, in New Hampshire, I'm at --
Well you won the primary there --
By a lot. New Hampshire's one of my favorite places. You have a Kelly Ayotte, who doesn't want to talk about Trump, but I'm beating her in the polls by a lot. You tell me. Are these people that should be representing us? OK? You tell me. I don't know Kelly Ayotte. I know she's given me no support, zero support, and yet I'm leading her in the polls. And I'm doing very well in New Hampshire. We need loyal people in this country. We need fighters in this country. We don't need weak people. We have enough of them. We need fighters in this country. But Kelly Ayotte has given me zero support and I'm doing great in New Hampshire. You know, as you saw, I'm eight points up. I'm leading Hillary Clinton by eight points.
That word fighter, that was in the Democratic Convention every night, that was the big theme for Hillary, that she's been fighting her whole...
Hillary's not a fighter.
... life for children and families.
Hillary's not a fighter.
Why do you say that?
And Hillary's not a change person. She's gonna be a person to keep it just the way it is. It's gonna be four more years of (President) Obama.
So 98 days, 97 days now. Left in the campaign. How are you going to beat her? Explain the path here. What are the states you win? What are the kind of voters you're going to bring into your coalition?
I think I'm going to to do great in Ohio, we're going to do great in Pennsylvania, I think I'm going to do great in Florida and I think I'm going to do great in states that some people aren't even thinking about. Because I'm different than Republican candidates, than other Republican candidates. I've got states that we can win that other Republican candidates wouldn't even stop over for dinner.
Like what? Like Maine?
Well, I'd rather not say. Because why should I highlight it? But we have some states that I think are very competitive in that no Republican has ever been competitive in. But I'd rather not say what they are. Don't you agree with that? I'd rather not say what they are.
So you'll win with the secret state strategy?
No, not the secret state, no. But I have states, and you know this, I have states that no other Republican would do well in that I think I'm gonna win. But I don't want to name those states.
But I mean Michigan and Pennsylvania.
That's my attitude on the military. I don't like telling the enemy what I'm doing. I think I'll do well in Michigan. I've been talking about cars for five years. And how unfair it is that...
Jobs.
Yeah, I've been talking about Michigan for five years. I won Michigan in a massive landslide. Remember, I beat Kasich. Remember, Kasich was gonna win Michigan? There was only one problem.
He didn't.
He had the wrong person he was running against, OK? Remember he was gonna win, you know, the whole belt around him? Except one problem: I won everything around him. And I did well in Ohio, too, by the way.
What do you mean?
I'm gonna do two or three $10 million PACs at the right time.
What does that mean, though, a PAC?
Anti-certain candidate PACs.
You mean Clinton, or elsewhere?
I'm not saying against her, but I'm gonna do anti-, I'll be active in politics through PACs at a later date.
Like during this election year, or?
No.
Or in the future?
For future elections.
Oh. So if there's a candidate you don't like who's running, you would fund a PAC to hurt them?
Republican or Democrat.
Really?
Yeah. That I'll do.
Would you do that against Cruz, if he runs again?
Maybe.
He seems to want to run again.
Maybe against Kasich.
They both want to run.
Cruz's numbers have gone through the floor. Now that showed loyalty.
I was on the floor of the convention when that happened...
They had to bring his wife out. She was in danger.
... and interviewed a lot of delegates and they were very upset with him.
From Texas.
The Swiss bank account.
He did nothing wrong. They took a couple of lines that were absolutely perfect and they made him look bad. Now, my returns are four feet tall.
I think we'd all like to see them.
Show him the picture with the tax return. So, the audit's routine. I've been audited for many, many years in a row, which I think is unfair, but that's the way it is.
All right, joining us now on the phone, Donald Trump. Good morning, Mr. Trump and welcome to the program.
Good morning.
What's your response to what Warren Buffett had to say?
Well, I don't care much about Warren Buffett. You know, I had a public company, it was based in Atlantic City. The numbers -- and if you look at Atlantic City, Atlantic City was run down the tubes and you look at everything that's happened in Atlantic City, they're all, you know, bad. I've been out of there for seven years. I had great timing. I got out and I made a lot of money in Atlantic City over the years. You know, I have to look at myself, I have to look at my company, and I made a lot of money. It was a relatively small public company, it was the only one I've ever had, I believe, and it was just a company based out of Atlantic City.
Is this your counter punch, sir?
I did very well in Atlantic City. Then I took the company public. I took a lot of money out of Atlantic City, which is what I'm supposed to do, I'm a business person. Made a lot of money and I did well during the good times there in Atlantic City. But then, times started going very bad in Atlantic City. Ceasar's is bankrupt. You look at all of the bankruptcies in Atlantic City, you look at all of the problems, you look at the numbers, and a lot of mistakes were made. They built the wrong convention center in the wrong location. I was telling them, don't do it, don't do it, and they built it in the wrong location. They didn't build the airport. They were supposed to build a wonderful airport, it never happened. They made a lot of mistakes there, and I got out seven years ago and, you know, my timing was good because Atlantic City has had a hard time, a very hard time.
Is this your counter punch? A lot of your supporters don't want you to take the bait with every provocation. Was that a --
No, there's no counterpunch. I'm not listening to what -- look, Warren Buffett has been a fan of -- he's a Democrat. He's been a Hillary fan for a long time and I think that's fine. Hillary is a disaster. She lied over the weekend to Fox. I mean, you saw that, to Chris Wallace, and lied over the weekend. I'm sitting there listening to that interview and I couldn't believe it, the way she talked. You just heard the FBI director say she lied and she said no, she didn't, he didn't say that. And it was a total lie. In fact, even The Washington Post  gave her four Pinocchios, which I guess is their ultimate. But she is -- she's a liar. There's no question about that. Lies about everything. How she got away wit hit --
But that's not what's in the media this morning. The media -- the media is still looking at the Khan thing from last Thursday, and now you've got Warren Buffett. This is all a distraction. Your message about bringing prosperity to America is not getting through because of these distractions, when you take the bait with your critics.
Well, no, but you asked me a question, what do I think. Now I could say, I have no comment. I'd rather make a comment on it, but you're asking me the question. So when you ask me, I just gave you a quick answer, that Atlantic City has always been a very tough investment for a lot of people, and if you look at other companies, and you look at where they are with Atlantic City, Atlantic City has been -- over the last 10, 12 years, it's been a very tough place to invest, and that's fine. I got out of there seven years ago. So all I'm doing is trying to respond to your question.
How much are you talking about, for infrastructure?
Well, I would say at least double her numbers, and you're going to really need more than that. We have bridges that are falling down. I don't know if you've seen the warning charts, but we have many, many bridges that are in danger of falling and --
Where does the money come from? If you're talking close to a trillion or 800 billion or very close to a trillion, if that's the number you're talking about, where do you get that money from?
We're going to go out with a fund, we'll get a fund, we'll make a phenomenal deal with the low interest rates, and we're going to have to rebuild our infrastructure. We have no choice.
Who would put money into that fund?
Excuse me?
Who would put money into the fund?
People, investors. People would put money into the fund. The citizens would put money into the fund. And we will rebuild our infrastructure with that fund and it will be a great investment and it's going to put a lot of people to work. We need jobs, because if you look -- the real number is not 5 percent. It's probably closer to 20 percent. Because people have given up looking for jobs. We need jobs. We need jobs. You look at the inner cities of our country, I mean, you have black unemployment, youth, 58 percent unemployment. Nobody's ever seen numbers like this.
What kind of rate of return would you offer? If I wanted to put money into this fund as a private individual, what do you offer me in return?
Well, these would be bonds, Stuart. These would be bonds, and these would be sold as bonds. So we'd do infrastructure bonds from the country, from the United States. We do to infrastructure bonds. We have to fix our infrastructure. But we have to fix it without cost overruns. We have to get it done properly. Like I'm building the old post office on Pennsylvania Avenue. We're under budget and ahead of schedule by over a year. That's the way we have to build. You can't have -- I just left an area where they have a VA hospital that has a $1.2 billion cost overrun, OK, and it's still under construction. They don't know what's happening. They've totally lost control of it. It's a VA hospital. 1.2 billion in cost overruns. It's ridiculous. The whole thing should have been built for just a fraction of what they're talking about for the cost overrun. So nobody can build better than I can. Nobody knows construction better than I can. I have great relationships with the people that are going to do the work, and they have the wrong contract system. They have a system that inspires cost overruns, and we can't do that.
Well, if we did cut taxes for individuals and for corporations, and we had a huge infrastructure fund, would that give us four percent growth or better?
I think we'll get better than 4 percent growth. Don't forget, just the 2.5 trillion, which I actually think is $5 trillion -- that all of these companies have outside of the United States, and you know about corporate inversion. A lot of companies are leaving in order to get their money. They're leaving because taxes are too high. But they're also leaving to get the money. They can't bring the money back in. So they have money outside of the country, they're leaving to get their money because they can't bring it in. Just bringing that money in will be tremendous, tremendous.
A lot of people, I know, some people on Wall Street, they've got these dire predictions about what happens to the stock market if you're elected. There's a lot of people are saying it goes straight down. What's your response to that?
Well, I think it's going to go great. I think it's going to go great. We're going to spare a lot of things. I built tremendous wealth for myself, I've been doing it for myself, but I built a tremendous company with some of the greatest assets in the world, some of my assets, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world. I have very, very low debt. I've had it both ways. I love debt. I've always liked leverage and debt. But as you get older, you don't like it as much, to be honest with you.
Are you an investor in the stock market now?
I did, and I got out. I did invest and I got out, and it was actually very good timing. But I've never been a big investor in the stock market.
All right.
She will be terrible. Look at the lie. Look at the lies. Look at the lie over the weekend that she told about the FBI director. I mean, such a lie. I was listening to it. I said, how can anybody even say that after what was said about her?
OK. Let --
So I think she has the potential to be even worse.
Yes.
And it's already sort of falling into the background. This was a press event. The press played it day in day out. CNN which is a totally dishonest. Let me just tell you. CNN which is a totally dishonest group just kept playing it over and over.
All right. I can identify they did the same thing to me last week because I gave historical facts about how the White House --
I saw that and it didn't stop.
So, look, and it will never stop. But look, here is what your supporters want to know and some people are undecided who you need to persuade over to your camp. It wasn't wise to bring the mother in. I understand Khan. And I got that, you know, he is going to come after you and he was obviously hired by the Clinton campaign to do that. It was orchestrated as we just said in the talking points. Everybody knew the script. But the mother is just sitting there. And for you to bring her in, that gives him the opportunity. You just opens the door for them to come in and hammer you as this mean kind of guy.
I understand that, but, you know, part of it is I read a lot and I watched a lot. And many, many people discuss this. Many, many people they said. So, when I said it, it became like a big deal. And that's, you know, the way it is. But I was very viciously attacked and I said not very viciously back. And the press -- especially CNN, I mean, because they are very dishonest. They must be having very bad ratings problems or something which actually I hear they are. But they just kept it going and it never stopped. And, honestly, it's too bad.
All right. But the "New York Times."
Tremendously unfair.
Right.
Tremendously unfair treatment.
On page one, your Vietnam, you know draft status. By doing this and I had to learn this the hard way with that despicable Al Franken, all right? If you go after somebody and you're punching down as they say, all right? The left wing press is going to say you are a racist and a bully and sexist.
I agree.
Yes.
They are so dishonest. First of all they are losing a fortune.
They're waiting. So, they should have done the Vietnam thing when got into that Kerfuffle with John McCain. They would have been the time. But they held him because he is a Republican. So, they didn't mind you hammering him.
But just so you understand and so your viewers understand nothing was wrong. I had some academic exemptions. I had -- it was a very minor thing. They didn't even talk about the draft number I got. I got 356, I think it was draft number. It was a lottery. They didn't even mention.
But before the lottery, they said you had -- but it doesn't matter what they said.
What I'm saying Bill is this.
They are going to give it to you no matter what.
The New York Times is unbelievably dishonest. They are failing. It's a failing newspaper. It's losing a fortune. Probably it won't be around for more than two or three years. And, you know, they write and they keep writing. And I believe if they write something wrong, I believe in fighting back a little bit. I don't know if I should. Maybe I shouldn't.
It depends on who you fight against.
So far it has been working in all fairness.
If you want to beat me up, remember when you said I need a psychiatrist, that's fine, people like said yes, he does.
Right. Well, I said it kiddingly.
Yes. But anyway, you can fight me. You can come at me. But if there is some little Muslim woman who loses a son, you can't. You just can't. No matter what she does. She can get set you on fire and you can say, thank you I hated those trousers.
I know.
You know, you just got to let it go.
I didn't fight her.
We'll hold you over.
But please remember, I was viciously attacked and all I did was respond to it and it ends up being a four day story.
Continuing now, Donald Trump joins us from his headquarters here in New York City. Why would you think that the election would be rigged?
Well, I'm looking at all of these decisions coming on down from the standpoint of identification voter I.D. And I'm saying, what do you mean? You don't have to have voter I.D. to now go in and vote? And it's a little bit scary. And I have heard a lot of bad things. I must say four years ago I was hearing a lot of bad things having to do with the Romney campaign where, you know, when the vote came out there were some districts who were really shockingly different from what they were anticipated to be. And I have been saying it and I have been hearing it a lot. But the whole thing with voter I.D., identification, I think is really -- I mean people are going to walk in, they're going to vote 10 times maybe. Who knows? They are going to vote 10 times.
All right.
So, I am very concerned and I hope the Republicans are going to be very watchful.
Yes. They got to be vigilant. Everybody has too.
Everybody has got to be very watchful.
OK.
Because I want to tell you, I believe it's going to be just like Bernie Sanders, I said it was rigged. Well, it's rigged here too, believe me. So, I just hope the Republicans are going to be very watchful.
What about The Washington Post report today that you are not going to support John McCain's reelection or Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire, is that true?
I'm only thinking about it. I mean, I have, you know, never been a big fan of John McCain. And I just hate the way our veterans have been treated by John and other people. I hate it. I look at our veterans how badly they have been treated. The suicides.
What did John McCain done to veterans though?
Well, he should have grabbed that issue. That's his issue. He should have grabbed it. I have never been happy about that. And by the way, you knew about that a long time ago when I was on your show.
Yes. Of course.
Bill, I haven't made a decision on John McCain. And in New Hampshire I'm leading by a lot. I'm doing great. And you have a senator who I don't know who sort of doesn't want to get involved and I'm doing better than she is and I think that's fine. I mean, she's, you know, doesn't speak about me. But I'm doing very well in New Hampshire.
If you are president, you are going to want as many Republican senators and Congress people as you can get.
I didn't say anything. I'm just saying if they are not, you know, if she is not involved with me, I'm just not involved with that. I'm very involved with New Hampshire. I love New Hampshire. I have done a lot for New Hampshire and New Hampshire, frankly, likes me. But I have a nice lead in New Hampshire and she doesn't.
That's because people want change. They want change. They don't want conventional politics.
I want change. And by the way, and that's her second part. She said she is the person of change. The reason she has to say that is because things are going so badly. When you look at a one percent, 1.2 percent growth. That means we're dying, OK. We're dying.
Yes.
China, if they're at seven or eight percent, they, you know, actually what they do is they start devaluing their currency. That's what they do. But if they are at seven or eight percent, that's considered terrible. We are at one percent, Bill. We are dying. And you look at everything else.
All right.
We are failing with ISIS. We are failing in every category.
Well, if it's issues, if it's issues --
I think my temperament is great for women.
All right. But that's where they're coming at you on the temperament issue. And we always appreciate you coming on. We know how busy you are. Thank you, Mr. Trump. We appreciate it.
Thank you.
Some other election, some other day, you think there should be a female president.
No, it's going to happen, absolutely. Probably won't be very long, but it should not be her.
So we've talked a lot about Hillary Clinton's judgment. She's taken questions from the press. She's taken, you know, a beating from you at times over her judgment. I'm curious about your judgment. You made this statement about Russia the other day and saying, oh, it would be nice if they put her emails out there.
Well, I'll tell you what. Let me just tell you first of all that was said sarcastically, and everybody knew that.
So I understand you're saying you meant it sarcastically, but you're running for president and you get a megaphone unlike anybody's megaphone if you become president. Words matter so much.
Sure. But everybody knew that was sarcastic. You do too. But everybody knew that was sarcasm. And frankly, it really related to the fact the she deleted 33,000 emails. What a terrible thing to do. Wouldn't you love to know what was on those emails?
You wouldn't let him?
No.
Even if you picked him as AG?
Well you're asking me. I wouldn't do that, no.
You think Colorado should be able to do what it's doing.
I think it's up to the states, yeah. I'm a states person. I think it should be up to the states, absolutely.
And while we are on the top of state, local control, fracking is a big issue in Colorado. We actually had a couple of cities here where the voters said they wanted to ban or put a pause on fracking in their city limits. They weren't allowed to do it by the courts. However you feel about fracking, should voters be able to vote?
Well, I'm in favor of fracking, but voters should have a big say in it. Some areas maybe they don't want to have fracking. And I think if the voters are voting for it, that's up to them.
Should they be able to ban it in their town if they vote for it?
It could be. It could very well be. I'd have to see the specific instance, but it could very well be. But fracking is something that we need. Fracking is something that's here whether we like it or not, but if a municipality or a state wants to ban fracking, I can understand that.
How would you characterize your relationship with Vladimir Putin?
I have no relationship with Putin other than I think to say that he has said very good things about me over the years.
You've said before that you had a relationship with him.
No, well, I have no relationship with Vladimir Putin. I did?
You did? What was it like?
What did I say? You said I said.
You were quoted in an interview, I believe it was 2012. I would have to go back and look at it.
You'd have to show me the interview. No, I don't know Vladimir Putin.
So out west the federal government owns 47 percent of the land. Is that too much?
Well, I'm going to look into that. It's a question I get asked an awful lot out here, and I am going to take a very serious look at that. And we will get back to you on that one because a lot of people are wanting to really have policy on that. I'm going to come up with it, and I'm in the process of doing it right now. And I have some pretty strong opinions, but I won't talk about it right now.
You must have seen anger on it. You had the whole Cliven Bundy episode. What do you make of that? What do make of the hold up at the refuge?
It was a tough period of time. It was very tough.
Did they go too far?
There was a lot of emotion. And well, I'm not going to comment on who went too far, but I will tell you there's a lot of emotion on that issue.
So, I want to tell you a story. This guy who drove me to the airport last night going to become a citizen, he's from India, going to become a citizen in a month or two and he says he's leaning towards voting for you. It'll be his first election. You'll like that. Because you talk tough on illegal immigration. He wants people to do it above board. But you know he told me he thought it was more practical to punish these people with extra taxes or do something like that rather than deport 11 million people.
No, I understand. And then there are some people who think you should do that. Again, I have said that we are going to have very strong borders, but people are going to come in, tremendous numbers of people are going to come in, but they are going to come in legally. They have to come in legally. If we don't have strong borders, and they don't come in legally, we don't have a country.
I understand. You want to enforce the laws.
I want to enforce the laws.
More stringent.
I don't want new laws. I don't want old laws. We're just going to keep the laws just the way we have it right now. Obama, people don't know this, he's taken out 2.5 million people. Nobody knows that. Nobody ever mentions that. So, we're going to enforce the laws.
You made a big point in the primary about self-funding your campaign and how that made you independent and not beholden to people. What do you say now that you're fundraising?
Well, I am self-funding my campaign. If you
Well, I understand you're putting money in.
Let me explain. I put in about close to $60 million for the primaries. Now, uh, since then I've put in a lot of money toward the general. I'm also raising money and helping the Republicans raise money for the Republican National Committee and for the Republican Party. So I'm raising a lot of money for the Republican National Committee and for the Republican Party. But I'm also putting in a lot of my own money. Spending a lot of money.
Yeah.
Because of that. And they form a group and they go out and they try and get some publicity for themselves. And they hope that somebody else other than Trump wins because that way they can get a job.
I think you make a really good point. Because that is exactly what the people are fighting against, this elitism, something that you have squarely put on the front of the table here. Let me get your take --
Maria this is the way I won in the primaries --
Yep.
And then I won the primaries by fighting all of these insiders. And people are rejecting the insiders and you know I got 14 million votes. And people are reject -- which is the most ever in the history of the primary system for the Republicans. And you know frankly people are fighting exactly what these people are doing.
One of the cruxes to your plan is this 15% corporate tax rate.
Right.
Right.
But we're at a 1% level. China goes down to 7% and they have a problem.
Right.
That money's going to come in. There will be a 10% tax to pay on it. And that money will come roaring in too.
And you've been talking about that money overseas for a while throughout the whole primary season. Let me ask you about unveiling some names of people that you are thinking about considering Mr. Trump. Because a lot of people believe that that would really resonate to anybody who is skeptical of you today and just not sure. They like what you're talking about in terms of immigration. They like what you're talking about in terms of taxes, certainly on the business side. And yet they're just not sure yet. Would it be helpful to you to start telling the world some of the names that you're going to surround yourself with? Would that be helpful? Is that something that you're planning after Labor Day?
Well it is. And we're waiting until September and we've got great names. And you know some of them. You understand. We have some tremendous names. And these are people that are current people, not people from the past like you just mentioned before about the list --
So you will reveal that after September then?
Yeah I am, I'm going to reveal both economically which you know, were very instrumental in helping us with what we did. It's been reviewed very, very strongly by a lot of people Maria. A lot of people are liking it a lot. We have to do something. Our taxes are too high. We're one of the most highly taxed nations in the world. We have to do something. So we're going to be revealing out very shortly a list probably in September.
So you do want to spend when it comes to military. But in terms of raising revenue elsewhere, where would you be cutting back?
Well we're cutting back, I mean whether it's a penny plan which is something that as simple as it is, I've always sort of liked. You know the penny plan. You cut a penny from the dollar and you do it for five years and then all of sudden, out of expenses, all of a sudden you're in a position where, you know, you've got yourself down to a low number. The only thing I would do, we would negotiate tougher deals but we've got to spend on the military.
How --
So we'll see.
How worried are you about the other races? I mean a lot of people are concerned that the GOP will lose the Senate. And then of course we've got Wisconsin voters headed today for the primary for Paul Ryan. You did endorse him but we know that there's been an iciness between the two of you. What's your take on the Wisconsin primary today and how important is that?
I don't think there's an icing.
OK.
I have a good relationship with Paul. No I don't think there's an icing. Maybe the press reports that. But we've had a good relationship. And I endorse Paul. No we have some primaries today and it will be interesting to see how it all comes out. But I would think Paul would be in good shape.
All right and I was seeing that the three rates that you're going to do for your tax plan, 12, 25 and 33%, that's higher than some people wanted in terms of the top rate. But it is very much the same three rates that House Republicans have proposed. Should we look at that as unity within the party? As people coming together and getting behind you?
Well there's another rate, zero, for a lot of people that aren't making very much money. And that's in there big league. But you know you have a zero for people that aren't making very much money. And you know I think the rates are now at a level that they're much lower. The right income is coming in, the business rate is fantastic, it's going to bring a lot of business, a lot of jobs. And it's a plan that's gotten very good reviews.
Mr. Trump, good to talk with you. Thanks so much for joining us this morning.
Thank you very much Maria.
We appreciate it. We'll be watching.
OK.
A lot of old people on that court.
And our country will never be the same.
$1.3 billion.
You're going to have more regulations. You're going to still have ISIS -- right. You're going to still have ISIS all over the place because she's not going to attack them properly. We've got to take them out. We've got to take them out big league and fast. You're going to have ISIS -- that's what you have. You're basically going to get four more years, Sean, of Obama, and four more years of Obama is a disaster. It's unacceptable.
Let me...
It means...
The mother was on last night...
... the mother left. And they said...
Yes.
So it's very unfair.
Yes.
But as close to Justice Scalia as we can get.
And you're going to lower the corporate rate. You're going to allow multinational corporations...
Big league.
You'll expand coal mining...
... and lots of different places. But the miners are out of business.
You'll -- she said she wants to fire coal miners. They're going to lose jobs, and coal companies out of business. So you expand coal mining. You'll expand drilling. You'll expanded fracking, nuclear and new technology. Is that a fair statement?
Yes, 100 percent true. All of it.
All right...
A hundred percent true.
And -- and the plan you laid out yesterday on corporate rates and repatriation for multinational corporations, that's going to happen. And about half of American workers won't pay any federal income tax under your plan.
A tremendous amount will not pay anything, and the rates are going to be very low. The tax cut is massive. And the corporate tax cut -- people are going to bring back companies. They're going to start companies. The jobs are going to flourish. And I think we'll go over the 4 percent. Right now, we're practically at nothing.
And you will not allow refugees in from countries that practice sharia or where our national director of intelligence, FBI, CIA director are warning that ISIS will infiltrate without proper, 100 percent vetting?
That is correct, 100 percent. And there's going to be extreme vetting.
And you will build that wall. How certain is -- who was it, Jeb Bush said he's not going to build that wall. That's never going to happen. Is that wall going up?
Oh, we're going to build the wall. We need the wall. These security -- as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500, they endorsed me. And when they did, I said, Tell me, the wall, really important? They said, Mr. Trump, we desperately need it.
And you...
The wall we want, the wall we need, and we're going to have the wall. And Mexico is going to pay for the wall, by the way, Sean, just in case. They're going to pay because we lose so much money in terms of trade deficit with Mexico, Mexico will pay for the wall.
Yes.
But they'll all be better. And you -- you don't have to be limited to one or two. We can use other methods...
You know, one of...
... but people will be paying a lot less money. Sean, they'll be paying a lot less money for a lot better care.
You know what...
But we have to build up our military. It's very depleted.
It's scary.
And you know, they form because Trump isn't their kind of a guy. I don't want these people. We're going to have so much better. It's going to be so much better, Sean, your head will spin.
All right...
So much better.
Mr. Trump, always appreciate your time. Thank you for being with us.
Thank you. Thank you very much, Sean.
It wasn't a bad joke --
The NRA came out --
And I'm pleased now to welcome Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, welcome back to the Hugh Hewitt Show.
Yes, good morning.
We're a little bit late, so I hope I get a little reprieve on the time that Hope gave me.
Oh, we're going to have to do that. I think we're going to have to do that. I did another show, and they just wouldn't let me off. As you say, I get the best ratings, or whatever you say.
You're the best interview. You're the best interview.
They, Hugh, they would not let me off the show. I should have mentioned your name, OK?
Oh, well, I may do the same. I may have to just hold you hostage here. OK, Donald Trump, let's get started. The obviously question, I want you to hit it out of the park again. You did last night. Did you intend to incite violence against Secretary Clinton with your comments on Monday?
No, of course not, and people know that. Rudy Giuliani was there, and being a lawyer, he made a very good case, and actually, a very strong case, but absolutely not. We're talking about the power of the voter. We're talking about the tremendous power, and you understand this probably better than anybody, the power behind the 2nd Amendment, the strength behind the 2nd Amendment. And we're talking about the power of the voter. And the voter does have tremendous power. And the Democrats want to decimate the 2nd Amendment. They want to literally decimate it. And if they get in, they are going to decimate it. But they have to go through various elections, and we're going to see what happens. But the National Rifle Association, which endorsed me, you know, they're very concerned about the Supreme Court and many other things. And I think that I can tell you, they endorsed me, I think the earliest endorsement they've ever made, and they feel very strongly about it. And they've been terrific. And these are great people. These, Wayne and Chris and all of them, they're great people. These are people that love our country.
OK.
So we're talking about the power of the voter.
All right, let me move on, then. Clinton is using against you an ad called Too Dangerous. I've seen it. If I've seen it once, I've seen it 20 times already. Are you too dangerous to be president, Donald Trump?
No, the opposite. She is. If you look at her, and you listen to the Secret Service agent that wrote the book, she's a mess, a total mess. And she'll do an event, and then you don't hear from her. I think she goes home, she goes to sleep. You do, you follow her, just follow where she goes, and you know, she'll see, she'll do an event, she'll make a short speech off a teleprompter, and then she goes home and goes to sleep. I tell you, she is dangerous. And as far as temperament's concerned, you know, I've always been, I've always been, it's always been stated that I have the great temperament, because I have a winning temperament. I've been winning all my life. And that's what I do, is win. And that's what we have to do for our country on trade deals. We have to rebuild our military. It's totally depleted, as you know very well. We have to take care of our vets. We have so many things to do, it's incredible. And we're not a respected country. And you look at different countries, Russia hates us, they really dislike Obama so much, and other countries like China taking advantage of us, building a massive fortress in the South China Sea. You take a look at that, and you say how is that happening? And we can solve the problems. We can solve the problems easy. And then you look at the big problem where we have no growth. You look at it, I mean, look at the numbers that just came out. We have no growth. You know, Russia, if they have 7% or 8%, it's like a national catastrophe. So they devalue and they do lots of other things, and they get back on track, much to our expense, by the way.
All right, now my colleague, this too dangerous attack does stick. It's what they used against Barry Goldwater. My colleague, Robert O'Brien, argued over at Real Clear Politics this week that the way you blunt that is to name who's going to be your Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense, and O'Brien suggested John Bolton for State and Jim Talent for Defense. Despite what some people say, that's not illegal. It's perfectly acceptable. It would help you tremendously. Will you name your SecDef and your Secretary of State?
Well, it is not illegal. It's seldom done, surprisingly, but it is not illegal by any stretch, and surprisingly seldom done. And it's one of the things I wonder about. Why is it so little done? And I was actually given a very good answer, because once you name somebody, they attack that person viciously, whereas if you don't and you win, and then you put the same person in, nobody cares. So if you name, you know, pick a good name and there are plenty of them, we pick a good name, we put them into a position, everybody's happy, that person for the next 90 days gets attacked viciously. That's why people haven't traditionally done that. Does that make sense to you?
But if John Bolton said yes, he would consolidate and telegraph seriousness and expansive knowledge. If Jim Talent said yes, you'd get all of his experience on the Quadrennial Commission/Review Board. I mean, those two guys would make Team Trump look massively experienced right away, and the Too Dangerous argument goes away.
Well, I think that's true. I think John Bolton's a good man. I watched him yesterday, actually, and he was very good in defending me in some of my views, and very, very strong. And I've always liked John Bolton. Well, we are thinking about it, Hugh. I will say that. We are thinking about it. I mean, the negative is what I told you. But we are seriously thinking about it.
All right, now the NeverTrump movement says, I've been writing about how important the Supreme Court is.
Are they still around?
At Heritage, yeah.
... knows those names and respect those names. I have a lot of respect for Jim DeMint. And we have, you know, we have a great list. It's a great list of people. Yeah, I mean, if we veered from that, I would say block it, and I would be very happy with that. And I wouldn't even fight it, because I won't have to.
Now NeverTrump is still out there. Is it hurting you? Or is it hurting Republicans down the ballot at this point?
Well, I don't know that it's hurting me. It's a very weak movement. It's a pathetic movement. I mean, if you just, you just mentioned it, the Supreme Court. If I don't get in, you're going to have, because they're being forced so far left by the Bernie Sanders crowd, if I don't get in, you are going to have, it could be four, it could even be five, there's a possibility, but let's say four or three Supreme Court justices named who are going to be super liberal. We're going to be Venezuela large-scale version. It's so important, that you would think that everybody should join the wagon.
Yup.
But it looks like that won't happen, and that's OK. Don't forget, when I won, I didn't have the support of anybody. You know, I ran as an outsider. I happen to think I'm better off running as an outsider here, too. But you know, I'm getting along, and people don't really, you understand it, but people don't understand it. I have tremendous support within the party. I have many Senators, most of them, I have most of the Congress. I have tremendous people -- Jeff Sessions and so many others. But if we have a rogue, you know, that announces we're going to not support Trump, that person gets their one day of publicity, but you know, and they don't write all the other people that are with. But with that being said, you know, I run best as an outsider. And I've said it.
True, true.
You know, I don't...
I just think they're hurting down ballot races. I don't know that they're hurting you. People have their minds made up on you almost certainly. It might change because of stories like yesterday. I want to talk to you now about Gilbert Chagoury. I had never heard this name until yesterday, the Lebanese-Nigerian billionaire that got the Clinton Foundation guy, Band, to call up Huma and email Cheryl Mills. This guy's a bad guy. He was the aide to the Nigerian dictator. He had to pay $300 million dollars off to Nigeria to get off of charges. And in April of 2009, the Clinton Foundation calls up Hillary Clinton's staff and gets favors done for this guy. How come that's not front page everywhere, Donald Trump?
Well, because they cover things that are, that should not be covered. And they seem to like to cover anything I say. They try and dissect the words, and CNN in particular has been incredible in their, you know, they're trying so hard to get ratings, and it's not working. But they'll take something that is a totally, a totally fine statement, and they'll make it look like oh, gee, let's analyze it. They'll analyze it 77 different ways. In the end, it's fine, and they go onto their next story. And yet a story like you just mentioned, they don't cover it. It's incredible.
You ought to be demanding Gilbert Chagoury...
We have a double standard. We have a double standard in the press.
You ought to be using his name every day, Gilbert Chagoury, and making people investigate it, because he's a...
Yeah, but people don't cover it. The New York Times won't cover it, importantly, the various other newspapers won't cover it. I mean, they're very dishonest people. The New York Times is a very dishonest newspaper.
No, Chagoury did show up in the New York Times, so I'll give them that. Let me ask you, by the way, about the media.
I'm not saying that. I'm saying they won't cover it much.
Right.
It'll be a one-time hit, because they have an obligation, and then you won't see it again.
Let me talk to you about the media. You still have the media ban in place. I'd really love for you to get that off of the Post, because it's the American way. You've got nothing to worry about from these guys. They're going to be against you anyway. Why not let them into the rallies?
It's something I don't even think about. You know...
You should let them in.
I don't even think. I should let others out.
Really, just because...
No, I don't think about it. I mean, honestly, they are so dishonest that I say yeah, let them get in there. They can come in. By the way, they're allowed to come in. You know, last night, I had 10,000 people. You probably saw that.
Yeah, I did. I played some of the rally.
The place was packed. And you know, they can come in like everybody else. I'm just, you know, it's something I'm not, I don't think about it. But the, when you look at the kind of coverage, everybody admits it's dishonest. Some people say hey, I've been in this business for 25 years. There has never been a pile-on like this. And that's OK. They're very dishonest. They've very much discredited themselves. People see what's happening. It's a pile-on, and I find it interesting. I mean, I'll talk about it.
Now...
I talk about it. I talk about it at the rallies. But you know, it's something that is not of great importance.
There was an old Roman ruler named Sulla, and he put on his tomb, "No friend has ever done me a favor, nor enemy an injury that I have not repaid in full." Is that Donald Trump-like?
Well, look, you know, I feel that if somebody's mistreating you, or if somebody's treating you badly, in this case, you know, constantly, I mean, just... you know, I'll have days where I say wow, did we do good, that speech was great, everything was great, you know, we're getting accolades all over the place, and then you'll see negative stories. I've seen it. I mean, I've seen it. I've seen it with the debates where I won every single debate and every single poll. I mean, I don't know if you agree with that, but every single poll, you know, they have Drudge and they have Time and they have Time Magazine, and they have, you know, like six or seven, and I was in 11 debates. And according to the polls, I won them by massive margins -- 80%, 75%, and then to have somebody that I know would never give good, and they'll say, you know, they'll try and make it look like it wasn't a victory as opposed to it was. But the people get it. There's great dishonesty out there, Hugh.
I know, but they're trying to make you appear dangerous. They're trying to make people afraid of you and an authoritarian. And the ban on the press, not only is it not in the American tradition, it plays into this, the enemies list. You know, she's got the enemies list. That's actually been published. She's the one who's vindictive. So I just don't want you playing into that. We've got to...
Look, I understand that, but the press is 100% on her side.
Oh, I agree, well, not this show.
And she's no good. She'll be terrible.
Not this show.
There was a story in the Washington Post yesterday that was so bad for her. That was why I was so shocked to see it, because it was in the Washington Post, which you know, doesn't do that. And it talked about her four years, her first four years as a Senator of New York. The promises she made to get economic development started in upstate New York, and what a disaster it turned out to be, they lost jobs instead of, she was going to create 200,000 jobs. It was a disaster. If anybody reads that story, they can't vote for Hillary Clinton.
All right, now let me talk to you about the debates. First of all, were you surprised by the meltdown at Fox News?
Well, when you say meltdown, you mean by Roger?
Yes.
Yeah, I was surprised. I was. Look, no matter what you say about him, he built one of the great, he was one of the great pioneers in the history of television. He built...
Agree.
... and incredible network in a relatively short period of time, and I was very surprised to see it, yes.
All right, now to debates, they're in kind of chaos there, so I'm going to leave Fox out of this for a moment. But if you negotiate hard, you can get Chuck Todd and Lester Holt. I think Jake Tapper and Wolf Blitzer were fair to you. I think Dana Bash is very fair to you. John Dickerson, Mary Katharine Ham, they did the ABC, I think all those people are fair. Yours truly, I think I was fair. Are you going to do these debates? And should you do more of them and ask for new moderators like the ones I just named?
Well, we don't know who the moderator is at the first debate. I mean, I have to say, and one of the things, I want to do the debates, as you know, I fully want to do the debates. I think they shouldn't have them against the NFL games, but you know, I think that's, I think it's stupid. Now we're going to outdraw the NFL. We're going to outdraw everybody, but why are they giving up 25,000, 25 million viewers? I mean, they're giving up 25 million viewers, mostly men, by the way. But they're going to give up a lot of viewers, and they'll still have this massive show. But why are they putting them, I mean, why aren't they having it on a non-NFL night?
I agree. They're stuck in...
Two of the three debates are against, you know, big NFL games.
Yeah, they're stuck in the past.
So you ask yourself, why would they do that, OK?
They're stuck in the past, but I think if you got Chuck Todd and Wolf Blitzer and Jake Tapper and Lester Holt and Dana Bash and Dickerson, new people, Mary Katharine Ham, you could even ask for me. I'd be happy to do it again, even though we have some dust-ups on stage. Don't you think that you should just name the people you want and throw down on this commission and say bring in the new blood?
I think we can, and I think that will happen, and I think we'll agree on somebody. I don't like all of the people that you mentioned, but some of them are good.
Who do you like?
I don't want to say that now. I'm not looking to insult anybody, but you know, I'm a person that doesn't like insulting people.
No, but I mean who do you like, not who you don't like, but who do you like?
I'd rather not say. No, honestly, I'd rather not say at this moment. I've given some ideas to the commission. I'll be, you know, we'll be making a decision soon, but I do want the debates. Again, I think they should, and this isn't, you know, a real negotiation, but I think it's absolutely, it doesn't make sense to have them against the NFL. They're losing so many viewers. You're losing so many viewers, and we're going to set a record, but you'd set a bigger record if you didn't do that. It doesn't make sense.
I've got two more questions. Last night, you said the President was the founder of ISIS. I know what you meant. You meant that he created the vacuum, he lost the peace.
No, I meant he's the founder of ISIS. I do. He was the most valuable player. I give him the most valuable player award. I give her, too, by the way, Hillary Clinton.
But he's not sympathetic to them. He hates them. He's trying to kill them.
I don't care. He was the founder. His, the way he got out of Iraq was that that was the founding of ISIS, OK?
Well, that, you know, I have a saying, Donald Trump, the mnemonic device I use is Every Liberal Really Seems So, So Sad. E is for Egypt, L is for Libya, S is for Syria, R is for Russia reset. They screwed everything up. You don't get any argument from me. But by using the term founder, they're hitting with you on this again. Mistake?
No, it's no mistake. Everyone's liking it. I think they're liking it. I give him the most valuable player award. And I give it to him, and I give it to, I gave the co-founder to Hillary. I don't know if you heard that.
I did. I did. I played it.
I gave her the co-founder.
I know what you're arguing...
You're not, and let me ask you, do you not like that?
I don't. I think I would say they created, they lost the peace. They created the Libyan vacuum, they created the vacuum into which ISIS came, but they didn't create ISIS. That's what I would say.
Well, I disagree.
All right, that's OK.
I mean, with his bad policies, that's why ISIS came about.
That's...
If he would have done things properly, you wouldn't have had ISIS.
That's true.
Therefore, he was the founder of ISIS.
And that's, I'd just use different language to communicate it, but let me close with this, because I know I'm keeping you long, and Hope's going to kill me.
But they wouldn't talk about your language, and they do talk about my language, right?
Well, good point. Good point. The stimulus -- President Obama spent $831 billion dollars. I asked people what did he build? A Democrat actually told me he built the viewing stand for the dinosaur museum. $831 billion dollars. When you gave your big Trump Tower tax cut speech, I said it's a tax cut as big as the Trump Tower. What would you do with $831 billion? What could you get built, Donald Trump, with $831 billion?
Oh, so much, so much. And by the way, it's really not enough to rebuild the infrastructure, but we need our roads, we need our highways, but we need them built, and this is so important, we need them built very rapidly. We need them built now. The roads are a disaster. You know, the trucks, these big trucking companies, they're losing their trucks because of the potholes and the problems and the roads. We need infrastructure, and it's got to be given out right. I'll give you an example. The old Post Office, which I'm building on Pennsylvania Avenue...
Trump International...
It's ahead of schedule by a year, and it's under budget. And it's much better than ever anticipated. In other words, I went even higher end. It's going to be one of the great hotels of the world. But I'm under budget and I'm ahead of schedule. Wouldn't it be nice if we could spend money like that?
Do you think any Democrat knows how to actually, you start with the Trump Tower, you end with Trump International in D.C. In between are all these projects. Do you think any Democrat or Hillary actually knows how to build anything, you know, from the design...
No, no.
... from the, just doing the balancing and the grading? I don't think they understand it.
No, no, they don't know how to build, they don't know how to give out a contract, they don't know how to have no cost overruns. You know, there's a hospital, a Veterans Administration hospital in a certain place that I was in. I won't mention them, because they're great people, and I don't want to embarrass. They have a $1.2 billion dollar cost overrun on a hospital, not even that big. They have a $1.2 billion, I said you mean million, they said no, no, billion. We have a $1.2 billion dollar cost overrun, and it's way late, years late, it's totally out of control. $1.2 billion dollars. That says it all. And everything we build, it's the same thing.
So you are definitely, let me wrap it up, then. You are definitely going to debate?
Oh, yeah, sure, I'm going to debate, but I want to get the terms so that I'm satisfied with them. No, I want to debate. I want to debate.
All right, so, and when you debate, you don't care who's in front of you, but you want new faces? I don't want the same old faces, Donald Trump, the same old guys. Do you want some new people?
Are you saying that? Are you saying that?
That's me. I want Chuck Todd and Lester Holt...
All right. OK, well, look, OK...
... and Jake Tapper...
I think Lester Holt is a good guy. I'm OK with having, to be honest with you, I'm OK with having new faces. I like some of the old faces, too, but I'm OK with having new faces. But I don't want to have people that are unfair. When you look at what Candy Crowley did with, you know, with Mitt Romney, that was so unfair. And she was wrong on top of everything.
She was wrong. But Chuck Todd won't do that. Dickerson won't do that. Jake and Wolf won't do that. Dana Bash was very fair to you, didn't you think?
I think she's had moments of great fairness.
Mary Katharine Ham, very fair to you.
I've never gotten along with her, no.
With Mary Katharine?
Never gotten along.
Oh, well, we'll have to check in on that. OK.
No, she is not a fan of mine, and I've never gotten along with her. So that...
OK, I'll ask her about that.
I don't know her. I don't know her, but she says only bad things, so let's cross her name off.
OK.
No, I do not, I do not.
You can put my name on...
I am not a fan. So listen, take care of yourself, I have to go. Just be good and keep up the good show and I'll do it again very soon.
Talk to you soon, Donald Trump.
OK. Thanks a lot.
This week has been a big one for the economy when it comes to what's been happening on the campaign trail. The Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump launched a refined economic plan for the general election. We look forward to talking to presidential candidates about a range of economic issues here on CNBC. This is our wheel house. In fact, yesterday we spoke to Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein. Today we'll be hearing from Libertarian Gary Johnson. That's coming up in the 8:00 hour. By the way, we've invited Hillary Clinton repeatedly to join us even just this week. She has not accepted any of those invitations. Of course, Secretary Clinton has an open invitation here on "Squawk Box " as soon as she chooses to take us up on that. One person who is joining us this morning on the Squawk newsline is GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, thank you for being here this week.
Good morning. I guess Hillary is sleeping.
She has not done a press conference this year. So we've repeatedly put out these invitations but we are looking forward to hear more on what's happening on the economy. I know this week on Monday in Detroit you laid out a more refined plan for what you planned to do. But you also hinted in that speech that you'd be giving more details. Can you give us any hints about what is still to come in terms of filling out some of that economic plan?
Well, we gave great detail in the speech. It was well reviewed and well received, I think very. And very -- basically we're about getting rid of massive regulations which are unnecessary which are killing businesses and making it virtually impossible. I mean, no matter what you do, it's making it virtually impossible to start new businesses. And a lot of old businesses are being hurt very badly. Obamacare is being hurt -- I mean, just absolutely decimating businesses if you look. I've gotten to know so many is small business owners and big business owners over the last period of eight months and I will tell you, Obamacare is devastating businesses. I get it all the time. I really see it. I'm sort of like a pollster. I can take a poll of the pulse. And the pulse isn't good because businesses are being destroyed. They're being destroyed by high taxes. They're being destroyed by Obamacare. And they're being destroyed by regulation. And we're doing a lot about each.
In terms of what specifically? Part of the concern from some think tanks out there who ran the numbers before was that your plan would create a massive deficit. $10 trillion to $12 trillion was kind of what the range ran. You laid out more details this week and I know many of the people we've talked to have pointed out that part of this is growth that will help with along the way. GDP would increase. Part of this is getting regulation. But can you put your arms around what type of deficit your plan you think would create?
I heard $3 trillion. I think it will be much less than that. We'll have a long-term accumulated deficit of $3 trillion. I think it's going to be much less than that, but we have to get our jobs started. We have to get our jobs back. Our jobs have been taken by so many countries. Our jobs have been taken by Mexico. Mexico is the eighth wonder of the world. Mexico, what they're doing down there. I go to rallies and I tell people there is a man who is a friend of mine who builds plants. He builds massive plants for automobiles and for computers and for everything. I ask him how are you doing. He said I'm doing great because of Mexico. Mexico is -- he told me he's the one that used the expression it's the eighth wonder of the world. What they're building in Mexico. I said how about the United States? He goes, not so much. Not doing great. Not doing a lot. Where he is building is in Mexico. And other places, but Mexico in particular. And we're losing businesses to Mexico like one after another. Ford is building a massive new plant. It's an extension of another one. It just keeps going. You look at carrier air conditioning from Indianapolis, Indiana. They're going down. And we can't continue to lose our companies. We're not going to have any companies left.
In your businesses, you've used leverage in the past. When you look at the shape of the yield curve for U.S.. Treasury debt at the moment, how low interest rates are, is this a moment for the U.S. To borrow and spend in order to stimulate growth that you spoke about infrastructure spending? Are you happy to boost the balance sheets it were of the U.S. economy at the moment?
Well, I've always loved leverage. As Becky can tell you. I've always, you know, respected leverage but I've always loved it. But a country is a different thing. However, with that being said, the interest rates are so low, I mean, the numbers are so low, that yes this is a time to borrow and borrow long-term. So that we have the money and rebuild our infrastructure. We could have the money -- we have things we have no choice. Our military is very depleted. Extremely depleted. People don't like to talk about our military is absolutely depleted from all of the different things we're doing and nobody knows where they are, who they're fighting. I mean, our people don't know anything. We have people that have no idea -- they're in so many different locations. Nobody knows what's going on. But the word depletion is the word that keeps getting used. We have to fix our military. We have to take care of our vets. It's a disaster what's going on with our vets. And the veterans administration. We have to fix our infrastructure. Our country's infrastructure is in horrible condition. Worst condition it's ever been in. Bridges are in -- I mean, in dangerous shape. I think 50% of the bridges are actually in dangerous shape. When you think of that, that's incredible. Where they could fall. Roads, tunnels, hospitals. I mean, everything. We have to fix the airports. Our airports are like third world countries. You go into some of these beautiful airports, you go into Dubai and you go into different places throughout the world and you see airports that are unbelievable. That we've never had in this country. And then you fly into La Guardia or you fly into LAX. Or you fly into Kennedy, any of them. You fly into these airports, it's like a third world country. So we have to fix our airports and our transportation system and our trains which are, you know, a hundred years old. We have trains from a hundred years ago. Those are the good ones. And you go to China and you go to these other places and you see the bullet trains. They go hundred miles an hour
How do you pay for all that, Mr. Trump?
So we need to fix our country. We've spent so much money in the Middle East. $4 trillion they're saying now. That means we spent more than that. But we've spent all this money in the Middle East. And by the way, we are now further away from something happening in the Middle East than if we did nothing. Had we done nothing, we would have been in better shape in the Middle East we spent $4 trillion and maybe even 5 -- and we are right now much further away, I mean, like not even close, much worse shape than had we done nothing.
How do we pay for that? And is it going to be public money? Is it private money? And as Wilfred just asked, what level of debt to GDP would you feel comfortable with?
Well, you could have combinations of private money you can even privatize certain things. Basically you're going out and borrowing money on the United States to rebuild your infrastructure. It would be infrastructure money and maybe there's ways of giving additional, you know, credits to people that buy these bonds. Frankly the interest rate would be so low.
That sounds a lot like Larry Summers.
Normally you would say you want to reduce your debt. And I would like to reduce debt too as much as anybody. The problem is you have a military problem, you have an infrastructure problem, a tremendous infrastructure problem. And you have other problems. And also, the asset is your rates are so low. What's going to happen when the rates eventually will go up and you can't borrow, you absolutely can't borrow because it's too expensive? It would destroy our balance sheet, totally destroy the balance sheet. So you'd be paying so little interest right now. This is the time to borrow.
Mr. Trump, you said you would at least double what Hillary Clinton wants to spend on infrastructure. That would imply some $500 billion. A half a trillion. What is the exact number you are willing to spend on infrastructure?
Well, you need a lot more than that to do it right. Now, I'd also make sure that we use the proper procedures. Because when you take a look at things, when you look at what we build, there's a hospital -- a recent hospital I won't say where because I don't want to insult the people. But they're great people. I just left three days ago. It's a VA hospital. It's got a $1.2 billion cost overrun. That's an overrun. The hospital should cost half of that price. They have a $1.2 billion cost overrun everything we build has a cost it's all cost overruns and a mess. It's always trauma and trouble. Because they don't know how to build. I would employ things -- as an example, I'm building the old post office on Pennsylvania avenue for all to see. I was the one, I was the successful bidder. I went out to bid. We're one year ahead of schedule. We're going to open in September. We're a year ahead of schedule and we're, you know, under budget. So I built it under budget. I built it ahead of schedule. And it's -- you know, that's, like, routine that you have to do. When you look at these public works projects or big highways, they come in for two and three and four time this cost of what they were supposed to come in you look at a hospital where they have a $1.2 billion cost overrun, it's insane. So one of the things we have to do is we have to make sure we have strong contracts, we have strong contractors and give them out properly. Right now they're obviously not giving out contracts properly because everything that comes in comes in way over budget. You rarely see a job -- a federal job, a federal project come in under budget and ahead of schedule.
Mr. Trump, your friend Carl Icahn called into my program at noon the other day and reiterated his support for you. He thought the speech that you gave in Detroit was in his words, right on. But at the same time he said and I quote, he's a smart guy and I think he understands the mistakes he's made. He was referring to the controversy over the Khan Gold Star family of a few weeks back. I'm wondering if you're willing to admit the mistake you made and clarify the comments you made on the second amendment regarding Hillary Clinton.
Well, on the Second Amendment, everybody came to my defense because there was nothing said wrong. I'm talking about the power of the voter. Nothing was said wrong, and only the haters tried to grab onto that one. And it was very unsuccessful. We're talking about it has tremendous support and tremendous power at the voting booth. And that was all. As far as Mr. Khan, I think it's been said by everybody. I think that's been very well talked about. That's been put to bed a long time ago.
Donald, back to Scott's point, though, we have had several of your biggest supporters who have come on our air this week to talk about your economic plan who said that they love your economic plan, they think it's a big winner. That includes Carl Icahn, Steve Forbes, Larry Kudlow who's talked about all of these issues. But all of them said they wish you would stick to the economic message. They think the issues you brought up along the way are unforced errors. What do you tell them?
Well, I don't think I've made too many errors. Look, I've beat 17 people. I started with 17. I now have one person who I think is pretty close to incompetent, Hillary Clinton. I think she's pretty close to incompetent. Take a look at The Washington Post story about Hillary Clinton from two days ago. I couldn't believe they wrote it because they never write anything bad about her. So they wrote a story about Hillary Clinton was a disaster as a senator from New York. She promised everything, delivered nothing. She was going to create a wonderful economic boom in Upstate New York. Same words she uses right now. And she not only created no boom, New York state, Upstate New York, and various other parts she was talking about became disaster areas. And they are a disaster area. People have fled. Businesses have left. They've gone to Mexico and other places. It's a disaster. And then they compared that with my record which was done by Steve Quaso in the New York Post where I built the city on the west side, I rejuvenated the grand terminal area when I built the Grand Hyatt. The Columbus Circle area when I did Trump International hotel and tower, I was there first. I got it going. And so many other areas. And I mean, it was a very nice story. But I've done a lot. And I've done a lot in terms -- they even mentioned the skating rink which was open for -- which was closed for seven years and they had spent $21 million trying to do it. And I had it fixed up in four months and opened and I have it to this day. And it's a tremendous success. I mean, it's a big difference. But Hillary Clinton, that Washington Post -- everybody ought to get that story and put that aside of her phony speech she'll make today in the afternoon. Read that story. Two days ago. She was a disaster for New York. She put in virtually no bills. The only bills were naming of a building and something that didn't matter much. Like very, very unimportant. Got nothing passed. And all of her talk about Upstate New York and all of her talk about revitalization was a total catastrophic event. And the voters of New York saw that and they were not happy.
Mr. Trump, I appreciate you're sticking to message. I've seen your article. I read it. But you're doing a good job of sticking to the message, but you have had Republican senators and congressmen who have disavowed you because of some of the other comments that have come up this week. How do you even work with these people if you are elected? Are you going to --
Well, I have a lot of support within Republicans. But whenever somebody doesn't support me, it becomes a bigger story. You know, I just -- look. When I won when I beat these 17 people because there were really 18 if you think. When I beat the 17 people, I wasn't exactly making myself popular. And I wasn't an insider. I was an outsider. Because of the fact -- I used to be like establishment. And then when I ran, I was the opposite of establishment. And I beat these people very badly. All right? So all of a sudden -- and that's when I did best. Frankly, when they were fighting me, those were --
Sure.
-- That was when I did best.
But you do realize this is a different stage now.
We have a lot of support.
I know and I see it at your rallies. But this is a different stage, Mr. Trump.
No. So many other senators are supporting me. We actually do. But you have some people that as an example, the list that signed, these are the people that got us into Iraq. These are the people that got us into all of the messes we're in all over the Middle East. These are the people that have us in an economic condition where China has literally ripped the heart out of us. Where China's taken so much money that they've rebuilt themselves and they're building massive military complexes in the middle of the South China Sea. These are the people that represented us. They know they're not working for me. I don't want these people. These people did a terrible job. And they know they're not getting jobs from me so they'll go to the other side.
But if you look at the polls --
Whatever happens, happens. I'm giving it straight. I don't know that it will work because I'm a non-political person and I'm proud of that. But I'm giving it straight.
Mr. Trump, you said --
I've done a great job and now I'm doing a good job politically. I came from this massive field of professionals, all governors and senators and people of vast talents and those people got knocked off one by one and now I'm down to the final person and you notice the polls are closing up very rapidly which is fine. Don't forget, she has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising. You know what I've spent, Becky? Zero.
But you've lost some of the Republican women. The latest poll from Wall Street Journal shows it's 72% of Republican women. Mitt Romney had 90% of that group and didn't win the election.
We'll see what happens. I have a whole group of people out there that people don't even know about. At the rally last night I had 10,000 people. If Hillary had that rally, she would have had 200 people if she was lucky. I don't know that translates to votes. In theory, it should. But I don't know it translates into votes. What does translate into votes is she's done a terrible job as senator from New York and totally -- and by the way, totally documented in The Washington Post article. She's done a terrible job --
Mr. Trump, I would ask you --
That article, it was a long detailed, very, very strong article. She'll be making a speech and saying all the same things she said about New York and she left and it was a disaster. In fact, it cost us a fortune because of what she did. It cost us a fortune. It cost us jobs. It cost Upstate New York. She's a negative.
Mr. Trump -- I want to ask you --
You have to look at that in light of her speech today which I am sure will be wonderful.
Not only do you not think it was an issue --
Because of the way he got out as bad as it was when they went in, they should have never gotten in. He shouldn't have gotten in the way he got out -- he shouldn't have gotten out the way he got out was a disaster what he did.
But how do you think --
Is there something wrong with saying that? Are people complaining that I said he was the founder of ISIS?
I'm wondering how you think that's going to play in some battleground states.
I don't know. Whatever it is it is. Look, all I do is tell the truth. I'm a truth teller. All I do is tell the truth. If at the end of 90 days I fall in short because I'm somewhat politically correct even though I'm supposed to be the smart one and even though I'm supposed to have a lot of good ideas, it's OK. I go back to a very good way of life. It's not what I'm looking to do. I think we're going to have a victory, but we'll see.
Look --
Pay for play and all of the stuff that's come out over the last couple of days which is basically selling jobs. And many other things. That's the least of it. What she does is illegal. She's done many illegal things. Emails, that's illegal. She wiped out 33,000 emails. I don't know. You know, they tend to have a different standard. If anyone else knocked out 33,000 emails, they would be in a problem like you wouldn't believe. She knocked out 33,000 emails. She got away with it. Frankly I think it's her single greatest achievement as a politician. Getting away with that. Because other people, their lives have been ruined. She got away with it.
Mr. Trump --
Missing 33,000 emails and they say oh that's fine.
Some would point out --
I'm telling you. New York state she was a disaster. As Secretary of State she was a disaster you take a look at Libya. You take a look at what she did. I'll tell you this. If Barack Obama had it to do again -- he'd never say this other than to his wife -- if he had it to do again, he would have never chosen Hillary Clinton to be Secretary of State. Because those decisions have been a disaster. The line in the sand. So many decisions. Crimea gone. He talks about Crimea. He talks about the Ukraine.
Let me ask you if I could --
During his administration, Trump will be friendly with Putin. I think it would be great. Number one, I don't know Putin. I couldn't care. I don't know Putin. But I think it would be great if the United States actually got along with Russia. Which we don't. But on his watch, Crimea was taken. And, you know, nobody mentions that.
Let me ask you if I could quickly before we go, you mentioned earlier how polls were I believe in your words tightening yet the new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist has you trailing in battleground states such as Iowa, Ohio and Pennsylvania by wide amounts. How do you close that gap?
Just keep doing the same thing I'm doing right now. At the end it's either going to work or I'm going to, you know, I'm going to have a very, very nice long vacation.
Mr. Trump, we want to thank you very much for joining us today. We do appreciate your time.
OK. Thank you very much.
All right. Let's move on to another subject. We have a lot to get to. Hillary Clinton keep saying that these email scandals are old news yet we keep getting more and more information as thanks to FOIA requests more emails in this latest round tying the Clinton Foundation to her tenure at the State Department possibly quid pro quo. Your thoughts?
Well, the email scandal is such a disaster that if it was anybody else in this country other than her, they would have been in prison a long time ago. She got rid of 33,000 emails. It's unheard of. Whoever heard of that. He talks about a wedding and yoga class. She got rid of 33,000 emails and whether they were deleted or clean, the server, the whole thing is corrupt. And, frankly, I think anybody else other than her -- look at what happened to General Petraeus. Look at what happened to so many other people for doing so much less. Anybody other than her would have been put away a long time ago.
You know, and some of these emails are coming through FOIA requests which take an insane amount of time to get these things released but also some, you know, some hacking. Some WikiLeaks, whatnot. Do you think there is an October surprise via email for Hillary Clinton?
I really don't know. But I can tell you when somebody loses 33,000, it's unbelievable. The number, the sheer magnitude, the number of emails and to have nothing happen when something like that happens, so I have no idea. We'll find out, I guess. But I have absolutely no idea.
But Donald, I want to get to this though. Have you been in contact? Have you called --
Yes, I have. He just put out a press release. I mean, he just put out a tweet saying it's untrue. And I mean, if it is true, that's OK, too. Because all I have to do is stop funding the Republican Party. I'm the one raising the money for them. In fact, right now, I'm in Orlando. I'm going to a fundraiser for the Republican Party. So, if they want to do that, they can save me a lot of time and a lot of energy.
And what about Hillary's medical records. Do you want to see those or you don't care?
No, I don't want to get into that. I think it would be inappropriate for me to comment.
All right. We'll leave it right there, Mr. Trump. Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Look, the reason I bring up this whole issue of stamina is because the president of the United States is a very demanding job.
Right.
You have two opponents. You've got Hillary Clinton, but you've also got the media.
Right. That's a bigger opponent.
Earlier in the week, in Detroit at the economic club, you presented an economic plan that included significant tax cuts for everybody, but especially for businesses.
Right.
Small businesses, down to 15 percent.
And middle income people, especially for them, too. But you're right, for businesses. Absolutely.
When you spoke about in Detroit and talked about the economic plans, you were doing that in a city that once was the world's center of manufacturing.
Not anymore.
Called the arsenal of democracy. I mean, Michigan basically saved America by being able to build our armaments during World War II.
Right.
Thank you very much. Great to visit with you.
Thank you very much, Mike.
Some of the criticism on you from conservatives is you're not a real conservative. When you hear that -- You know, someone will argue on social policies that you're not a real conservative. Is it just different brands of conservatism that's out there and you just have a different brand? Or do you think they have a point?
Well, I think they have a point from years ago. But they also have that same point with Ronald Reagan, who was a Democrat absolutely with a liberal bent. And Ronald Reagan became, you know, not only a Republican but a pretty conservative Repub -- not the most. But a pretty conservative Republican. And he's somebody that I actually knew and liked. And he liked me. And I worked with him and helped him. But I think that when you get right down to it, people do evolve on different issues. And, you know, I'm pro-life. And I was begrudgingly the other way. But I have to say when those questions were asked, and that was many, many years ago, I wasn't a politician.
Should some form of abortion always be legal?
Well, to me, I have exceptions. Rape, incest, if the mother is going to die. And Ronald Reagan had those same exceptions. And many Republicans have those same exceptions. But I say rape, incest --
You said life of the mother. What about health of the mother?
Well, I said actually if the mother's close to death. And I'm talking about death. You know, because then you sort of say, like, "Well, maybe she's not feeling so well -- "
Well, that's the line here. What is the constitutional right --
Well --
-- between the mother and the unborn child? Whose --
My --
-- constitutional rights matter more?
Right. My statement on that happens to be, you know, if the mother will die. And you're going to know that. And the problem with the life: If you say life, what does life mean? You have a cold and you're going to end up having an abortion. So I have the three exceptions and pretty much the standard three exceptions that many Republicans have.
You were pretty -- you were somewhat defending Planned Parenthood earlier this week. It struck me that there was a time Planned Parenthood was not seen as a very political organization. Were you ever a donor to Planned Parent --
I don't know. I mean, I don't know --
It's possible?
But it's possible. I give to so many, Chuck. I give to so many organizations over the years. Hundreds of millions of dollars. And so I don't know. I don't think so. But it's possible somewhere --
It wouldn't have surprised you if you had?
Well, it could be. Look, Planned Parenthood has to stop with the abortions. A lot of people consider it an abortion clinic. I think those tapes that I saw over the last -- the five tapes or the six tapes, I think they were outrageous. I think they were terrible, disgusting by any standpoint. And they have to stop.
Does it bother you that they --
At the same time --
-- were edited? Do you think they --
Well, I don't know about them being edited. All I did, I mean, whatever I saw was terrible --
It's what you saw.
I mean, it was terrible. And in particular, I didn't like the attitude of the people. They talked about it almost like we're making widgets or gadgets. And it was inappropriate.
So you would not shut down the -- you don't think there should be a government showdown, shutdown over Planned Parenthood funding --
I wouldn't fund it if they have the abortion going on. And it's been a big factor. Now, you hear all different numbers. They say it's 3%. Other people say it's 85%. That's a big difference. So I'd certainly look into it. We have to keep --
But would you shut down the government over this dispute?
I would not fund if they're doing abortions.
But as you know, there could be a stalemate in Congress. Is it worth shutting down the government over?
It's something I'd have to think about to be honest with you. I don't want to give a hard and fast answer to that. It bothers me greatly that they're doing the abortions. At the same time, women's health issues are, you know, very important to me.
Let's go foreign affairs. You want to knock the hell out of ISIS. How?
Well, I want to take away their wealth. And, as you know, for years I've been saying, "Don't go into Iraq." They went into Iraq. They destabilized the Middle East. It was a big mistake. OK, now we're there. And you have ISIS. And I said this was going to happen. I said, "Iran will take over Iraq, " which is happening as sure as you're sitting there. And ISIS is taking over a lot of the oil and certain areas of Iraq. And I said you take away their wealth, that you go and knock the hell out of the oil, take back the oil. We take over the oil, which we should have done in the first place. And --
It's going to take ground troops.
If you re --
Maybe 25,000 --
We can circle it. We can --
How ma --
-- circle it. We're going to have so much money. And what I would do with the money that we make, which would be tremendous, I would take care of the soldiers that were killed, the families of the soldiers that were killed, the soldiers, the wounded warriors that are -- I love them. And they're walking all over the streets of New York, all over the streets of every city without arms, without legs, and worse than that. And I would take care of them. They paid a big price --
So America should take over these oil fields. Shouldn't be given to the Iraqis?
Well, we can give them something. But we should definitely take back money for our soldiers. We've had soldiers that were decimated, so badly hurt, the wounded warriors, and killed of course. But we've had soldiers that were so badly hurt and killed. I want their families to get something. Because we got nothing out of that war. We spent $2 trillion, Chuck. We had thousands of people killed. Wounded warriors all over the place. They got nothing. And they can't even say we had a victory.
Who do you talk to for military advice right now?
Well, I watch the shows. I mean, I really see a lot of great -- you know, when you watch your show and all of the other shows and you have the generals and --
So you do the --
And you have certain people that you like --
But is there a go-to for you? You know --
Probably there are --
-- every presidential --
-- two or three --
-- candidate has a go-to --
Yeah, probably there are two or three. I mean, I like Bolton. I think he's, you know, a tough cookie, knows what he's talking about. Jacobs is a good guy --
Do you mean Ambassador John Bolton --
Yes. I think he's terrific --
You mean Colonel Jack Jacobs?
Colonel Jack Jacobs is a good guy. And I see him on occasion.
You wrote this in 2011 about Saudi Arabia. "It's the world's biggest funder of terrorism. Saudi Arabia funnels our petro dollars, our very own money, to fund the terrorists that seek to destroy our people while the Saudis rely on us to protect them." What are U.S.-Saudi relations going to look like under a Trump administration?
We --
-- that paid back some stuff --
We got nothing. And, you know, I met the Kuwaitis right after --
But to go back to Saudi Arabia, if they're a funder of terrorists, why should we have diplomatic relations with them at all?
Well, look, I'm not a big fan --
Should we be --
I'm just --
-- holding them more accountable?
Well, you know --
-- if we get paid --
-- by these extremely wealthy countries, yes --
It turns our --
We have --
Iran would still get money. I understand --
Can you believe that deal?
But let me ask you this.
No, no. Why is Iran --
I understand there's a lot of people --
-- getting the money?
I understand a lot of people are critical of the deal. But could you, what deal can you come up with that wouldn't give Iran money?
OK, I would --
No sanctions relief?
"We will never give you back your money. We will never -- "
What do you do on day one though?
OK, I've heard a lot of people say, "We're going to rip up the deal." It's very tough to do when you say, "Rip up a deal." Because I'm a deal person. And --
You get that --
-- when I --
Even if you've made --
When I make deals --
You've --
Let me tell you. But I will police that deal. You know, I've taken over some bad contracts. I buy contracts where people screwed up and they have bad contracts.
But you have to abide by it.
But I'm really good at looking at a contract and finding things within a contract that even if they're bad. I would police that contract so tough that they don't have a chance. As bad as the contract is, I will be so tough on that contract.
So the deal lives in a Trump administration --
Well, the deal --
You're just going to be --
It's very hard to say, "We're ripping up." And the problem is by the time I got in there, they will have already received the $150 billion. Do you know if the deal gets rejected they still get the money? Which is something I found out a week ago. I couldn't believe it. If the deal gets rejected, they still get all of this money. Iran is going to be unbelievably powerful and unbelievably rich. And Israel's in big trouble. Israel is in big trouble. Obama has really let Israel down.
So you believe the Saudis are going to get a nuclear weapon? You believe Egypt's going to after nuclear weapons --
I think other people will arm with nuclear weapons, yes, based on this deal. Because if you look at it, Iran will end up being nuclear. Even if it's not within the next fairly short period of time. And the whole thing about 24 days. First of all, the 24 days doesn't start immediately. There's a whole big deal before the clock starts ticking, right? So the 24 days could be much longer than that. In 24 days plus numerous weeks, you can do anything.
If you get evidence they're working on a nuclear weapon, you order air strikes immediately?
Yeah, I don't want to really say. I would be so tough you wouldn't believe. But I don't want to really say. You know, if I win -- and now I'm leading in every single poll. Even you will agree to that, right? Every single local --
You'll rescind that one, too?
One good thing about --
You'll rescind the DREAM Act executive order --
You're going to have to.
DACA?
We have to make a whole new set of standards. And when people come in, they have to come in legally --
So you're going to split up families?
Chuck.
You're going to deport children --
Chuck. No, no. We're going to keep the families together. We have to keep the families together.
But you're going to keep them together out --
But they have to go. But they have to go.
What if they have no place to go?
We will work with them. They have to go. Chuck, we either have a country or we don't have a country.
The cost of --
Either, we have a country --
-- doing this --
-- or not.
How do you do it?
The cost of doing it? Look at the cost of what we have right now.
But the cost of doing it.
Let me ask you this. Do you think there's --
I understand that. But how do you it?
Do you think there's tremendous cost for the illegals that are in here right now?
Of course there's cost to it.
OK, tremendous. Do you think there's tremendous crime being committed by illegals?
There's been some heinous ones.
And you see it all over. Just last night. All over. We will do it. And we will expedite it so people can come back in.
It's still not clear to me here --
Chuck, it'll work out so well. You will be so happy. In four years, you're going to be interviewing me and you're going to say, "What a great job you've done, President Trump."
Coming up, my lighting round with Donald Trump, including whether he believes President Obama is a U.S. citizen. And then there's this little nugget: I asked him why he felt it was necessary to constantly remind people that he attended the Wharton School of Finance. Here was his response.
Look, if I were a liberal Democrat, people would say I'm the super genius of all time. The super genius of all time. If you're a conservative Republican, you got to fight for your life. It's really an amazing thing.
We're talking about the birth certificate.
Maybe the hackers. Maybe the hackers have his records. No, I mean, his college records. I mean, he spent $4 million in legal fees to make sure that nobody ever saw --
Well, if you want him to release his --
So I'll tell you what --
-- would you release all of yours --
But here's what I'll do.
Would you release all your --
Here's what I'll do --
-- college transcripts --
I'm proud of my records. But he has to do it. If he does it, I'll do it.
So no lobbyists will work --
-- percent --
-- in the Trump administration?
I don't --
You'll have a ban?
I would certainly have a ban. Yeah, you can't put a lifetime ban. But you can certainly make it three, four years.
What is a fair living wage? What's fair?
I want to keep the minimum wage pretty much where it is right now.
You wouldn't raise it?
Because of the fact that we have a country that is now competing more than ever before because of airplanes, and transportation, and --
So you think we got to keep --
-- the internet --
We got to keep the minimum wage lower --
Well, we're not going to be able to compete with the rest of the world. I want to compete with the rest of the world. What I do want to do is bring in jobs so much so that people don't have to live on minimum wage. But we are going to have to compete with the rest of the world.
All right. Toss you a quick Facebook question. Michael Martinez asks, "Residents of the District of Columbia currently pay federal taxes but have only a non-voting delegate in the House of Representatives, no representation in the Senate. Should that policy continue as is? Should D.C. become a state? Should it not have to pay taxes? Should it be treated like Puerto Rico -- "
Well, bas --
"How should D.C. residents be treated -- "
I have a conflict of interest because I'm building the greatest -- you know, I'm building at the old post office I think what will be maybe one of the great hotels in the world --
So I've heard.
It'll open. And, by the way, unlike our government, we're under budget and ahead of schedule. Isn't that a nice thing to hear? You don't hear that. Just like the wall will be under budget and ahead of schedule. And nobody's getting through that wall. Believe me.
All right.
But --
So the district.
So I have a little bit of a conflict.
State or not?
I would like to do whatever is good for the District of Columbia because I love the people. You know, it's funny. I've really gotten to know the people, the representatives, and the mayor, and everybody. They're really special people. They're great. And they have a great feeling. So I would say whatever's best for them I'm for. I have a total conflict of interest.
Your slogan, we're going to hear it a lot today at the fair. "We're going to make America great again." When was the --
Great slogan.
When was the last time America was great?
I would say during the administration of Ronald Reagan you felt proud to be an American. You felt really proud. I don't think since then to any great extent people were proud.
I was just going to say --
Because look, NAFTA --
Let's not let --
NAFTA --
-- our great country be laughed at anymore. If that's the last time America was great again, you didn't think America was --
No, no --
-- great then.
I thought America was excellent. I think NAFTA was a huge mistake. I thought it was a terrible mistake. And, you know, but I just think that he set a tone that was an excellent tone for the country. I disagree --
Looking back, you seem to --
-- with some of his --
-- like it.
No, I just --
But at the time --
Well, looking back --
This was a fire --
-- I like him more.
This was a fiery guy.
Yeah, he's --
Donald J. Trump of 1987 was not --
Well, it's the same guy. If you think --
Your consistence on --
I have been consistent over the years --
I'll give you consistency. If you could win as an independent, would you be more comfortable running as an independent than as a Republican --
No, I want to run --
You probably couldn't win.
Yeah, it's more --
It's hard --
-- difficult. But it's not that. Look, somebody was asking me that question the other day times 50.
I understand --
All right? I mean, I'm hearing it all the time.
I know.
I'm running as a Republican. I'm leading by double digits for the most part --
So just stay, "I'm going to stay as a Republican." Why is that so hard?
Because I'm not prepared to close that door yet. But I wouldn't be surprised if someday in the not too distant future it happens. They are treating me very well. I just want to be treated fairly. And, you know, I'm a person that believes in leverage.
Alright. I sort of was amused about, this is a little excerpt from your Playboy interview in 1990. The questioner asks, "What is all of this?" -- meaning talking about your yacht, the bronze tower, the casino, what does it mean to you -- and you replied, "props for the show." And they said, "what show is that?" And you replied, "The show is Trump and its sold out performances everywhere."
And it has been for a long time.
Are we all a part of a show? I mean --
No...
-- there is, you know that some of the criticism that we feel like we're all part of a reality show?
No this is not a reality show. This is the real deal.
But --
Our country has to be --
You did smile when I read the show stuff.
I think it's fine --
You said yesterday...
So it's got...
In other words, the refugees, you'll help them.
A hundred percent.
You'll give food, water, medicine...
Oh, 100 percent.
-- lifeblood of how they fight terror now.
Right. So...
-- that they were given a stand down order.
Sure.
You know, I believe in the vetting process. I do. Now, the terrorists -- and I've been deploying for 10 years. The terrorists overseas utilize our strengths, with our compassion and empathy, against us.
True.
That what they're doing right now.
True.
Yes?
They should give the money back. And I've been saying this for a long time. They should give the money back.
This is important.
-- and do the job?
And you say you don't want to telegraph what...
I don't want to telegraph now...
All right, so let me follow-up on that.
Sean...
Yes?
-- this is a sick, sick deal.
But no, it's actually related, though, isn't it?
It's related. A little different, but it's related.
No, but 550 percent increase...
Right.
-- that Hillary wants in Syrian refugees. You're offering to provide a safe zone, protected militarily.
Paid for by somebody else.
A...
Doubled it.
-- so, but you'd also provide food, water, medicine, supplies, cots, baby formula?
Right. You'd take it...
Yes.
They have plenty of land, that I can tell you. But in Syria, there's plenty of money, because you look at the Gulf states, you like at the kind of money they have, there's nobody seen money like that. And they're not doing anything.
All right, last question --
They're not doing anything.
How dangerous is the Syrian refugees? And is it a better idea -- I'm talking as if you're not here, hi. No, but 550 percent increase that Hillary wants in Syrian refugees, you're offering to provide a safe zone, protected militarily...
Paid for by somebody else.
Everybody has got advice for you?
Everybody, right, everybody.
Do you think it's better not to talk about that?
Look, let me just say, she's totally protected. I've never seen anything like it.
By the media.
And she doesn't really do that much. She'll give a speech on teleprompter, and then she'll disappear. I don't know if she goes home -- she goes home and goes to sleep. I think she sleeps.
Take weekends off.
I guess she takes a lot of weekends off. She takes a lot of time off. And you know that's, frankly -- frankly, it's really not fair.
You know, I look at -- I've asked you a lot about the economy. We've got the lowest labor participation rate since the '70s.
Yes, right.
I'm running out of time. So when you say...
It gets built.
And you will rebuild the military, that's a promise?
We have to rebuild, it's all depleted. The military is depleted.
And you will send education back to the states.
One hundred percent.
And you will make America energy independent. Can you do it in four years?
It could be done faster than that. We have regulations that are absolutely destroying our energy companies.
Mr. Trump, thank you for being here. I'm retired law enforcement officer from the state of New Jersey.
Good place.
Donald Trump, welcome back to "Fox and Friends."
Good morning.
Good morning to you. Let's talk about the -- the Clinton Foundation. Among the people saying it's problematic and shut it down is Huffington Post. You -- you also agree with that -- with that premise.
Well, number one, they should shut it down. Number two, they should give the money back to a lot of countries that we shouldn't be taking and they shouldn't be taking money from, countries that influence her totally, and also, countries that discriminate against women and gays and everybody else. I mean, that money should be -- it should be given back. They should not take that money.
Honestly, do you think that will happen?
It should happen. Whether or not it will -- they're very greedy people, so maybe it won't. But it should happen.
So you say shut it down?
I say shut it down.
Mr. Trump, let's talk about her email scandal because she totally threw Colin Powell under the bus. She was meeting with the FBI and she said that Colin Powell told her to use her personal email server. So she's blaming it all on him. He was in the Hamptons over the weekend and he said that is a total lie. He said she was using that email for one year before he told her that he had been doing the same thing.
Well, look, she's a liar. I mean, she lies. She lied about the email, she lied about Colin Powell. I saw that, he was not happy. And it's -- the whole thing is a scam with them. Everything is a scam. Like grifters.
Of course, if this was a story that involved somebody with the last name of Trump, it would be a big story in the mainstream media, but because it's on the political left, not so much, right?
If this were Trump, it would be so big. It would be -- you would call up and you would say, I'm so sorry for you, isn't that sad.
So you're not flip flopping?
No, I'm not flip flopping. We want to come up with a really fair, but firm answer. It has to be very firm. But we want something fair.
Mr. Trump, thanks for joining us. I know you're heading to Austin tomorrow for another town hall and I will be there. So thanks for that interview and for joining us this morning.
That's great.
Appreciate it.
See you tomorrow.
Joining us now from Akron, Ohio, is Donald Trump. The media as you know are running wild with of this. Are you really rethinking your mass deportation strategy?
I just want to follow the law. What I'm doing is following the law. You know, this was for that, we have a great meeting over the weekend with Hispanics and leaders of the Hispanic community. And we discussed a lot of different things. And this was one of the many things that was discussed. And one of the groups, one of the media outlets that have gotten everything about me wrong, including the fact that I would never run and the reporter actually said he would give up his salary if he did. I don't think I have ever held him to that. But one of these media outlets said that they had word from one of the people it turned out to be false. In fact, the people all denied it, Bill and I think you probably have seen that but --
All right. But I want to get on the record once again.
We had a great -- well, let me explain to you. We had a great meeting with Hispanic leaders.
OK. But here's what everybody wants to know --
Do it very humane manner.
OK.
We want to do it in a very humane manner.
You will going to have to go through the court system when you deport as they have to do now. You're going to add federal judges, you're going to have to do a lot of things to make this thing efficient. Also, and here's the crux of the whole matter and you know this. The actual seizure of human beings, taking them from their homes and putting them in a detention center so that their illegal alien status can be adjudicated.
You don't have to put them in a detention center. Bill, you are the first one to mention detention center. You don't have to put them in a detention center.
All right. So, you wouldn't do that, you keep them in their homes.
No, I never said. I am not even heard the term. I am not going to put them in a detention center.
Well, he rounded them up. He took them out. And so when you cited him as an example of someone that you emulate --
No, I said that --
-- that's what the conclusion is.
I said that it's something that has been done at a very strong manner. I don't agree with that. I'm not talking about detention centers. I have very, very good relationships with a lot of people, a lot of Hispanic people. We are talking about it. We are going to get rid of the bad ones. The bad ones are going to be out of here fast. And you know there are a plenty of bad ones, gang members, gang leaders.
Sure. Absolutely.
You look at Los Angeles, you see what's happening.
Right.
They are going out, they are going to be out of here so fast, your head will spin. As far as the rest, we are going to go through the process like they are now perhaps with a lot more energy and we're going to do it only through the system of laws.
OK. Good. Now, I want to play you --
And by the way, Bill, that are in existence.
So, how? You have in Chicago a problem that, did you know that murders in Chicago are up 50 percent this year from last year?
I know. I know it very well. It's out of control.
And they can't solve it. They can't solve it. State of Illinois, city of Chicago can't do it. Right?
Well, you know why they can't solve it because they don't have the right people in charge.
I know. All right. So, specifically, specifically, how do you do it? How do you do it?
I know police in Chicago. If they were given the authority to do it, they would get it done.
How? How?
You have unbelievable -- how? By being very much tougher than they are right now. They right now are not tough. I mean, I could tell you this very long and quite boring story. But when I was in Chicago, I got to meet a couple of very tough police. I said, how do you stop this? How do you stop this? If you were put in charge to a specific person, do you think you could stop this? He said, Mr. Trump I would be able to stop it in one week and I believed him 100 percent.
How? Did he tell you how he would be able to stop this?
No. It's just -- he wants to use tough, he wants to use tough police tactics.
But you have to have a warrant to arrest people.
You have people being killed.
You can't beat them up. You have to have a warrant to arrest them. You have to --
All I know is this. I went to a top police officer in Chicago who is not the police chief, and he -- I could see by the way he was dealing with his people, he was a rough, tough guy, they respected him greatly. I said, how do you think you do it? He said Mr. Trump, within one week we could stop much of this horror show that's going on.
But he didn't tell you exactly precisely how.
No, I didn't ask him. Because I'm not the mayor of Chicago. But I'll tell you what. I sent his name in and I said you probably should hire this guy. Because you have, you know, the expression you have nothing to lose. Look at what's going on in Chicago. It's horrible. This guy felt totally competent that he could stop it at a very short period of time.
So, nationwide --
It's a little bit like we could win the war a lot quicker if we would let our generals do the job properly. This was a man --
But you have to have a strategy. What I'm trying to get is you have to have a strategy.
I'm sure he has got a strategy.
OK. But you're going to be, if you are a president, you're going to have to have your strategy. So, let's just take a very micro issue, attacks on police. All right? So they are rising because they are being police officers in some places are being demonized and now, unstable people.
People are being coddled.
OK. All right.
People are being coddled.
So, you are president. So how are you going to stop attacks on police in the present climate?
Well, first of all, we need somebody that is going to be a cheerleader for the police to an extent. Right now I just left the Akron police and some other people. And they are terrific people and they feel like they are being left behind by our leadership. They are not being respected by our leadership and they literally don't have spirit. They lose their spirit. Every time something happens, it's the police's fault. Look --
Your tone is pro-police.
You have to have --
How do you stop the bad guys from attacking them?
By giving them back their spirit and by allowing them to go and counter attack. I mean, it's ridiculous what's happening. They are not respecting the police anymore. And the police are afraid to do anything. I have spoken to so many police. I mean, I have gotten to know them. I have endorsements from, like almost everybody in terms of police and law enforcement. And I have spoken to so many and they are afraid to do anything because they don't want to lose their job. They don't even want to talk to people anymore because they're afraid that something will happen. That will be the end of their job, their pension, their family, the whole thing. They are petrified to act.
Are you going to make governors like Cuomo in your state of New York? Are you going to change their minds about their liberal policies that due on Mayor De Blasio in the city in which you live? That, you know, he almost encourages bad behavior toward police. That mayor. How are you ever going to change a Governor Cuomo or De Blasio.
Well, first of all, De Blasio is been a terrible mayor. The police have no respect for him whatsoever. They just like him tremendously. And in fact, for a period of time, a long period of time, and they would like to do it again, they turn their back whenever he speaks. I mean, they literally turn their back when he speaks.
How are you going to change him when change his policies?
They're going to have to change themselves. All I can do is, from the top, I would be very, very strong in terms of being a cheerleader for the police. They do a great job and they are not recognized for it. And when they do have a problem, when something happens, whether it's a rogue cop which can happen or whether somebody makes a mistakes it's on your show and every show for the next two weeks. It's very unfair. I was saying the other day, they can do 200,000 great acts. Two hundred thousand. And one bad one, whether it's, again, bad or whether it's a mistake --
Sure.
Who knows, and it's on the evening news for two weeks.
That's an excellent point.
Talk about the 200,000 good things.
The media has been derelict as well.
Maybe we have to let the people know the good aspects of the police --
OK.
-- which nobody wants to cover.
OK.
Frankly, with the email scandal I don't even know how she is able to run.
It's because people don't pay that close attention. But anyway, let's get back to your campaign staff. When you are president, if you win, you will going to have to put together a staff. All right? Of people to advise you and help you run the nation. Now you have turned over two guys in less than six months. Now, would it be fair to say that your judgment about those two men wasn't good? Would that be unfair?
In the meantime in my company, I have had people for many, many years. And I have done that. I just wanted to make this change. I felt very comfortable with the people that I had. I'd like them for a long time. And I wanted to make this change for a while and I made it. You know, we have like three months to go and I wanted to make sure that it was something that I wanted and I like these people. I have always felt comfortable and I decided to do it.
OK. Now, the debate is going to be everything, you know that right? The polls now whether the "L.A. Times " has you ahead by 10 or two or you're behind 85 or it doesn't matter. The first debate is going to be the super bowl of debates. All right? So you and Hillary Clinton, all right? And everybody is going to be watching, even the pinheads who don't watch will hear about it and they will see it on the internet after the fact.
Right.
All right. You understand that this is make or break, right? The debate. It's make or break?
Well, I think it's going to be very important. I don't know if it's make or break. But I have done well in the debates. I had 17 people in the debates. And, you know, I'm the one that survived. And I have enjoyed the debating process. I never debated before professionally or as a politician because I was never a politician before. But we had 11 debates that I participated in and according to everybody I did very well.
All right. Now, are you going to call her Crooked Hillary during the debate? Are you going to do that or are you going to keep it at an issue-based?
Well, I'm not going to say what I'm going to be doing but I will be doing what I will be doing and she is going to do what she is going to do and we'll see what happens.
But you must be preparing, right? I'm sure you have people in your organization that are preparing, you are preparing now. You are going to have stacks of research and there has got to be ways in which to go. I'm just trying to get the tone and of course that could change in 30 days. But the tone right now is that you are going to be the guy you were in the Republican, you know, boom, take no prisoners or are you going to be a little bit more measured?
Well, I don't really want to really say that. I'm not sure exactly which way I'm going to go but I may be the way I was and I may be a much different person. I can't tell you that.
All right.
I don't think I would tell you. You know, what? If I knew I don't think I would tell you frankly but it will be an interesting hour and a half.
It will. I can't wait. I can't wait.
Pretty big audience. Almost as big as THE O'REILLY FACTOR.
Well, you should have me moderate the debate.
That's OK with me.
Then it's gloves off.
I bet you would be fair, too.
Sure.
And it's very unfair. No. I don't think so. I think I have done very well. I think frankly the media and you know this because you have cover it all the time. In the history of politics, there has never been a more hostile media than to Donald Trump. So, they will take a perfectly good statement that I make, dice it up, chop it up and then cover it for three days solid on some the networks. FOX does a little bit but not too much.
You are maybe right about that.
And I think we did very well. And I think the last week and I think you have seen this. I think the last week has been the best week that I ever had from the beginning and that starts with the primaries and most people have said that that the last week --
Trump! Trump! Trump!
A lot of people.
You've got a lot of people.
A lot of good people.
That was 2015.
Yes. On June 16th of last year, when I talked about illegal immigration, a lot of people didn't know what I was talking about. And we started a dialogue. I took a lot of heat, you know that.
According to the crowd, when...
When, yes.
Let me ask you this, Vicente Fox and this -- by the way, the current president of Mexico said he would meet with you. Will you meet with him?
Yes, sure. I'd meet with him.
You would?
Absolutely, I'd meet with him.
All right. But I know this question has come up a lot, what about people that work hard, have been here a long time, they own homes, they have their property, and this is a question everyone is going to want answered, what about them, do they have to go back or would you reconsider them?
We are going to follow the laws of the country.
So they're going to have to go back.
We are going to follow the law. And we're going to see who people are. We're going to see how they've done. Do you believe in a merit system, Sean, when people come in, as an example? Do you believe in a merit system?
Sure.
One of the things that's very unfair with leaving people is that you have years and years of people waiting on line, they've gone through a process, and they've...
They've filed.
Legally, they've filed and they're great people in some cases, I guess in some cases maybe not. But you have really great people wanting and so proudly wanting to come into our country, and now what you'd be doing is you'd take people away from that line. And it's really sort of unfair...
Is there any part of the law that you might be able to change that would accommodate those people that contribute to society, have been law-abiding, have kids here, would there be any room in your mind or are you -- because I know you had a meeting this week.
I did.
Yes, but Obama doesn't follow them.
Yes, they don't follow them. But we're going to follow the laws.
In the setup piece for this show, you speak passionately about this. And you have met many mothers and fathers.
I have. I have.
What is your promise to them if you're elected?
Well, look, all we can say, because the loss is beyond anything that we can even...
What else is part of this? We're going to do -- when it comes to future one visa students? One of the things, and I think this is interrelated, the whole issue of what you call extreme vetting.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Might as well let the police do their job.
All right, Mr. Trump, here, here's the most important question. Everything together you're convinced we can stop all the illegal immigration and, from those countries where they practice Sharia, when you...
Boom. Out.
Judicial Watch found another nearly 15,000 of them. Hillary, about half of the people that she met with as Secretary of State, including the Crown Prince of Bahrain, were given access because they're big Clinton Foundation donors. You have called for a Special Prosecutor. Tell us what, what your thoughts are. Do you believe this is pay-to-play?
Well, this is brand new that you're just telling me this. And I'm not that surprised, but that's a tremendous thing when you hear over half of the people. Is that what you said?
When you --
If you trace it back, you're going to find out that they got plenty.
We met victims' families last night -- or families of victims. You want to build the wall. You're going to build that wall within two years?
It's not a question of wanting. We have no choice.
What do you think the right height would be?
The drugs, the drugs come over, and the cash goes back.
Right. That means they go back.
We have to follow the laws. Now can we be -- and I'll ask the audience, you have somebody who is terrific, who has been here...
... think they should go through a process that maybe give them a chance. Clap, we've ought to hear you.
How many people
That's important because -- so you're saying there is -- and you have been sort of indicating that there will be some flexibility that originally you had said they're all out and there was a big brouhaha, but you're saying that if somebody can prove that they've been here, proven to be a citizen -- but wait, here's the big question though.
Go ahead.
Here's -- let me throw a statistic into the mix here if you all don't mind. All right, so illegal immigrants, we have 95 million Americans right now out of the labor force.
Right.
There's one other aspect to this and then we've got to go to break. And that is, your extreme vetting.
Extreme. Extreme vetting.
So, really what you're saying is you'll empower them, give them the support they need to fulfill the agenda?
They want to do the job, they know the job better than anybody. You can do reports, you can hire people to do studies, these people know better than anybody what has to be done.
There's a YouTube video. Remember, I went to meet you and Eric on, on an unrelated matter, and there's a woman that works for you. She happens to be a black American, African-American woman, and she did this whole video about you. I asked her to come on my show, and she's like, oh, I'm not going on TV. Did you see that video?
I did. She was terrific. And a terrific woman. And works actually with Don and Eric. And she's a fantastic woman. I was so proud of her when I saw her on television.
In North Carolina, you did something that made a lot of news. You said, yeah, I regret some of the things that I said. What's the na -- the problems of the country are far too important to get distracted. And that took a lot of people by surprise.
Well, I do, I regret things I like in life. You know, everything you...
Do you regret Lyin' Ted? No, I'm kidding.
Well, I...
Would you like your kids to be in the White House with you, if you become President?
Well, I think what they we do is probably stay back and run the business. I'll have nothing to do with it whatsoever.
Oh, unlike Hillary.
I couldn't care less about it. We have such a job to do.
Mr. Trump, I think she hit on a very important point. Disproportionately because of illegal immigration, 95 million Americans out of the labor force, the black and Hispanic communities have been hurt the most. And not only are they competing for jobs, it's driving wages way down.
Hundred percent.
That's a big part of the equation.
A lot of the people in this room, as an example, their wages are lower now than they were 18 years ago. Think of that. And they're working two jobs in many cases, largely in some cases due to Obamacare. And that should not be. We're getting older and we're working harder and we're making less. That can't be.
But 11 million people are no longer going to be deported.
I've had people say it's a hardening, actually.
But 11 million who have not committed a crime...
No, no. We're then going to see.
There's going to be a path to legalization, is that right?
You know it's a process. You can't take 11 at one time and just say boom, you're gone. We have to find where these people are. Most people don't even know where they are. Nobody even knows if it's 11. It could be 30 or and it could be 5. Nobody knows what the number is.
But isn't that...
No, it's not.
But that's Jeb Bush's policy. I mean, essentially...
I don't know anything about Jeb Bush. He wasn't building a wall. Jeb Bush wasn't building a wall. Jeb Bush wasn't making strong borders. And I'm not knocking Jeb Bush, but I was with him for a long time.
Right. But he was mocked for saying that, look, you can't deport 11 million people. And it now seems like, I know you're not really focusing on it, but...
First, I want to see what's going to happen. We are going to deport many people, many, many people, the bad ones.
The vast majority of those 11 million are not criminals.
Well, we don't know that. We're going to find out who they are. We have crime all over this country.
So if they haven't committed a crime, is there going to be a path to legalization? I'm talking about citizenship.
First thing we're going to do -- no. There is not a pass. There is no path to legalization.
You talked about paying back taxes on "Hannity."
Unless people leave the country -- well, when they come back in, if they come back in, then they can start paying taxes.
So they still have to leave the country?
But there is no path to legalization, unless they leave the country and come back.
So that means of the 11 million who are here even if they haven't committed a crime...
Well, you don't know. Again, you keep saying 11 million. You don't know what the number is. You know, millions of people...
Well, however many, that's the estimate.
... and using the existing laws of our country, using the existing laws, millions of people are deported every year.
Right.
You know that, right? You know, people don't talk about that. It's Obama. They don't talk about that.
But how is she bigoted? Bigoted is having hatred toward a particular group.
Well, because she's selling them down the tubes. Because she's not doing anything for those communities. She talks a good game but she doesn't do anything.
So you're saying she has hatred or dislike of black people?
Her policies are bigoted. Her policies are bigoted because she knows they're not going to work.
Do you think she personally is bigoted?
Well, she is. Of course, she is. Her policies. They're her policies, she comes out with the policies and others that believe like she does also. But she came out with policies over the years. This is over the years, a long time. She's totally bigoted. There's no question about that. Look at what...
But hatred is at the core of that, or dislike of African-Americans?
Well, or maybe she's lazy. I don't know what it is. All I can tell you is I've been hearing the same stuff from her and others for years and the inner cities today are worse than they ever have been.
Have you always thought she was bigoted though? I mean, you were supporter of hers in the past.
Honestly I never thought of it. I never thought of it. As a business person I never thought of it. I got along with all politicians.
One of the things you've been saying recently in talking to African-Americans, addressing them in large rallies, is saying what have you got to lose? What the hell have you got to lose?
Absolutely. That's the way I look at it.
The way you're been categorizing, though, we've been, you know, interviewing a lot of African-American voters, some of them are insulted by some of the language you've been using.
I don't think they are. I think if they actually heard me they wouldn't be insulted at all. I actually say to them...
Well, you're saying you get shot on your street...
Excuse me...
... you don't have jobs, you don't have schools.
Well, that's the fact. They're shot on their streets. Look at Chicago.
But for the vast majority of African-Americans, that's not -- I mean, the vast majority do not live in poverty.
Forty percent are living in poverty, would you say that's a pretty big...
Twenty-six percent.
Ah well, I have 40. I have a different stat than you do.
The Kaiser Foundation has 26 percent.
I have 40 percent, whether it's 26 or 40, look, you can look at it any way, and I know you want to protect her as much as you possibly can.
Some of your African-American supporters that we've talked to say they would like you to go into an African-American church, or directly talking to...
I'm going to do that very soon. In fact, I'm going to Detroit and I'll be going to some other places. I've been invited to many. I'll be doing that very soon.
So that's definitely something you are going to do?
Oh, I'm going to do it, yes, sure. I look forward to it. In fact, I think I'm doing it over the next two weeks, I'm doing a couple of visits.
I want to read you one more thing that she just said today in her speech. She said: "This is what I want to make clear today, a man with a long history of racial discrimination, who traffics in dark conspiracy theories drawn from the pages of supermarket tabloids and the far reaches of the internet should never run our government or command our military."
Well, it's an incorrect statement. First of all, we were sued many, many years ago when I was very young by the government, sued many, many companies. You know that. It wasn't me. They sued many companies.
You settled.
They bring up the case. I settled, but no awards, no nothing.
Thanks for joining us tonight, Mr. Trump.
Well, thank you, Kimberly.
And you are saying, why not give you a shot in the Republican Party. What do they have to lose? That seems to be resonating to people.
I always say it. I say I will do a great job. Give me a shot. I will do a great job. But you watch, I will do a fantastic job: security, education, jobs. Nobody is going to be able to do it like I'm going to do it.
All right. Mr. Trump, thank you so much for being with us here tonight and going ON THE RECORD.
Thank you very much, Kimberly.
He was on the show in the studio with me about 15 years ago and now I welcome him as the Republican nominee for president of the United States. Mr. Trump, thanks for your time.
That's right, I remember. It was about 15 years ago. That's a long time, but I still remember.
We spent a lot of time talking about our kids and about family and I saw a different side of you that I think a lot of potential voters have not seen yet.
Well, family is so important to me and it should be important to everybody, but nothing like family. With all the success and everything else, nothing like family, Dori.
We'll get back to that in a minute, let's talk about some of the issues here. You're coming to the Seattle area Tuesday night, Everett to be exact. Why are you spending time and energy here in Washington state when it is one of the bluest-of-blue states and appears to be unflippable?
Well, it's true, but we seem to have a great receptivity there. We've gotten very good numbers from other states where we're sort of in the same position. And we are doing... I guess I'm a little bit different kind of candidate, frankly. I am in Los Angeles and different parts of California, I said, 'Let's go up.' Our senator over there, as you know, we've had tremendous support from some of the people in Washington state and I said I would do it and I hear they're going to have a very big turnout. So I said on the way back I will be doing it, I'll stay there. I love the state, I have so many friends there and I said, let's do it. Who knows if it's the right thing or the wrong thing, but as far as I'm concerned, it's the right thing to do because I have always loved the state.
You talk about things that should be keenly interesting to voters here because immigration is such a major issue. I know you're giving a major speech on that later this week. Washington is a border state. Our border is with Canada. Eventually, would we need a wall between the U.S. and Canada?
Well, I think it's unlikely, to be honest with you. A lot of good things are gonna happen with Washington state if the politicians are careful. But you'd better be careful because you know what's going on with Boeing and Boeing is building massive facilities in China and then they'll drop their currency and they'll start devaluations as they always do and they'll start taking your business away and you won't have much of Boeing.... If I'm president, that won't happen but, believe me, they're looking to get your businesses out of there and you know how bad the trade deals have been for Washington state, because they're very unfair deals. Now you live with them but we should do more than live with them, but the deals have been very, very unfair, the trade deals that have been made.
You've talked a lot about the trade deals. What could you do specifically to keep Boeing from outsourcing?
Well, look, basically you have to create something where other countries -- and mostly it's countries -- but other countries are not devaluing their currency. You look at what's going on with China, you look what's going on with other countries that are competitors of ours, and competitors, in a sense, of Boeing, and they make it impossible for your companies and your local companies to compete. And before you know it, they won't even be making the planes in Seattle, they won't even be making the planes in the state of Washington. You watch. Hopefully, I get in so you won't have that problem, but if I don't get in, I guarantee you someday you'll be calling, you'll be saying, 'I remember when this guy, Trump, was saying this is exactly what was going to happen.' And you'll see. Look at what's going on with China, look at the facilities they're building over there, so you better be very careful because they're looking to take your business.
Another issue that you talk about that's critically important to our region is sanctuary citizens. Seattle is a sanctuary city, Washington is a de facto sanctuary state. We see the real-life repercussions. There was an English illegal here a few year ago. He got pulled over by the police in a traffic stop, they didn't ascertain his immigration status. A couple weeks later, he walked on the campus of the University of Washington, shot and murdered an ex-girlfriend. When you see that this guy had actually been pulled over by the police and they couldn't determine his status, we start to see the real-life consequences of what you're talking about there.
That's one of thousands of instances. It's all over the country, and sanctuary cities are out. Basically, they're just a way of protecting people coming in and in many cases and you have people that are being protected that shouldn't be allowed in our country, that are at the highest level of criminal element -- they're killers -- and sanctuary cities are out. And not only that, our police force, when they hear about sanctuary cities or when they hear they're illegal immigrants, they don't even fight the same way because they feel there is nothing they can do. There's just nothing they can do. It's just so unfair to the families of those that... I mean you have people who are being killed by such large numbers and we can't allow it to happen. And sanctuary cities are over.
Is this a state's rights issue or is this something that you think the federal government can mandate. How do you do that?
The federal government is going to have to get involved and they're going to have to get involved very sharply because the crime is incredible that's coming out over our borders and the federal government is going to have to get involved.
Other issues in the news today. The Obama administration today said they are ahead of schedule and have now admitted 10,000 Syrian refugees. A lot of governors have said no. The governor of our state, Jay Inslee, said we will welcome as many Syrian refugees as possible. Can they be properly vetted and does this present a security risk to states like ours?
The answer is very simple: No, it cannot and they cannot be properly vetted and it's shocking that your governor is enthusiastically accepting these people. All you have to do is look at Germany and look at different countries in Europe, and look all over, and look at the disaster that's taking place. Take a look at Germany, take a look at Paris and take a look at Nice and so many other places. Look at Belgium.... Many governors refuse and they fight very hard, they fight as hard as you can fight not to allow this to happen. And you're right, Obama wants it to happen and Hillary Clinton wants it to happen and Trump will not allow it to happen for a minute.
A couple other quick things in the news today. Huma Abedin announced she is splitting from Anthony Weiner. I know you released a statement about this earlier today. Huma Abedin's relationship, does it reflect on your opponent, Hillary Clinton?
Terribly. I said a long time ago that she's married to a guy who is a disaster. I've known him for a long time. Here's a guy who, what he's done over the internet is disgusting and he's a pervert and just a very sick guy and she is married to him. And, you know, by the way, take a look at where she worked, by the way, and take a look at where her mother worked and works. You take a look at the whole event. But in the case of Anthony Weiner, she's married to a guy who is uncontrolled and uncontrollable. He's a sick person and she has access to classified information. Huma Abedin has access to classified information. How Hillary got away with that one, nobody will ever know. But to think that it's very likely that much of this information, Anthony Weiner would know about and I think that's something that was terrible. At the same time, knowing Weiner, I think Huma Abedin did a very, very smart thing when she finally decided to leave him. Very smart. She had no choice.
I'm amazed because everybody talks about the gender gap in this campaign and yet you have Hillary Clinton and Abedin who surround themselves with men who degrade them. I say this as a husband and father of three daughters: I don't understand people surrounding themselves with people who degrade them like that.
Well, he's a sick person, he's a sick person. It just happened and it's actually sad in many ways. He's a very sick guy and, if you look back, you'll see that I said, at the beginning, the worst thing she can do is marry this guy. Because he's a politician, I've known him for quite a while and I understood that he had difficulties. And certainly when it came out, I don't know if these people get cured, it doesn't seem like it, but for him to have -- in this position that he's in -- to have done it again, and this time with a... little baby at his side, is hard to comprehend. Hard to comprehend.
Are you following 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick refusing to stand for the anthem? He had bad things to say about both you and Hillary.
I have followed it and I think it's personally not a good thing, I think it's a terrible thing. And maybe he should find a country that works better for him, let him try. It won't happen.
Last thing, we started off talking about family. I was in Cleveland and came away from that convention saying that I thought one of your greatest strengths was your kids, who I thought hit home runs. Dad-to-dad -- and for every parent who's listening -- your kids weren't on rich kids of Instagram, and they aren't covered with tattoos and they got good educations. What would you say is the quality as a father and with their moms that produced what seems to be a pretty good group of kids?
Well, they're very good kids and they work very hard, and I love what they do, but they are smart and they went to good schools and good colleges and they did well as students. But I've always told them, 'No drugs, no alcohol, no cigarettes.' I'd always tell them that, from the time they were very young. No drugs, no alcohol, no cigarettes. If you can keep them away from the drugs and the alcohol, you're giving them a tremendous boost in life because so many young kids, smart kids, good kids (are) there but they're hooked. And if you can keep them away from the drugs and alcohol, they will have a tremendous advantage in life.
I appreciate you taking the time. I hope you have a fantastic time in Everett. I think you'll have a good turnout.
We're going to have a lot of fun and again, so many people that are coming that know me and I hear we're going to have a fantastic group of people so I look forward and I hope to see you there.
Mr. Trump I want to thank you for this interview with the Impact Television Network my first question is: Are you a Christian and do you believe that the bible is an inspired word of God?
Yes and yes. My mother was such a strong influence on me early on. I still carry and cherish the Bible she gave me. As I went through my life, things got busy with business but my family kept me grounded to the Truth and the Word of God. My children mean the world to me, and seeing them grow into productive adults brought me back to my faith. I treasure my relationship with my family and through them, I have a strong faith enriched by an ever-wonderful God.
Mr. Trump there is racial divide in our country and it is evident that the tension is boiling over. Case and point Reverend Pinckney in South Carolina was gunned down when a white young man came into their Bible Study and slaughtered the Reverend and eight other individuals because he wanted to start a race war. What would your administration do to bring down the racial tension that is in our Country? In the Bible Jesus said that a house divided cannot stand.
Our best hope for erasing racial tensions in America is to work toward a color-blind society. In business, we hire, retain and award based on merit. In society, however, we have divisions that can only be eliminated if we have equal opportunity and then equal access to programs and institutions that will lift all people in the country. We have to reform our tax system so that we can spur economic growth for the long haul. We have to have stronger enforcement of immigration laws. We have to renegotiate our trade deals so that we can bring advantage back to the American workforce. But perhaps most important is that we must provide equal opportunity for a quality education for all Americans. The higher the educational attainment, the greater the likelihood one can climb the economic ladder. We must bring school choice programs to our cities and we must get rid of Common Core. We must make sure that access, affordability and accountability are brought into our higher education system. Without a focus on educational outcomes for every American, we will perpetuate the permanent underclass that progressive policies have sustained. Republicans like me need to have the courage to speak the truth about where we are and what has to be done. We have to have the courage to go into communities and work with everyone there to make sure that our schools are good and that our children have access to the whatever educational situation they may need. This is not something one person can do, but it is something that we can do together.
Mr. Trump every law abiding African American believes in and supports our law enforcement agencies. If there is a problem in our community, the police are the first ones that we call. In Wisconsin on August 16, 2016 you stated that there would be law and order for everyone. We've seen many cities in turmoil this year over police shootings of un-armed black men. Case and point we have Philando Castile who was reaching for his identification and in turn was shot and killed by an officer, you even made the statement that something didn't look right in that situation. We then have Charles Kinsey, the caregiver for the autistic man who was shot by an officer while both his hands and feet were raised, and another example is Walter Scott the man who was shot in the back while running away. These are great concerns in our community. What will you do to reform the policing system, to protect both cops and citizens? What is your take on black lives matter?
Policing is, for the most part, a local issue and must be dealt with at the local level. We have too many people asking that we move to a nationalized police force, which is not appropriate for America. What I can do as President is make sure that we provide the resources necessary to state and local authorities to have the best training and equipment possible. My Attorney General will reach out to the state and local law enforcement agencies to make sure that we, from a national perspective, provide as much support to these agencies as possible. The higher the quality of our law enforcement officers the lower the chances of horrible outcomes in our communities. The real burden here must rest squarely on the shoulders of those leaders in each and every community around the country. Only through building trust can we make sure that each community is as safe as possible.
Mr. Trump I have a 3-year-old grandson who is afraid of the police. What kind of Justice Department would you have to encourage and train the good officers and remove the ones who are not only taking innocent black lives but the lives of innocent people just because they wear a badge?
Ag ain, you are asking the President to move toward nationalizing the police. This should not be pursued by any chief executive of the country. What I should do as President is to make sure that state and local authorities have as much support as can be mustered by the federal government. As President, I will work tirelessly to make the life of every American safer and more prosperous. If we work together to make our communities stronger and more resilient, we will be able to lift all Americans to better lives.
Mr. Trump there is a perception that your administration is racist. With many of the African American voters their belief is that the Republican Party as a whole does not cater to African American needs. In 2008 and 2012 we had two Republican Candidates John McCain and Mitt Romney and neither one of them came to Detroit, or any urban area that I can remember to even address the concerns of our community. First I would like to commend you for coming to our community as a Republican Candidate. Second I need to know how would you change that perception in our community?
The proof, as they say, will be in the pudding. Coming into a community is meaningless unless we can offer an alternative to the horrible progressive agenda that has perpetuated a permanent underclass in America. We need to be true to our word and offer all Americans more opportunities so that each and every one of them can reach their full potential. This means economic policies that will bring jobs back to America and will raise wages for all. This means working hard to provide as many educational options as possible to our parents and children. This means cleaning up drugs and making our neighborhoods and communities safer. We need to get people off welfare and back to work. We need to make sure that anyone who qualifies can go into a bank, get a loan and then start a business. We need to reduce regulations and expand options for people who want to be independent of government. We need to make sure that people can worship how they want and where they want without worrying that some federal agency is going to threaten the religious liberties. Republicans have better options. We just need to have the courage to present them with conviction.
Mr. Trump as a Pastor for 30 years in our community I have seen single mothers trying to make it off of minimum wage salaries. I have seen African American men who are trying to work and do what is right but because of their having a record with a felony on it they are unable to find employment. The gap is now at its biggest ever, with a recent report saying it would take 228 years for African Americans to achieve the average wealth of white families. "Report by Corporation for Enterprise Development". What would you do to help level the playing field financially for African-Americans? How will you use your business acumen to help create more quality jobs in the inner cities? And what is your view on raising the average minimum wage?
Let's deal with the minimum wage first. This should be a state issue where the states can set an appropriate minimum wage based on state and local conditions. More than half the states already have minimum wages above the federal mandate. Should there be an increase in the federally mandated minimum wage? Yes, there probably should be some adjustment. I will work with Congress to find the best possible solution to this complex issue. As for improving the economic lot of African Americans, we again must take the long-term view. We must get tax reform, trade reform and immigration reform. We must make sure that we create educational opportunities for everyone. We must create enterprise zones in targeted communities and we must make our neighborhoods and communities as safe as possible. Opportunities that allow every single person to reach his or her highest potential is the long term solution for every American.
Mr. Trump the African American Church has always been the cornerstone of their community. In my opinion the black Pastors have a pulse on the community that they serve. African-Americans do not view your campaign as one of diversity, if you're elected President, what will you do to ensure that you have a diverse cabinet and advisers that can speak to the real needs of the African American community? Would you consider having a group of African American Pastors around the country on a board to meet with to address some of our community concerns?
My appointments to my administration will, hopefully, be based on merit and what people are willing to do for their country. The motivation to serve in my administration must be based on serving the nation and not in fluffing up a resume. I will certainly have a more diverse cabinet than Mrs. Clinton will have. I foresee having several advisory councils to address issues in our society that have not been addressed in the past. Having pastors like you advising me on relevant issues would be a great asset to my administration.
Mr. Trump in 1994 former President Bill Clinton passed the "Crime Bill " which included the "three strikes " provision. Would you consider adjusting the "3 strike rule " which has led to the mass incarceration of African-Americans?
As President, I will ensure that my administration creates a commission to examine criminal justice reform in America today. This includes not only review of the "three strike " provision but also in finding ways to deal with mental health issues that impact adversely our criminal justice system.
Mr. Trump what is your vision for America? And specifically Black America? If you repeal Obamacare what is your plan to provide health care and medicine to those who can't afford it, yet need it the most?
As President, I must serve all Americans without regard to race, ethnicity or any other qualification. I must approach my task with the utmost wisdom and make sure that all Americans have opportunities to achieve to their potential. If we are to Make America Great Again, we must reduce, rather than highlight, issues of race in this country. I want to make race disappear as a factor in government and governance. Every individual, regardless of race or ethnicity, must have access to the full array of opportunities in America. My vision for America is that every citizen and legal resident of this nation will be able to stand side by side and be proud of the fact that they live in the greatest nation on earth. As for the Affordable Care Act, I will work to repeal the act and replace it with market driven solutions that will offer more access to healthcare at more affordable prices. Every American should be able to purchase health insurance across state lines, have health savings account that belong to them, have price transparency so they can shop for the best services at the best prices and know that they will not have to compete with those who are clogging the system simply because they are in this country illegally. We want to block grant Medicaid so that states can provide services closer to the people. We want to make sure that every American has great economic opportunity so that they can seek out their own health insurance and still be able to afford it. This approach will serve all Americans and will ensure that more Americans are covered by better insurance and healthcare options.
Mr. Trump overall across all states in the nation, state and local spending on prisons and jails has increased at triple the rate of funding for public education for preschool through 12th grade. "Reported by Detroit Free Press- Schools vs. Prisons " If elected President what will you do to level the educational playing field in inner city schools? And how will you ensure that there is an increased investment in more schools and education vs. the prison system?
Th is is a difficult question because of its complexity. We must increase educational opportunities by making sure that parents and students have as many choices as possible in finding school options that serve them best. In many of the states where minority students are most disadvantaged, strong teacher unions keep parents from having the choice options they should. States should be encouraged to offer as many options as possible. Whatever the means and mechanisms available, we should provide our parents the chance to get their kids the best possible educational outcomes. As for the prison issue, you are correct. We have had to invest in prisons because we have broken criminal justice system. We do not spend enough time or money on treating the severely mentally ill. Today, our jails and prisons are really holding hospitals for far too many people who suffer from severe mental illness. This is one of the great tragedies in America and it hits the African American community very heavily. We need to work to reform our education system to provide choices and we need to reform our criminal justice system by putting the proper focus on mental health reform.
Mr. Trump many Historically Black Colleges and Universities have been closing down due to lack of funding. How do you plan to keep these schools open and thriving?
Th e numbers have been dwindling and much of this has to do with a downturn in the economy. If we have a more vibrant economy, there will be more ability to support these incredibly important institutions. We must make sure that we keep the incentives for people to invest in higher education through gift-giving and to make sure that the student populations being served have access to grants and other funding that does not cripple their futures but ensures that they have the opportunity to succeed in our society. Working with governing boards, faculty, staffs, students and communities to keep these institutions open is the best solution.
Mr. Trump I am a registered Democrat but I am an undecided voter in this election. It is not only myself but there has been a lot of Pastors and African Americans who have not made up their minds concerning who they are going to cast their vote for. The latest polls indicate that you have 1 percent of the African American vote. What can you say to undecided voters such as myself and others in the African American Community that will win our vote on November 8, 2016? And beyond winning, why is the African American vote important to you?
Al l votes are important to me and my campaign. Your vote, your neighbor's vote, the vote of every American is critical and I must do all I can to make sure you know that if you vote for me, you are voting for a stronger, more vibrant America. My policies offer you a clear choice. You can continue down the road of progressivism that has created a permanent underclass in this country that, unfortunately, includes far too many people of color. If you want a better America, you must break from the historical hold that Democrats have had on people of color and move to options that allow you to achieve your potential. This is all about opportunity -- not sub-standard outcomes and promises of things to come that never materialize. The progressives have worked tirelessly to bring all Americans down to one level rather than allowing as many as possible to rise as high as possible. Education, jobs, religious liberty and protection of civil rights are the promises that I will keep, not just utter to gain favor. If you are interested in a greater America with more opportunity, liberty and prosperity, you must take a chance and walk over to my side. If you want a strong partner in this journey, you will vote for me. I will never let you down. By the way, my support is now up to 8% and climbing.
Donald, can you work with him? Can you work with Pena Nieto --
Oh, absolutely.
To, I don't know. A, build the wall. B, stop the trafficking, the drug trafficking --
Yes.
You know, I suggested on this show last night after your meeting with Pena Nieto that maybe use both Mexican and American labors, they will defray some of the cost of Mexico paying for the wall. Just a thought. You know, talk to me a little bit about the pay for again. Someone written something up today about possibly getting some of the money seized from the drug cartels to pay for that wall.
There are many ways that they can pay for the wall. But you have to understand that we have a massive trade deficit with Mexico. A massive, beyond belief. Not of China category because China is over $500 billion a year. We have real geniuses doing our negotiating, Eric. But we have a massive trade deficit that makes the cost of the wall pale by comparison. So, they will -- I must tell you, I have great respect for the President. I thought we got along very well. And you know, it's just really a very early session. And we have to see. I mean, I think he invited me because he thinks we have a very good chance. And I guess based on the polls that I have been seeing over the last three or four days, we certainly seem to.
Yes. Four hundred million and maybe a billion seven. Let's stay on last night though. Last night after your meeting with Pena Nieto, you delivered a 10 point very, very extensive policy statement on immigration. Some Hispanics were up in arms. Jorge Ramos probably one of the more biased journalist around had a really hard time. He was attacking you but he is also attacking Pena Nieto. What do you say to Jorge Ramos?
Well, I think Jorge is actually a nice guy but I just don't do his show. So, you know, if I did his show, I'm sure he would be very happy. But you know, the fact is that I can't say how it played from the President's standpoint but it certainly played well I think from the stand point of the United States. I think it played very well in terms of people knowing that if I'm president we're going to protect our people.
Uh-hm.
That's what we are doing. We are getting rid of them immediately. Day one, hour one. We will start the process.
OK.
But how it shapes up. And I think we are getting really tremendous reviews on the plan.
All right. We will going to leave it right there. Mr. Trump, thank you so much for joining us tonight.
Thank you, Eric. Thank you very much.
Mr. Trump, Governor Pence, thank you for doing this. We sit here in the great battleground state of Ohio. 63 days to go. How badly do you need to win Ohio to win that White House?
Well we're up in Ohio and you see the kind of crowds we're having in Ohio and I think we're going to win it and certainly I think it will be very important to win Ohio. We're going to do very well in Pennsylvania. We're leading in Florida. We're doing well pretty much all over but winning Ohio. First of all, I worked here for a long period of time and I loved this state and I love the people and I think we're going to win Ohio.
You've heard what people have said. Republicans do not win the White House without Ohio.
Well I've heard that and certainly we intend to win Ohio. We should win Ohio.
Twenty days until the first big debate. Are you ready?
You never know, but I think so.
Are you prepping?
Yeah sure. I'm prepping, maybe not in the traditional way. When I had the debates, I had 11 debates with the -- as you know -- in the primaries, and I was very satisfied. Everybody else was very satisfied with the way I did. And I think I'm working the same way I did there.
But this will be a lot different. I mean there will be two candidates on that stage. It won't be, you know, the list that was there during the primary.
Well we started off with 17 and in the end we had just a few left so, it's not that much different. But I look forward to the debates. I think it's gonna be very revealing.
Any mock debates?
Haven't thought about it much. It could happen. But haven't really given it much thought.
Let me ask you Mr. Trump you just traveled to Mexico and you said shortly after that you and the Mexican president did not discuss who would pay for the wall. And then afterward the president of Mexico said it was discussed and that he said Mexico will not pay for it. Hillary Clinton, who's also here in Ohio, as you know, told us a short time ago that you choked, that the idea of Mexico paying for this wall has been central to your campaign. Did you choke?
So let me just tell you about choking. I don't choke. She chokes. Look at the deals she's made. She's responsible for so many bad things that have happened to our country including the signing by her husband of NAFTA, which has drained our country of its jobs. I've been given A plus, including by you people, but I've been given A pluses for the job I did in Mexico. All that is is a Madison Avenue soundbite. Whether I did phenomenally or not they would have said that. That was a tremendous success for me. You know that virtually everybody including my biggest critics have said that when I went down to Mexico it was a tremendous success. Mike called me and said, 'I've never seen anybody look so presidential.' Many people have said that.
It's true.
And the fact is Mexico will pay for the wall, it was discussed that it wouldn't be discussed but they know my stance and I know their stance. And until I'm president I'm not going to press anything very much, but they fully know my stance. My stance is we're going to build a wall and Mexico's going to pay for the wall. It's very simple.
You know what you have in Donald Trump is not-
Oh, he didn't say that. He tweeted that long after the meeting was over. He didn't say that.
You tweet a lot too though.
I do
When you take a good, strong hard look, does that mean some of those 11 million undocumented immigrants will be allowed to stay?
It could be, but what's going to happen is, if you're going to be a citizen, you're going to leave and you're going to have to come back. We're going to do something -- you know we have thousands and thousands of people waiting on line. It's very, very unfair to put people ahead of the line. We have right now thousands -- they've been waiting ten years, David, to come into the country. It's very unfair to take people and have them circumvent the line. We're going to speed up the line because I want people to come into the country, but they have to do it through a legal process. Tthey have to do it legally
But people want to know the answer to this question. Those who are here who are undocumented who did not break the law, who are coming --
Well they broke the law in coming into the country.
Right.
Is that a correct statement?
So when those families do ultimately go home, the ones who have no record who are here, once you get the wall and the criminals out of here, as you say. Is it self-deportation?
No.
Or will you deport them?
No.
How does it work?
They will -- If they want to become a citizen, they'll go out and they'll come back in through a process, but they have to get on line,
But what is that called? I mean, most people call it --
They don't call it anything
Will they have to go --
They don't call it anything, OK? They don't call it anything. They will get on line, they'll go behind people that have been waiting for four, five years. By that time the line, I'm sure, will be much more efficient because we do things efficiently -- right now it's a bureaucratic mess. It's a total mess. You know a lot of people don't come in legally because of the fact that people are just pouring across the border. That's the way they come into the country, right. So they will get on line and they will come in through an efficient process if they want to become a citizen.
And if they don't want to become a citizen?
They have to make a determination what happens when the border is secure
So you're open to them staying here undocumented?
I'm going to make a decision, or somebody will. Whether it's me or somebody else because, perhaps, depending on the time -- by that time we'll have a secure border, we'll have a wall. We will have stopped the drugs pouring into the country. I mean, you look at states like Ohio you look at states like Pennsylvania or New Hampshire, the biggest thing on their minds is drugs. I say, 'What's your biggest problem?' It's jobs and it's drugs. We're gonna stop the drugs and we're gonna bring jobs back to our states. We're going to bring jobs back to our country.
I do want to ask one more question on something you said a moment ago about people who are undocumented. You are open to the possibility that ultimately they might simply stay?
We're going to make that determination at the time. Once we have a secure border and we stop the drugs and stop the bad ones and get the bad ones out, those are going to be gone immediately. Day one, first hour, I"m going to give a mandate to everybody, including the local police because they know. You know the local police know every one of the bad ones, it's not like, 'Oh gee, let's figure out who it is.' They know every bad gang member, drug kingpin, they know all of them. As soon as I will be in office for one hour and that order will go out. We're getting them the hell out of the country.
And when it comes to Syrian refugees you still --
Over.
Done, right now?
Done. No more. Done. We have no idea who they are, we have no idea are they ISIS-related, we have absolutely no clue. And you see what happens with just one person. You take a look, all over the world, not just here, not just San Bernardino or Orlando, or any of the other places. You take a look at what one person does, the destruction that one person can do. And it is interesting with Hillary Clinton she wants to let the Syrian refugees, or whoever they are, pour into our country. We don't even know where they're putting them. You know the governors of states don't even know who's coming into their own states.
Let me ask you about something you said recently. You said that you have regretted moments along the way to your candidacy where your words have caused personal pain. And I'm curious, who are you talking about?
Anybody.
Can you just give us one example?
No, it's no specifics, just anybody. Look --
Your campaign --
I went through, David, I went through 16 people, we had 17. It was a very harsh, very harsh primary. People say the most in history. The most number of people, but it was the harshest in history. I was rough, they were rough on me, but you know a lot of feelings were hurt, some still, even though they signed a pledge. They haven't been able to endorse me because they haven't gotten over what took place. Number one, they lost, and number two, it was a tough primary.
Do you think the FBI failed on this?
It's not a question of thinking. You know what -- you cover it every night. What she did is a series of lies, gross negligence, carelessness. I mean, your document said carelessness. This is worse, this is gross negligence. They put a young man in prison, or they're going to put him in prison, because he used the wrong Xerox machine on something. What's going on is horrible.
So when the director recommended no criminal charges --
I was shocked. Especially after he read, for a fairly long period of time, just a few of the many things that she did that were illegal.
Tax returns do reveal how much someone has paid in taxes. And how much they've given in charitable giving.
Well that's OK. But I've given a list on things that are given to charity. I have given that list. In fact, I made that list available. I've made a list available.
But you won't reveal what you've paid in taxes unless the audit is done?
When the audit is done, it will happen. I mean, I've gone through audits almost my whole adult life.
And you'll make that case on that debate stage?
Well I think so and you know I'm disappointed that people signed a pledge -- and they signed it so I would sign it, just so you remember. The pledges were signed by everybody so that I would sign it because they didn't want me to be out there as a free agent, so to speak. But I'm disappointed -- and most of them came through, Ben Carson, Mike Huckabee, we have so much -- Chris Christie, I have so much support. People don't talk about the support.
But as you sit here in Ohio, are you upset with Governor Kasich?
I would say I'm disappointed because we are winning Ohio, we're doing great nationally, as you understand. I mean, we're doing very well, I think we're going to win. I don't think the American people are going to allow four more years of Barack Obama and that's what they'll get with Hillary Clinton except I think it'll be even worse.
Thank you, Mr. Trump. Governor Pence. Thank you.
Thank you.
As president -- as the next president what can you do to reform to reform the Veteran's Administration and the health care for our vets? How can we take better care of our vets?
Well, General thank you very much for being here Mike, we really appreciate it. And we really appreciate all of those generals and admirals that today endorsed me. We have...
Almost 90, yep.
The use of the fighters...
That's a promise. That's great.
It should have been done a long time ago.
OK. So one more, here. And I want to talk a little bit about, in this case -- in this case...
It is hard to believe, yes.
All right. So, you are not going to say you are going to beat her easily because have you said that in the past. But you say you are still going to win on track to win. Now, let's look at the CNN poll which has you ahead by one. It's divided along race and gender. For example, you beat Secretary Clinton with men, 54, 32. Why do you think you beat her with men?
Well, maybe they like strong borders. And maybe they like strong military. But I think women do, also. That's why I think I'm going to do very well with women. I notice that we are doing very well with married women.
All right. Stay on the men now. We get to the women in a moment.
I think a lot has to do with the military. A lot has to do with the strength of the borders. And not allowing the Syrians to come in who we just don't know where they are coming from. Who they are. There is no documentation. It's a disaster. Hillary wants them to pour into our country and I don't.
All right. So you think it's a national security play for men to favor you over Mrs. Clinton?
Well, I guess. But I think women want that just as much as men.
Whoa, whoa. Let's get to --
I think women want it as much as men.
Well, I don't know about that. CNN poll has women. Fifty three Clinton, 38 Trump.
Well, you know, if you are asking me the question, I think we went way up with married women and we are going very much higher with women than we were two months ago. I never really understood that why we weren't doing well because it's very much also, it's national security, it's jobs. I think jobs for men and for women. You know, I'm not sure there is such a big difference to be honest with you, Bill.
But there is in the poll. I mean, maybe I don't know why. I think it mostly has to be style over substance, maybe. But there is a huge difference. You dominate on men. Dominate with men. And she dominates with American women. Let's get to the race. In white, white Americans, again, you dominate 55 percent to 34 percent. You are up 21 with whites. Why?
I can't tell you, Bill. I mean, all I'm doing is talking about jobs and bringing back our jobs. I can't say why.
You don't have any opinion on that?
I don't really. I really don't.
All right.
I mean, I had a tremendous experience in Detroit and in Philadelphia this last week. With African-Americans and really inner cities and we went to a church, an African-American church, which was incredible. And, you know, I think, you know, I would think that I'm doing very well with the African-Americans.
Let's go with the nonwhite. Nonwhite is, you know, all non-Caucasians. Clinton 72 percent, Trump 18.
Well, I think maybe 18 is a lot higher than it was three weeks ago. I think we have made a lot of progress. I mean, I actually saw one where it was one percent.
That was just African-Americans. This is in all nonwhites in it. All right. But anyway, look, what I am trying to get at --
I think it's highly under rated, Bill.
OK.
I think it's highly underrated.
This is polarized race. It's polarized along gender. Right now, this could change. I mean, I think the debates will change a lot of things. But it's polarized right now. It's gender, women like her, men like you. Whites like you. Nonwhites like her and, you know, you don't have a theory on why, you know, you don't have a theory.
I don't have a theory, Bill.
OK.
I'm about jobs. I'm about the fence. I'm about borders. I'm about a lot of things. I'm about our vets. I'm about strong military. You know, whether you break it down into men or women or anybody else, I mean, I think people want to hear that and I'm much better at it than she is. She will be very weak on the border. She wants people just to flow in terms of illegal immigration. People are going to flow into the country. And it's going to be a disaster.
Would you cede tonight you don't have a lot of margin for error. You have to take the key states that I mentioned. It's going to be tough for you in Virginia. But you don't need Virginia. It's not a have to have.
Well, I just left Virginia. I know but I just left Virginia and we're just about even in Virginia.
Close. But you know McAuliffe.
I'm not surprised. I think, you know, I see the crowds. I see the people. But we are pretty even in Virginia, too.
All right. Would you cede that you don't have much margin for error in the Electoral College or no?
Well, when you say you again, you are talking about the Republican Party.
You, you, Donald Trump, no, no, no. It's you, Donald Trump.
Well, I'm just saying the Republican Party has a tougher road. There is no question about it. I have known that. It's been that way for a long number of years.
Yes.
But I think we're doing well and I think we are going to win.
All right.
Now, let's get to Detroit. I was going to do this in the second segment. I was going to carry out Mr. Trump over but let's go there now. I thought they were respectful to you when you did have the dialogue with the people in Detroit. But the reaction was, you know, they ran out, they being the media, ran out to find people that smash you which they did. What was your assessment of that whole situation?
I thought the reaction was amazing. And the church was amazing. The bishop was amazing. I thought the whole thing was really an incredible experience for me. And I think it was tremendous success.
What did you learn? What did you learn by going there?
Well, I don't know learn because I knew they were great people to start off with. But, I just reinforced it. These are people of faith. These are people that are strong believers in God. They were absolutely so warm and so genuine and I was very, very impressed.
Did you learn anything about --
Section of Detroit.
All right. Did you learn anything about why Detroit has collapsed? Why have the population has fled the area? Did you learn why?
Do you think -- last question on this. Do you think your birther position has hurt you among African-Americans?
I don't know. I have no idea. I don't even talk about it anymore, Bill.
No, I know.
Because, you know, I just don't find the --
But it's there on the record.
I don't know. I guess was maybe some, I don't know. Why? I really don't know why. But I don't think, very few people, you are the first one that's brought that up in a while. I don't think so. I mean, look, I went to Detroit. We had -- it was like a love fest. We had just a great, great time. I was there for a long time. Again, the bishop and his wife and whole congregation, these are fantastic people.
That you are going to come down hard on sanctuary cities and cut off federal funds.
You're right.
If you are elected, you will do that that criminal aliens, aliens who are here illegally who commit crimes in the U.S.A., you will immediately deport them. You are going to have some static in the court system because of due process but certainly you will authorize authorities to do that.
Right.
Am I accurate so far?
And we will pass Kate's Law.
No, but there's some.
Bill, I think there's very little, OK, but I think there's very little. And the police, the local police know who all of them are. And we're going to get rid of them. So, we are going to stabilize our border. We're going to have a strong border. We are going to have a country again. And then what's going to happen is, when it's all completed, the wall. All of this is completed, the people that haven't committed a crime other than, of course, coming into the country illegally which of course, you know, depending on your definition, those people, Bill are, we are going to determine when we look at where the country is, how the border is, what's happening with our country, which will be down the road, we're going to make a determination at that time as to what to do with the rest.
That's a modification of your original position. But that's fine.
Depending on how you want to view it.
OK. Sure.
I don't know about that. But that's OK. If you want to say that, it's fine.
In my opinion as a news analyst, you have modified your position a bit. But I'm saying to you that I believe the whole package that you put together in Arizona, all right, has now reignited your campaign. That you now have some momentum behind.
Well, and Hillary, just as you know, Bill, it's very important, Hillary has no package. Because she never talks about illegal immigration. She wants everybody to pour into the country.
Right.
She wants the Syrians to pour into the country 600 percent almost. More than Obama has. And he has got thousands and thousands of people pouring in right now.
OK.
She has no -- if you ask her, she has got absolutely zero to talk about on illegal immigration. Everybody can just pour into our country and take our jobs and no matter how they are good bad or indifferent, I mean, just pour into our country, that is a disaster for the United States.
Well, I hope I will get a chance to answer that.
She didn't want to talk about it. And she got brought there -- Bill, she got brought there by Bernie Sanders. You know, super left. I mean, she got brought there by Bernie Sanders.
OK.
But people are going to pour into the country under the Hillary non-existing plan. Nobody even knows what her plan is.
Now, Governor Pence says, he going to release his tax returns. Today Hillary Clinton is whacking you again. You know, she does it almost every day. That you should release your tax returns. If Governor Pence does release his, is that going to put pressure on you to release yours?
Not at all. Nobody cares about it except some of the folks in the media. Nobody cares about it. But just so you understand, I am under audit. A routine audit. And when the audit is complete, I will release my returns. I don't know when this is going to be. But when the audit is complete, I release my returns. I have no problem with it. It doesn't matter.
But the legal people say, do it now.
In the meantime, Bill, in the meantime, well, no but nobody would recommend that. In the meantime, she has 33,000 emails that she deleted. When is she going to release her emails? She probably knows how to find it. Let her release her emails and I will release my tax returns immediately. Now, with this being said --
All right.
I released almost 100 pages of financials to the FEC and they are detailed. There is a lot of information. You get very -- the fact is, you get very little information from the tax return, Bill.
OK. But, when the audit is complete, then you will release it. That's what we learned.
Yes.
OK.
Sure. Thank you.
All right. I appreciate you coming on. As I said, we are still working for Mrs. Clinton to come on, Secretary Clinton. What do you think? Do you think she is going to come up against me?
I have no idea, Bill. Nobody can figure it out. She goes out for a day or two and then she goes away for five days and nobody hears from her. So I have no idea what she is doing.
Would you watch that interview if Mrs. Clinton came on on THE FACTOR? Would you watch it?
I may. I'm not so sure. I might have to turn to another network.
Thank you very much for joining us.
Thank you.
You heard me say to Mrs. Clinton, Secretary Clinton, and it didn't completely work out toward the end there, as much as possible I'd like you to tell our veterans and our people at home why you are prepared for the role of commander-in-chief and try to keep the attacks to a minimum. We've had a year of that and maybe 60 more days of it.
To a minimum, absolutely.
OK, perfect. To a minimum. I guess that's a question of definition.
I guess.
Any time you interview a president, sitting or past president, they will tell you that the most daunting...
Was I supposed to answer this question?
No, no, no, I mean just keep the attacks to a minimum. Any time you talk to a president, they'll tell you the most daunting part of the job is the role of commander-in-chief.
Right.
But when you say...
That was a record, Matt. That was a record in the history of Republican politics. I was able to get more votes than anybody ever has gotten in the history of Republican politics.
Back in August...
And that's how well we're going to have to do, Matt.
So let me read some of the things you've said. "I know more about ISIS than the generals do. Believe me." Was that the truth?
Well, the generals under Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have not been successful. ISIS...
Do you know more about ISIS than they do?
I think under the leadership of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, the generals have been reduced to rubble. They have been reduced to a point where it's embarrassing for our country. You have a force of 30,000 or so people. Nobody really knows. But probably 30,000 people. And I can just see the great -- as an example- General George Patton spinning in his grave as ISIS we can't beat. We had the greatest...
Yeah, you've said if we had MacArthur today or if we had Patton today, we would not have ISIS, that the rise of these military commanders that we have today, they come up the chain of command, and by the time they get to the top, they're too politically correct. And we know that's not a compliment coming from you. Have you lost faith in the military commanders?
I have great faith in the military. I have great faith in certain of the commanders, certainly. But I have no faith in Hillary Clinton or the leadership. You look at what's happened. And, you know, when she comes in and starts saying, oh, I would have done this, I would have -- she's been there for 30 years. I mean, we need change, Matt. We have to have it, and we have to have it fast.
Let me stay on ISIS...
... to fuel themselves.
Let me stay on ISIS. When we've met in the past and we've talked, you say things like I'm going to bomb the expletive out of them very quickly. And when people like me press you for details like that gentleman just said on what your plan is, you very often say, I'm not going to give you the details because I want to be unpredictable.
Absolutely. The word is unpredictable.
But you have your own plan?
I have a plan. But I want to be -- I don't want to -- look. I have a very substantial chance of winning. Make America great again. We're going to make America great again. I have a substantial chance of winning. If I win, I don't want to broadcast to the enemy exactly what my plan is.
But you're going to...
And let me tell you, if I like maybe a combination of my plan and the generals' plan, or the generals' plan, if I like their plan, Matt, I'm not going to call you up and say, "Matt, we have a great plan." This is what Obama does. "We're going to leave Iraq on a certain day."
But you're going to convene a panel of generals, and you've already said you know more about ISIS than those generals do.
Well, they'll probably be different generals, to be honest with you. I mean, I'm looking at the generals, today, you probably saw, I have a piece of paper here, I could show it, 88 generals and admirals endorsed me today.
It's a numbers game. Hillary Clinton claims more numbers.
Well, it's not really -- it's not -- yeah, numbers. People that have been losing for us for a long period of time. I mean, the fact is, we have had the worst and you could even say the dumbest foreign policy. Our results are so bad. We would have been better off had we never, ever spent $2 in that part of the world.
You recently -- you recently received two intelligence briefings.
Yes, I did.
Did anything in that briefing, without going into specifics, shock or alarm you?
Yes. Very much so.
Did you learn new things in that briefing?
First of all, I have great respect for the people that gave us the briefings. We -- they were terrific people. They were experts on Iraq and Iran and different parts of -- and Russia. But, yes, there was one thing that shocked me. And it just seems to me that what they said President Obama and Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, who is another total disaster, did exactly the opposite.
Did you learn anything in that briefing -- again, not going into specifics -- that makes you reconsider some of the things you say you can accomplish, like defeating ISIS quickly?
No, I didn't learn anything from that standpoint. What I did learn is that our leadership, Barack Obama, did not follow what our experts and our truly -- when they call it intelligence, it's there for a reason -- what our experts said to do.
Hallie?
And I was very, very surprised. In almost every instance. And I could tell you. I have pretty good with the body language. I could tell they were not happy. Our leaders did not follow what they were recommending.
Mr. Trump.
Hi, thank you very much.
Thank you. Do you believe that an undocumented person who serves -- who wants to serve in the U.S. armed forces deserves to stay in this country legally?
I think that when you serve in the armed forces, that's a very special situation, and I could see myself working that out, absolutely.
Plans to serve. Plans to serve in the armed forces. As you know, under DACA, we already have people who are undocumented who are serving.
I think military is a very special thing. If they plan on serving, if they get in, I would absolutely hold those people -- now, we have to be very careful. We have to vet very carefully. Everybody would agree with that. But the answer is, it would be a very special circumstance, yes. Thank you.
Let me ask you about some of the things you've said about Vladimir Putin. You said, I will tell you, in terms of leadership, he's getting an A, our president is not doing so well. And when referring to a comment that Putin made about you, I think he called you a brilliant leader, you said it's always a great honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his country and beyond.
Well, he does have an 82 percent approval rating, according to the different pollsters, who, by the way, some of them are based right here. Look, look...
He's also a guy who annexed Crimea, invaded Ukraine, supports Assad in Syria, supports Iran, is trying to undermine our influence in key regions of the world, and according to our intelligence community, probably is the main suspect for the hacking of the DNC computers...
Well, nobody knows that for a fact. But do you want me to start naming some of the things that President Obama does at the same time?
But do you want to be complimented by that former KGB officer?
Well, I think when he calls me brilliant, I'll take the compliment, OK? The fact is, look, it's not going to get him anywhere. I'm a negotiator. We're going to take back our country. You look at what's happening to our country, you look at the depleted military. You look at the fact that we've lost our jobs. We're losing our jobs like we're a bunch of babies. We're going to take back our country, Matt. The fact that he calls me brilliant or whatever he calls me is going to have zero impact.
But the fact that you say you can get along with him, do you think the day...
I think I'd be able to get along with him.
Good evening, Mr. Trump.
Hi.
OK.
I heard it was said that I said that. I would not do that. But I do believe -- I do believe, when you're waiting in line for six, seven days, you should never be in a position like that. You go out, you see the doctor, you get yourself taken care of.
In 2013, on this subject, you tweeted this, quote, "26,000 unreported sexual assaults in the military, only 238 convictions. What did these geniuses expect when they put men and women together?"
Well, it is -- it is -- it is a correct tweet. There are many people that think that that's absolutely correct. And we need to have a...
So many of the issues that we've talked about with you, Mr. Trump, tonight, and Secretary Clinton, are so complex that even career military people and career diplomats and politicians have trouble getting their arms around them.
Right.
You've had a very different background, in business. So nobody would expect you to have taken over the last 20 years really deep dives into some of these issues. But I'm curious about what you're doing now. What kind of research are you doing now? What kind of homework are you doing? What kind of things are you reading as you prepare for the day in two months where you might be elected the next president of the United States?
Sure. Well, in the front row, you have four generals. You have admirals. We have people all throughout the audience that I'm dealing with. Right here is a list that was just printed today of 88 admirals and generals that I meet with and I talk to.
You said in the speech today, you said history shows that when America is not prepared is when the danger is the greatest.
And we're not prepared.
Will you be prepared on day one, if you're elected president of the United States, to tackle these complex national security issues?
One hundred percent. Hey, Matt, again, she made a mistake on Libya. She made a terrible mistake on Libya. And the next thing, I mean, not only did she make the mistake, but then they complicated the mistake by having no management once they bombed you know what out of Gadhafi. I mean, she made a terrible mistake on Libya. And part of it was the management aftereffect. I think that we have great management talents, great management skills.
But you are prepared?
And I have to tell you -- totally prepared. But remember this. I found this subject and these subjects of interest all of my life, Matt. This hasn't been over the last 14 months. I've found these substantiates of tremendous interest. That's why they were asking me about Iraq 14 years ago. They were asking me these questions. They don't ask businesspeople those questions.
Let me end in kind of the same place I started. Have you given much thought, Mr. Trump, if you're elected president and commander-in-chief, to that moment where you're going to have to make that first decision that puts American men and women in harm's way?
I think it's the most difficult decision you can possibly ever make. You're talking about death. And we're talking death to not just our side. We're talking death all over. I would be very, very cautious. I think I'd be a lot slower. She has a happy trigger. You look, she votes for the wars, she goes in Libya...
Have you thought about personally the emotional burden of that moment?
I think it's a tremendous burden. I think there is no greater burden that anybody could have. I've been preparing this for a long time. And, you know, my theme is make America great again. We're going to make America great again. But, Matt, we've also got to make America strong again. And right now, we are not strong. Believe me. We have a depleted military. We have the greatest people in the world in our military. But it is very sadly depleted.
The Republican nominee for president of the United States, Donald Trump.
Thank you, Matt.
Putin recently said that the hacking of the Democratic National Committee emails was a public service. Do you agree?
I don't have any opinion on it. I don't know anything about it. I don't know who hacked. I'm not sure who. I mean, you tell me who hacked? Who did the hacking? But, I have absolutely no opinion on that. I don't know, I haven't heard that statement.
U.S. intelligence and law-enforcement agencies reportedly are investigating whether Russia launched a covert operation to disrupt the 2016 election. What do you make of that?
I don't know. I mean I've been hearing about it, I've been reading about it. I think it's probably unlikely. I think maybe the Democrats are putting that out. Who knows? But I think that it's pretty unlikely. But, who knows? I hope that if they are doing something, I hope that someone's going to be able to find out so they can end it. Because, that would not be appropriate at all.
Joining us on the phone as promised, GOP presidential candidate, Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, thanks for joining us this morning.
Good morning.
I think it was -- it was not the only time, it was last week or in the last couple weeks you made the point that in your view your opponent, Hillary Clinton, didn't have the stamina either mentally or physically to be president, and given yesterday's event, and I am sure you don't take any satisfaction in what we saw yesterday, but would you say that you were probably correct in your assessment?
Well, I don't take satisfaction, Joe, and frankly, you know, I hope she gets well and I hope she gets well soon, but, you know, it was quite sad to be honest with you. I hope she gets well soon. No satisfaction, believe me, whatsoever.
I think I don't know, because I have not kept track of your entire schedule, but it's a grueling process what you are going through and you are on a plane lot now, and --
I am.
You referred to what Mark Weinberger was just saying right before you were on, the global head of Ernst and Young. Part of what he said was he doesn't hear from either candidate he doesn't endorse one candidate or the other but he said the business community is concerned because they are not hearing enough about things about trade or immigration or at least that are not hearing about things they want to hear. How do you reassure some of the global leaders that it's something that you are working on and you will have policies and will reflect what they want to say?
I would love to speak to Mark directly if he would want, but I think I addressed trade and immigration --
Speaking of Mexico, your recent visit there, afterwards the Finance Minister Luis Fidigare resigned and stepped down in what was seen as a huge hit to the President there. And he was a guy educated in the United States and if you talk to American business leaders, he was paving the way for more American investment in Mexico and come cross work back and forth and are you sorry to see him go?
I am. Luis was a great guy and Luis said Mr. Trump was doing very well in the campaign, and we are doing now and we are doing well in the swing states and we are leading in many polls and we are leading in the overall polls and CNN just came out with a number that I am leading by two points overall and we are doing very well and I think we are going to start to do beyond that. We have a tremendous schedule to go, and even today I am going to three different states. You know, Luis saw that, and he wanted to arrange a meeting and I think it was a very positive meeting. I think they lost a tremendous talent the with him and I believe he will be back in Mexico, I really do, and I believe he will be back at a high level. He's a really good guy and a really good talent. I think that -- I think he probably got a lot of publicity and it was good for our country the meeting I had and it was very good for the United States and perhaps it was not perfect for Mexico but Mexico has to understand it's not a one-way street. We have to get something out of the deals also. We are getting nothing.
Shifting gears to, you know, our bread and butter, and that's business issues and the fed. We are so obsessed with the fed you made comments a week or two about artificial markets, the first time maybe three or four months ago when we talked about it as a real estate guy you said I like low interest rates, and I think I don't know whether your position shifted a little because the fed has been at zero for so long and everybody thinks it's not doing that much and are their negative affects and did you come to the conclusion that maybe it can't stay at zero forever and what do you think they should do in september?
It's staying at zero because she's obviously political and doing what Obama wants her to do and I know that's not supposed to be the way it is, because that's why it's low, and as soon as they go low the stock market will go way down, and don't forget, I called brexit and did a lot of calling and what they are doing is, I believe it's a false market. Money is essentially free. I don't invest in the stock market and I think you saw the stocks I bought, and I bought a lot of stock and I am not a stock market guy, and I bought it because I did not use borrowed money when I invested but it's like free money, and the stocks went way up and then I sold them because when I did this, when I decided to do this I figured maybe there's a conflict of interest, who knows, and with them they accuse you with anything so I figured I would sale, and anybody could have made money. But let's see what happens when interest rates go up. I think they are keeping them down and they will keep them down longer and any increase at all will be a very, very small increase, Joe, because, you know, they want to keep the market up so Obama goes out and let the new guy, whoever -- let's call it a new guy, you know, because I like the sound of that much better, but the new person becomes president, let him raise interest rates or her raise interest rates and watch what happens to the stock market when that happens because you have no choice. The people that were hurt the worst are people that saved their money all their lives and thought they would live off their interests and those people are getting just absolutely creamed. The ones that did it right, they saved their money and cut down on their mortgages and did all the things they did everything exactly right, and now they are getting practically zero interest on the money they worked so hard for over 40 years. I mean, those people have really been -- you can almost say discriminated against. The interest rates are kept down by president Obama. I have no doubt that that's the reason they are being kept down.
What makes you think that?
As a real estate person, I love it. But for the last 14 months I have not been exactly active -- I do run my business and spend a lot of time on my business, I have to be honest with you because I am running both a campaign and business, which is not so easy, but I certainly have not done as many deals as I would normally do, but I love low interest rates, but for the country something has to happen. I don't think it's going to happen very much because he wants to go out and he wants to play golf for the rest of his life and he doesn't care what is going to happen after January.
Let's say, Donald, that we do some of this and let's say we cut taxes, and we can't find enough waste in the government to pay for everything, and we do infrastructure and we already have this incredible, you know, deficit run-up to where we are paying interests on that. If rates go up, what are we going to do? It's going to be much more expensive to fund what we have already done?
It's a tremendous problem for the country and we are talking about rates that are practically at zero, if I refinance something I get money for almost nothing. To a certain extent, it's wonderful, I love it and I am getting as much long term stuff I can and I have little debt, but I will tell you this, Joe, at some point if rates ever go up to a more natural level, you know, these are the lowest rates in history, and if rates go up, we have $20 trillion, you know, and we doubled our debt under Obama, doubled it. Exactly, by the time he leaves it will more than have doubled in eight years, and in eight years we doubled what happened over hundreds of years, think of it. We doubled the debt over the last eight-year period, and the worst part about the doubling of the debt, we have not got anything with it, we have not rebuilt bridges or highways or roads or airports and our airports are a disaster and roadways and tunnels are dangerous. The whole thing is a mess. We are $20 trillion and our infrastructure is a disaster, and we spent $6 trillion in the middle east, and we could have rebuilt our country twice, and that's because it was run by politicians that don't have a clue and our country is in trouble. It's one thing if we had $20 trillion as crazy as that number s. But our roads are new and bridges are beautiful, and many of them are in danger of falling down and you see the reports and it's a very, very sad thing what is going on. We have a country that needs massive investment and at the same time we are at $20 trillion.
Mr. Trump, can I go back to the fed for just a moment?
Yes.
Because what you said about Janet Yellen about how she is obviously politically -- and she is doing what Obama wants her to do. I mean, that plays into a stream that we have seen from the left as well. Just last week, senator Elizabeth Warren was working with a group called fed up where they are trying to put constraints on the fed and get their arms around it a little more. I wonder, in a Trump administration, would you be trying to put more constraints on the fed as well?
Well, what I would want to do is have a policy -- I wouldn't go by what Pocahontas wants you to do, because her agenda is obvious. I mean, she's a disaster. She is also one of the least effective senators in the United States Senate. Nobody understands that, but she's done nothing. But I would want to have a policy where we can start to at least gently reduce debt, we can get things under control, because right now, it's not under control. What happens if interest rates go up fairly substantially? And with all of the money we have and we are borrowing, you know what that does to our balance sheet?
Well, obviously. It's huge.
That is a cost that is beyond belief. Everybody is figuring these crazy low interest rates. Well, they are not always going to be this way. And it won't be able to be this way because of market and market competition. And what is going to happen when interest rates go up? And they could go up. Hey, I was there with Jimmy Carter where interest rates -- I think the prime rate went to 21 or 22%. You're probably too young to remember those days, Becky.
no, I remember my parents had a crazy high -- like 18% mortgage rate at one point. It was insane.
Yeah, I mean it was -- but I saw it. 21%. I think the prime rate went to 21%. So, you think that can never happen again. It's like the baseball players. They have a good season and then they go out and they live like they are going to have their season for the rest of their lives and it doesn't work out that way. That's what we are doing. We are living like we are going to have no interest rates, because we are paying almost no interest. That's, you know, the numbers are so low. Now, she's keeping them artificially low to get Obama retired. Watch what is going to happen afterwards. It is a very serious problem. And I think it is very political. I think she is very political and to a certain extent, I think she should be ashamed of herself. Because it is not supposed to be that way.
But this gets to the question of Fed independence. We have this notion that the Federal Reserve operates independently from the administration, from Congress and there are questions on all sides surrounding the fed right now about people who think they are not and finding ways to do that. I guess the question of Fed independence is the biggest one I have.
Well, I used to think that the Justice Department worked independently also. And I used to think that the FBI was independent also. But that's obviously not possible because Hillary Clinton is guilty as hell and everybody knows it. Any third-rate lawyer will tell you that. I mean, it's obvious, it's just -- all you have to do is read it and watch. So I used to think they were independent. I used to hope that the fed was independent. And the fed is obviously not independent. It's obviously not even close to being independent.
I guess you saw the market reaction to brexit was not what any economist expected. In fact, Christine Lagarde, Mr. Trump, said that she's talked to all the best economists in the world and it was going to be an unmitigated disaster if britain voted to leave. And instead, I mean, not only has the stock market done better, but a lot of the economic meterics have improved there because of the weaker pound and everything else. Is that, you think, an indication that maybe -- I mean, globalization is important, but then again so is looking out for number one in this case, whether it's Britain or the United States. Maybe there is something to that.
Well, they call me Mr. Brexit over there, so we will see what happens. I will tell you, I predicted it. I called that. Oyu know, they were -- I took such heat, Joe, you wouldn't believe it. But I said I think it is going to pass because I own turnberry in scotland and I own a lot of other property in the UK. And they asked me two weeks before when it wasn't -- and I said no, I think it is going to pass because the people want independence and they are tired of taking in people from other countries that, you know, potentially want to blow them up. And the people of the UK were very, very smart and it passed. And I thought it would pass. And Obama said if it passes, they are getting to the back of the line, which I actually think helped it pass, if you want to know the truth. But, you know, that is the way it is. They wanted independence. I think it was very smart. I think the UK is going to do better because of it because the whole thing with the, you know, tying it all up like that, it has been a terrible thing. I needed certain approvals on a job, and I couldn't get -- I could get them from the country, but I couldn't get them -- nationally it was impossible to get anything approved. It was horrible. And they wanted -- the UK wanted independence. And they got it. And you know what? I think they are going to be better off for it and it's turning out. Now, it's a very short period of time, but it's turning out to be better so far. And they are very happy about it. I tell you what. If a vote were taken today, it would do even better. They are very happy about it. And I, as an investor over there, big investor over there, having tremendous properties over there, I like it better.
You made some comments about the president's recent trip to asia as well. In terms of it not being as maybe well received as the, you know, head of the, you know, the leader of the free world should be. Any additional comments on that?
Well, when you say "well received," they wouldn't even give him a stair to get out of the plane, Joe. That is called not-so well received. I mean, the guy couldn't get out of the airplane. This is the first time that the great Air Force One, with its incredible history, has landed where they wouldn't give him stairs to get out of his airplane. OK? It was terrible. He had to get out of the -- they call it the mechanic stairs. That's the stairs they use to fix the plane. You know, when somebody has to run up and fix a light bulb, right? So this is our president. And by the way, shortly before, they showed other heads of state from other countries coming down on these magnificent stairways with red carpet. He came down on the mechanics stair. And don't forget, when he landed in Cuba, Castro wasn't there to greet him. When he landed in Saudi Arabia, no high officials were there to greet him. Now the difference between me and him, if I would have landed in Cuba -- first of all, I would have made a much better deal than he made, but that's OK -- and if somebody top wasn't there to greet -- not me, but our nation, because it's really our nation -- I would have told the captain, close up the doors and let's go back to Washington. And the same thing with Saudi Arabia. And frankly, the same thing with China. I have never seen anything like it. They were standing there, they would not provide them with the stair and his people were fighting on the runway with the chinese officials. You saw that. What a sign of total disrespect. It's like the Iranians running their little boats all around our destroyers and making crude gestures at our sailors. It's like that. And you say, how does this happen? Or, like the Iranians, where they captured our ten sailors, Joe, and they wouldn't have ever given them back, unless -- the only problem was the money started pouring in, so they had to give them back because they wanted the $150 billion, which payments started two days after that. So obviously, they gave them back only for that reason. If it weren't for that, they would have kept them -- they would still be there. So there's a great lack of respect. But what I saw in China where they wouldn't provide stairs coming out of air force one -- they wouldn't do it -- was, to me, incredible.
Mr. Trump, you are known as a great negotiator with the art of the deal. You've mentioned yourself that you would negotiate better terms in a lot of these deals. I wonder what you would do about North Korea? Because after this latest nuclear bomb that they've set off, the latest I read this morning was that the North Koreans are saying that this is laughable, the idea of additional sanctions. How would you get a better deal when you are potentially dealing with a mad man?
well, we are dealing with a man who has got some difficulties, there's no question about it. But I will say this, look, China has tremendous power over North Korea. Tremendous power. And also, Iran is one of their biggest trading partners. Now, when we made this horrible Iran deal, one of the most incompetent deals I have seen, they should have put in things like you have to stop fighting in yemen, you have to help us with North Korea because they are one of their biggest trading partners. Iran actually has a certain degree of power over North Korea. But the one who really has power, who can cut them off completely, is China. Now, China doesn't like to say that they have power because they want to tweak the United States. Look what China is doing. They are building in the South China Sea a massive military fortress. Now, we have a lot of power over China because they suck us dry, they take out -- and I like the Chinese. Look, I have the biggest bank in the world as my tenant and all of the different things. I mean, I have great relationships with China. And they know what I say is true. In fact, this tenant just renewed their lease. I couldn't believe it. Actually, I figured they would never -- you know, why would they renew their lease with me, right? But they just renewed their lease. They obviously like the building. But we have tremendous power over China because they take so much -- they suck so much money out of the United States. We should get China to fix that problem. We should use our economic power because without us, China would be in serious trouble. They have -- they take tremendous amounts of dollars out of the United States. Without us, China would be in tremendous problems and we should be able to do that. But we don't have leadership, we don't have the people that can get them to do that and when you ask the chinese, oh, well, we don't want to get involved. OK? They don't want to get involved. Well, in the meantime, this guy is developing the real deal. Two years ago they were saying oh, he couldn't lift off the rocket ships. Well now they are the real deal. And it is getting better and better all the time. And he's, I think, being helped by Iran, ok? I think they are being helped by Iran. But you look at their technology and it's getting better all the time. And something damn well better be done fairly soon, because once he is set, you know, as you say, he may be or may not be a mad man, but he's got evil intentions, there's no question about it.
You know, when you refer to China, they are sucking a lot out of us in terms of the economy. But they also own, I believe, the largest percentage of our debt. So they have a big chit with us as well. Something like $1.25 trillion.
Well, it's all the more power we have over them, ok? We have more power. Because of that, we have more power over them. You do understand that right, Becky?
Right, because of the idea that if you owe the bank $100 they owe you if you owe them?
Yeah. Look, we owe China $2 trillion, OK? $2 trillion. I mean, hard to believe, but that's what it is. Think of it. They suck the blood out of us and we owe them money. That is a hard one to do. They are magicians.
But we wouldn't default on that money, right?
They take our money out and we owe them money on top of it. So, I call them great magicians.
But we wouldn't default on that debt. I mean, that is U.S. sovereign debt.
No, you're not going to default on that debt. But we have a lot of power. We have a lot of power. No, we would not default on the debt. Although, you could make the case, I mean, China has defaulted with us because if you look at what they are doing with intellectual property, $300 billion a year. I mean, you look at what they are doing with the way they steal our intellectual property, our intellectual rights, I mean, it's crazy what they are doing. I mean, they take -- there's like no laws that pertain to them. So you could certainly make a case in a court what they have done to us is incredible. We don't have -- and then they come over and they get steak dinners, ok? We give them steak dinners. Honestly, it's a very sad thing how China has out negotiated us. It's very sad. China could solve the problem we have with North Korea in one day if they wanted to.
So we have a couple of more -- I don't know how much time we have left, but I want to talk about the debates and how you are preparing for those. Whether you like the moderators that are selected. And I would like to see what we have been talking about. Instead of maybe ad hominem stuff, that we are probably going to get, Mr. Trump. But it would be great to have some of the discussion we just had. Real quickly, in The Wall Street Journal. So The Wall Street Journal isn't a -- if you are going to get somewhat objective treatment, I figure you are going to have to look here. But the headline today "are Clinton and Trump healthy enough to serve?" so, at least they address the Clinton issue, but they had to throw you in there, too, as well.
They always do.
Alright. Mr. Trump, we appreciate all the time you have given us this morning. I know you have some other things on your schedule. And we will talk to you again soon, hopefully.
Thank you. Thank you very much, Joe and Becky. Thank you.
What's so interesting is that now the DNC -- if these reports are correct -- might be considering a replacement. Does Donald Trump have a plan to take on Tim Kaine and to take on Joe Biden?
No, I don't think they'll replace her. I -- I think she -- we have to see what's wrong. I mean, we have to see what's wrong. But whatever it is, it is. I'm ready, whatever it is.
So -- so health is an issue now, right?
I think it's an issue. In fact, this week I took -- this last week I took a physical and I'll be releasing when the numbers come in. Hopefully they're going to be good. I think they're are going to be good, I feel great. But when the numbers come in, I'll be releasing very, very specific numbers.
All right...
I am going to be doing -- I've already done it and should be -- the report should be finished this week.
Right.
They don't want people pouring in and taking they're jobs. I really believe -- my base is everything.
Good for weddings.
It's really going to be a great tribute to our country.
And Ivanka led this, correct?
Ivanka led it. Ivanka did a fantastic job. This was her baby.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
And here now with much more is 2016 Republican presidential nominee -- Donald Trump is with us. Sir, how are you?
Very good. Thank you, Sean.
Yes.
And we've spent a lot of time on it. This is complex stuff. We spent a lot of time on it. But it's something where they're going to really be tremendous beneficiaries. And the children are going to be the big beneficiaries, when you get right down to it. But the families and the moms are very happy.
You know, a lot of times, you have explained to me that you want to eliminate Obamacare  and you want choice and you want competition.
Right.
And you like health savings accounts as part of your proposal.
I do.
And you're talking about child care savings accounts. So you're really talking about bringing in the free market here and incentivizing from the tax so it's not going to cost as much in terms of government money. Is that correct??
Well, that's true. And frankly, they can have some money left over when the child reaches a certain age. And you know, they have money left over and they can use that for college. They can use it for what they have to use it for. And it's like -- it's incredible, what this does. And it's going to be great for our government. It's going to be great for families. It's going to be great for, I think, everybody. There's just no down side.
You're right, you got 56 days left. I mean, we're in the end stretch here. How -- let me stay on the health issue for a second. You said you're going to take a complete physical and reveal that. Hillary last night was complaining you didn't reveal your taxes...
I've actually done that.
But it seems that there's a strategy that has emerged by the Clintons. I mean, if 55 percent of the individuals she met as Secretary of State -- when that AP article came out, immediately, the ad came out claiming you were a member of the Klan, etcetera, even saying "Make America great"...
Can you imagine that one.
Yes. Yes. OK. And then even making America great...
Can you imagine that one? Yes.
Bill Clinton is saying...
It's vicious.
Thanks a lot!
Even people that are...
It actually may. I think your...
That might top it.
How do you stay healthy on the campaign trail?
Well, it's a lot of work. You know, when I'm speaking in front of 15,000 and 20,000 people and I'm up there using a lot of motion, I guess, in its own way, it's a -- it's a pretty healthy act and I really enjoy doing it. A lot of times, these rooms are very hot like saunas. And I guess that's a form of exercise, and, you know.
So everyone's talking about the candidates' medical records.
Right.
So I'd like to clear up some questions that folks weren't asking about your health. Is that OK?
OK.
Now, I'm hoping to go with these exact same questions with Secretary Clinton. Now, see, as a doctor, when I have someone in front of me and I don't know much about them, I do something called the review of systems. We all do, we learn this in medical school. And it's a checklist, head to toe, of what's going on in your body.
OK.
I'll walk through these questions, if it's OK. We start with the head. So have you ever had a neck issues?
No.
Neurologic problems? Strokes, headaches?
No.
Any problems with --
Do we have water around here? Here.
Oh, water. Water, OK.
OK. No, the answer is no. We've had -- I've had -- I mean, no, no problem.
Hormone problems, like thyroid issues?
No.
Blood sugar problems? Diabetes?
Nope.
Any heart problems?
No.
I know you're on Lipitor, or some type of statin drug.
Yes. I do take -- I take a statin.
Right.
I don't know if I should mention the name. I would, but --
You don't have to.
I take a statin. And, actually, I've experimented with three statins and one seems for me to work the best. And it's really brought my cholesterol down into a good range.
How long have you been on it?
A couple of years, I would say. A couple of years.
Lung complaints, asthma, wheezing?
No, nothing -- I mean, really nothing. It's been -- people are amazed because I don't get much with the colds. Sometimes in the spring or in the fall, I'll get a little hay fever and that comes and goes. Actually, I don't know why this would be. It used to be worse when I was young. Maybe it's given up on me.
Yes.
But when I was young, it was -- it could be pretty, you know, pretty rough, the hay fever. But very, very little now. And I don't know if that's something that you're not that surprised at, but the hay fever is not very big. But that would be about the only thing. I don't -- I haven't had a cold in a long time, years.
Stomach problems, intestine issues, reflux, diverticulitis?
No.
Bladder or prostate issues? I saw the one letter that was released had a low PSA figure.
Yes, my PSA's been very good. I've been -- I don't know what's going on, but so many of my friends are having problems where they're getting the operation or they're going for radiation. And it's always the first number I ask for. I said give me that number, I want to know. And my number's been, as you said, a very good number. It's been very, very good.
Any history of personal cancer?
No, none so far.
Skin issues?
No, very little. I mean, probably, you could say, you -- I try and stay out of the sun for the most part. I wear a hat. I play golf and I wear a hat, but I've had no problem. No major problem but certainly no problem with skin.
Blood clots or any other blood problems?
No, no.
Let me turn to the family history --
I have to be very boring for you. Really, it's --
No, no. I'm --
It's got to be very boring.
This is what I do as a doctor.
I would tell you -- I would tell you, you know, my wife's a big fan of your show, and I would absolutely say because I view this as, in a way, going to see my doctor. Just a little bit public, that's all.
Good morning. It was good to see you yesterday.
It was. It was.
Right.
And I will tell you, they're more excited about the regulations that this massive tax cut.
And I think yesterday you made the point that Obama put in place, what, 3,300 new rules just in the last 12 months.
He has created a major industry.
Yes.
And he's created an industry for lots of consultants and lots of professionals. And I hate to say this because the lawyers well had to get involved, but lawyers probably are doing very well because of it, because these companies have to hire them to get unentangled from all these -- this web of -- of nonsense that they've put in. So he's created a major industry and it's a very negative industry because it holds back our country and jobs and growth.
Wow.
So it's a disaster.
Yes. And you said yesterday that you're going to name China a currency manipulator if it keeps up.
Well, of course they are.
Yes.
It's currency manipulation. And that's what they do. And that's how they beat us. We make better product than they do. We can't compete. Every time we're about to compete, they devalue their -- their money. So...
But people are worried about you putting tariffs in place. I mean are manufacturers going to do business with America if they see high tariffs? Do you consider yourself a free trader...
Yes, totally.
But don't you want American companies to be able to sell to those 1.3 billion people in China?
Oh, absolutely. Oh...
I mean we're 300 million in this country. Our companies want to sell to the 1.3 billion in China.
Oh, absolutely. Sure, they will.
Yes. Mr. Trump, let me ask you about this birther issue. Your senior communication adviser, Jason Miller, addressed the birther comment saying that you believe President Obama was, in fact, born in the United States. Now, I remember when this all went on and you were very successful in making sure this issue was front and center. He said Hillary Clinton's campaign first raised the issue to smear...
True.
Your communications person said that Hillary Clinton raised the issue first to then smear then candidate Barack Obama in her very nasty failed 2008 campaign for president.
Right.
That you believe that President Obama was born in the United States right now. Can you clarify your stance on this?
Well, I'm going to make a big announcement on it today, probably during my first speech at my new hotel. We -- we're opening, as you know, on Pennsylvania Avenue, the old post office, and it's -- you'll be happy to hear, on budget, exactly on budget, even a little under budget and about a year and a half ahead of schedule. That something you don't hear from government. And it's going to be great.
I remember.
So -- so we will have a big statement and I hope you're going to be watching.
I'm definitely going to be watching. But the bottom line is this, we know that Obama now, he was born in America, correct?
You watch my statement. I -- I have to -- we have to keep the suspense going, OK?
OK.
So you watch. You're my friend. You watch the statement, OK? I think you'll be happy.
Listen, this story really struck us here at the show about Ivanka. She was drilled yesterday by a "Cosmopolitan " writer, OK, asking about your childcare plan. That same reporter spoke with Chelsea Clinton and she ask Chelsea Clinton softful questions earlier this year. Did you speak to Ivanka about what happened yesterday with "Cosmo " magazine and how she handled herself?
I did. "Cosmopolitan " is a dying magazine. It used to be run by Helen Gurley Brown, isn't that correct?
Yes.
That's -- the same one, same magazine?
Absolutely.
Who was a friend of mine, who was a great, great woman. One of the legends in that industry. And since her passing, it's gone downhill. And now it's like a useless magazine, worthless magazine. And I was actually surprised. She did it because she thought the person was a nice person. She knew it. She did them a favor, because who wants to read it in -- nobody reads "Cosmopolitan " magazine anymore. So she did it to be nice and I heard the person -- I haven't seen it, but I heard the person was really rude to Ivanka. And everybody loves Ivanka. Ivanka's a good person. You -- you know that.
Yes, she...
And everybody loves her. And she did it out of her heart because she feels so strongly about child care and -- and she was like attacked by this, you know, rather non-intelligent reporter, but really attacked viciously. And I said, don't let it bother you. You know, I said, welcome to the world of Trump.
Yes. Well, you know what, she handled herself beautifully.
No, she did, but it's very unfair. And this is a magazine that's a dead magazine. I said, what are you wasting your time, you shouldn't even do it.
It's really one of the bigger expenses. You're absolutely right.
It could be their biggest expense. I mean it's bigger than their mortgage -- mortgage costs.
Yes.
It's bigger than their housing cost. It's just incredible. So I'm very proud of it.
And when you unveiled it -- when you unveiled it, you had all those women around you. We had Marsha Blackburn on the show earlier this week. Do you think it's resonated with women? This is a group you've got to get the votes in order to win the election. What do you think this plan has done with regard to the impact on women.
Well, I think it is resonating with women. Women are -- I mean we have been called by so many people and, you know, Hillary Clinton was all talk, no action. All of a sudden she wants to come up with this plan and her plan is not a good plan. But she was caught off -- off sides. But, you know, again, she wasn't available for the last three days.
Right.
But -- but she was caught off -- you know, she was caught by surprise. I will say, this is something that's been very close to my heart, but it's been so close to Ivanka's heart. And Ivanka was pushing for this before I even said I'd run. I said, if I run, she goes, dad, if you run, you have to do something for women with child care. Do you understand that? I say, OK, I promise, you know? So this is something that is very close to Ivanka's heart.
And -- and she's got credibility on it. She's got kids herself.
Absolutely.
Let me -- let me switch gears. You're a New Yorker. I'm a New Yorker. There's a report, Mr. Trump, that New Yorkers are leaving New York in droves for other states because of high taxes. In 2014 alone, more than 126,000 New Yorkers fled the state. How do you plan to make living here affordable for New Yorkers and can you take New York?
Maria, if I left New York and moved to another state, like Florida, I would save tens of billions of dollars. And the reason I don't do it is one simple reason, I'm loyal to my state. But they've got to do something with taxes because not everybody is like me. They've got to do something with taxes. The taxes in New York are killing the people that are here. And people are leaving. And they're the wealthy people. They're leaving and they're saving millions and millions of dollars a year. New York has got to get going. They've got to do something with taxes.
Well, have you spoken to de Blasio about this, Mayor de Blasio?
No. No. I -- I just -- that -- I was with Andrew Cuomo the other day, who I like. And, look, he knows the problem. We have to do -- you have to do something with taxes in New York. I was with him at the -- at the very famous -- that very famous morning where Hillary had her difficulty and we -- we stood together for a long period of time, we talked, and, you know, I told him and he understands. It's not like he doesn't understand it. Unless they cut taxes very substantially, you're going to lose a lot of people from New York.
I mean...
And -- and I think -- I think this. Look, I think that this plan is a great plan. We're in trouble. Explain to Mark we have $20 trillion in debt. We have high taxes in this country, very high taxes. Our companies, much like New York, but on a much larger scale, our companies are leaving. They're leaving this country. They're moving to other countries. They're leaving for lots of reasons, but they're leaving because taxes are too high, regulations are too high and they're leaving because they can't get money back that is their money. They can't get money back into our country, both bureaucratically and from a tax standpoint. And people have to understand that.
And most people, business people, understand that. A 15 percent corporate tax would -- would be huge. But what about the entitlements? I mean are you going to do anything about Social Security, Medicare? Isn't that where much of the cost is?
Well, you know, we have a contract with people on Social Security and they're violating -- so many people want to violate that contract. I don't. But what we are going to do is waste, fraud and abuse, which is massive. And we're going to bring it so that it's properly run. But we are not going to do that. We have a contract and we're not going to do that.
Right. That's true.
You're really preparing all your life. And I've seen people, and you know the people I'm talking about because you've seen it to, and I've seen people prepare and block themselves in a house and talk to nobody and take no calls and do nothing for weeks but prepare for a debate and they get on the stage and they freeze and they choke and they are horrible. And I've seen it that way very often, actually, where they're -- they have so much knowledge crammed into their head that they can't speak. And, you know...
Yes. And we just did that...
I really think I'm very good on foreign policy, but I think I'm given no credit for it.
Do you have anybody playing Hillary?
No, I don't.
So she's preparing for the debate. Who do you think should -- should play you at these practice sessions?
Well, I don't know. I just hope it's a very good-looking person.
All right, let's get to these Fox polls, Mr. Trump, because this really is showing a tightening race. We've got a newly released Fox News poll that shows you are gaining momentum. To what do you attribute you gaining this momentum these last couple of weeks? You look at the two-way presidential race, you poll ahead at 46 percentage points versus Hillary Clinton's 45 percent among likely voters.
Good.
When you factor in third party candidates, Clinton gets 41 percent, you get 40 percent, the Libertarian, Gary Johnson, is at 8 percent, and Green Party's Jill Stein is three percentage points. How do you plan to pull comfortably ahead, Mr. Trump?
Well, I think doing more of the same. You saw me yesterday. I was honored to have you there. We had a great room of people and I got a lot of credit for getting up with a teleprompter that was defunct.
I saw that.
And -- and so I had to little wing it at the beginning and ultimately it went on, but I think I handled it well. I got a lot of credit for handling it. You know, you're standing in front of a group of your friends and -- and many killers, right, killers that you interview all the time, killers in the sense of -- of business and things. And -- and you're standing there and you have a teleprompter that was put in by people that didn't know what the hell they were doing, to be honest with you, but -- but I -- you know, I think the speech really went well. it was very well received. A great audience. A terrific audience. And, you know, it's -- look, its tax cuts and it's -- it's things that they want to hear and it's things that they want to do to spend money and do -- bring new businesses into the country. And, frankly, to keep old businesses going, because right now in the regulations and taxes are so horrible that old businesses, businesses that have been started a long time ago are starting to fold up.
Yes. By the way, I think you did a very good job in Detroit with the pastor. I was watching you live and I thought to myself, wow, you know, you started to go into your speech and she stopped you. You handled that very well.
Well, she put out a FaceBook post prior to me doing it, which you probably saw. So, you know, look, I don't -- I don't even get into it, the whole thing, but that worked out well.
Yes.
And, you know, Flint is such a horrible situation what's happened there. It's a very sad -- Flint is a very -- a very, very sad situation.
And the EPA never took responsibility. It was a great quote that you made when you said, look, you used to drink the water in Flint.
Yes. Right.
And make cars in Mexico. It's the opposite right now.
Right. Exactly the opposite.
Incredible.
Flint used to have the good water, Mexico the bad water, right? Now -- and they you -- they did the cars in the opposite way. It's sort of funny. People do get a kick out of that.
You let him mess up your hair. Wow!
I did. He said, Donald, do you mind, during the break, he said, could I just grab your hair and mess it up? And I said, you know, Jimmy, if you have to. I said, I'm going to New Hampshire. I really would appreciate if you didn't do too big a number. You know, I use the hair spray stuff, right? So I said, I really would appreciate if you didn't do -- well, I'll tell you one thing, one thing you'll say, my hair is my hair. And, look, at least there's no more talk. But -- but it is mine. But he did a nice -- he did a little bit more of a number that I thought, but it was fun. We had a good time.
Yes, people are talking about it. And, you know what, I think you're getting credit for it because they're saying, look...
Good.
He -- he put himself out there.
Good. Got it.
And you did. And then there was Dr. Oz. So when you look in the mirror, you look -- you think of -- that you're 35 years old?
I feel the same. I don't think I'm 35, but I -- I feel the same in terms of my health as if I'm 35. I mean, look, you saw me yesterday. I went from there to New Hampshire to two other speeches that you didn't see, to an early meeting with a lot of people and I got home last night after New Hampshire at about 12:00 in the evening. And I talk to you now and I'm going to the hotel. You know, my schedule -- my schedule is a much more vigorous schedule than Hillary's schedule. You understand that.
Yes.
Hillary is off so many days. That's why they were saying, oh, well, their schedules are tough. Well, my schedule is a much different schedule. And that's why I can spend much less money on advertising, to be honest with you. I mean I'll lay it on the table. I can spend much less money on advertising and actually be up in most of the polls because you said, you know, we're gaining. But if you look at Ohio, I'm leading. I'm leading in Florida. We're leading in North Carolina. We're leading in -- we're just about leading in New Hampshire. We're -- you know, we had polls come out in Colorado where we're leading Colorado. That's not someplace where Republicans lead. But I felt from the day -- I know Colorado. I love Colorado. I've always felt that I'd win Colorado. And, you know, we're doing very well. And yet I've spent a tiny fraction of the money that she's spent.
Wow. And...
I'm tired.
And that's why Pennsylvania was so important as well.
Well, Pennsylvania, I'm three points down in Pennsylvania and I'm just starting my Pennsylvania push. I love Pennsylvania. I went to school in Pennsylvania and my kids went to school in Pennsylvania. I'm just starting now my Pennsylvania push. So, you know, I think we're doing really well and -- and I am, I'm spending a fraction. And we've raised a lot of money, by the way, but I'm spending a fraction of the money that she's spending.
Is it more important to spend that money on negative ads, talk about, you know, conflicts at the Clinton Foundation, is it more important to spend money on that or more important to spend money on ads that basically have you talking about your policy?
I'd rather do policy. I think it's more effective. People know she's a very ineffective person. People know she has been a disaster as a senator. Remember when she was running -- you would remember this -- when she was running for New York state -- you know, when -- when she was up in New York state and she was running for U.S. Senate and she said she was going to bring the jobs back to New York and everything's going to be peachy, rosy, beautiful. She was a disaster. The jobs fled. It was a total lie. It was a total misrepresentation. She went upstate New York. She got their vote. And she said she was going to work -- she -- I don't even think she went back there. She -- you have to see that place. Upstate New York, where I have out -- I think I'll get -- I mean I think I'll get 80 percent of the vote, maybe more. But you look at places on Long Island where the businesses have left, they've gone to Mexico and other places. She campaigned on bringing jobs back. Not only didn't she bring jobs back, they lost a lot of jobs. And she was a disaster. So she's now doing the same thing with the country and people are aware of it.
Well, when you talk about one issue, the Dems have a very good way, a good strategy of changing the conversation.
Oh, yes.
When I was at the Democratic National Committee, I mean Debbie Wasserman Schultz got pushed out because of her emails when we all learned that she was in the tank for Hillary and they were trying all sorts of ways to get Bernie Sanders out and immediately they changed the conversation to Russia and everybody fell for it. And now everybody sees you as having a relationship with Russia.
Yes, no, they tried to change -- like he -- like Putin's my best friend and, oh...
Right.
And now they feel emboldened and they're taking advantage of us.
Yes.
So, you know, that's the way we have it. It's pretty sad to see. But she would be a disaster. It would be four more years of Obama.
Mr. Trump, thanks very much for your time this morning. We appreciate you joining us.
Thanks a lot, Maria. Take care of yourself.
Donald Trump, welcome.
Thank you, Howie.
Hillary Clinton called half of your supporters a basket of deplorable, racist, sexist, xenophobic. When Mike Pence was making the rounds of the media with Wolf Blitzer and others, he was asked to call David Duke who is supporting you a deplorable and when Pence criticized Duke but didn't use the word deplorable, he got a bunch of negative headlines. What do you make of that?
Well, it's just the media. The media is trying to do whatever they can to stop what's happening. And, you know, either way Mike could have won -- he was very rough on David Duke, but he didn't want to fall into her word. I mean he didn't want to use her word and you understood that, because no matter what he said, he would have been criticized.
Right.
And I was impressed with Mike and I have been very, very impressed with Mike. He was very, very tough on David Duke, I can tell you that.
Colin Powell in those hacked emails was very critical of you and Hillary Clinton calling you a national disgrace among other things, your response to the former Secretary of State?
Well, I've not been a fan of his. I thought when he was talking about weapons of mass destruction, he really lead us down a very horrible path that, obviously, the administration picked up and they went into a war that they shouldn't have gone into, but I was never a fan of his, and we can do a lot better. So, you know, I guess he knows my feelings about him, and...
Yes.
... you know, might as well say whatever he wants to say, but he's known my feelings about him.
And at the same time, you've now lifted the restrictions, you'd yanked the credentials of a bunch of news organizations "Washington Post, " "Politico, " "Huffington Post, " "The Des Moines Register, " "BuzzFeed " and others why did you change your mind on that?
Just because they can't treat me anywhere so I might as well let them be there.
OK. Now, on the -- let's turn to the debates. You said you would prefer no moderators, "the system is being rigged, so it will be a very unfair debate". How is the debate system rigged?
Well, it is a rigged system. The whole thing is, if you look at what's going on. Look, Matt Lauer did a fine job. Matt Lauer was very tough on me and, I guess, he was tough on her. I thought frankly he was tougher on me. I won that evening, the forum, the NBC forum and according to every poll and everybody just about, I won that evening with Hillary and declare that...
Right, but...
... let's not even have a host. Let's -- let Hillary hit all the linking Donald's debates that didn't have -- that didn't have the host so let's see with the moderator...
But do you think -- well, Donald do you -- do you think that Lester Holt or Martha Raddatz or Anderson Cooper or Chris Wallace is going to be pressured into not being fair to you?
Sure, I think. I think that's what's happening right now. By the way, they are hitting Matt Lauer because Matt Lauer they felt wasn't as tough on me, and he was actually just as tough, if not tougher. But by doing that, they are gaming the system, that's what they are doing and why that's they are doing it and they are doing it for the debates. So, no I think that and I think you think that too, Howie. I think, you know, you've made yourself clear.
Well, I think Lauer did a -- basically a good job and he has been on fairly...
I think he did a very good job...
Yes, well...
... but he was tough on me, but I thought he did a very professional job.
Let me move on. You said in many interviews, including with me, that you opposed the Iraq war before it began. Now, I've looked at the forums that you've cited Esquire Magazine, Neil Cavuto Show and don't see any clear evidence of that. And of course, you had the sort of a lukewarm comment to Howard Stern and I guess so to be...
Well, that was long before the war started and I can tell you that was long before the war started with Howard that's the first time the word Iraq was ever mentioned to me...
But why not say...
... and that was a long time ago and...
Why not say you're a private business...
... it was very lukewarm -- wait a minute, it was very lukewarm...
Right, but why not say I was a private -- I was a private businessman. I had no responsibility to take a public position before the war and I criticized the invasion after it began?
Well, I fought with Sean Hannity over it and the Neil Cavuto statement is pretty close to being like don't go in and don't make the mistake of going in. I said, I think, the economy is, you know, has to come first. And also if you look shortly thereafter, one of the major people on television actually say, you know, whether Trump was for it or not before before the war, the fact is he was totally against it in the "Esquire " interview which took place pretty quickly after the war started and that's the same thing. But to me it's not even the same thing. I was against it before the war started...
All right.
... and I hear more about this. But Sean Hannity will tell you...
Why do you keep on looking into it?
... because I used to argue with him all the time.
But let me finish on this question of the polls because by every -- by most accounts you are running a more disciplined campaign, you are giving scripted speeches, and that's a contrast to August when you were creating a lot of controversies. I know you say the press were making too much of those controversies, but sometimes you'd make off the cuff remarks that would resonate around the media anchor chamber for days. So, do you think that you've adjusted and that you think that the previous style was a mistake when you were down in the polls now that you're coming back to just about even?
Well, I think I have somewhat adjusted. I think that that honestly what I said I mean thought I did very well before. You know, like when they said he did a bad three weeks, I'd say, you know, tell me what I did wrong and people couldn't even say. But they take something that I said and they take it out of context, and then shorten the sentence or they'll do something else to chop it up into pieces and it wouldn't sound like what I said. So...
... so clearly the race is tightening. I wanted to get a sense of how you have adjusted. And Donald Trump thanks very much for calling into the show.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
So I have your statement on the terror over the weekend. He is going to read one sentence, quote, "I will bring an end to the senseless acts of violence wrong to say that we are in a fight about narratives. These terrorists pose an existential threat to our country our values and our way of life." I don't know if anybody can bring an end to individual acts of violence. You know, I mean, I don't think it's possible. Am I wrong?
Well, one thing you have to do is degrade. What's happening is they are going around. They feel emboldened and they feel wonderful. And all of these young people in our country and other countries are looking up to ISIS. Because ISIS continues to taunt the United States. They started off on a small area. They are now in 28 countries. Bill. Twenty eight countries. Think of it. This is during Hillary Clinton's tenure. Twenty eight countries and it was just reported. And I would tell you, that is disgraceful. So, you have to bring them down and you have to bring them down fast. You know that the young people in our country and other countries. They are looking up to these people. They have respect for these people. It's like -- let's put it this way, they are getting good public relations because it looks like they are beating the United States or certainly like the United States can't beat them.
Right. And it certainly is a psychological war as well as the physical war. But Western Europe hasn't really helped out and I mean that's going to be a part of the equation for the next president because Mr. Obama really doesn't. Mr. Obama said today, I don't know whether you are aware, that his strategy is fine. You know, just wear them down, wear them down. We don't need really any, any more action. What he is doing. It's the -- we defined here, the strategy of acceptable losses. Now, another thing you said that was very controversial is that you want to profile. You want to profile Arab or Muslim men. How would that work?
Well, we have no choice. Look, Israel does it. And Israel does it very successfully.
So, what would you do though?
If you want to be so politically correct --
Do you have a vision of how that profiling would work?
It works. And we see somebody that we think there could be a problem. At airports and other places. You talked to them and you see what's going on.
But I think they do that now.
We don't do that.
You know, look, the alleged bomber here in New York lived over a chicken stand his father owns in New Jersey. I mean, come on. And the guy out in Minneapolis, who are in that area, Saint Cloud, he is a 20-year-old college student. So he needs to just people who are loons. They just lose it and I don't know if we could ever stop that.
The guy over the chicken stand brought litigation a lot of litigation against different people. And I bet you that's why he was on the list. You know, he was on the list. His father didn't want to put them because they don't want to get sued. So, they probably saw he is a litigious guy, and they don't want to get sued so they left him alone. Who knows what the reason is but whatever the reason is, it's no good. We have to end this. It's horrible. And one thing I will say. I mean, I think they have gained great respect for ISIS and the leaders of ISIS and you see it all the time. And they are becoming, they are being radicalized. And Bill, it's going to get worse with this administration certainly with the way it's gone and with Hillary Clinton. So I get a kick where Hillary Clinton says, I will this, and I will that. What's she been doing for the last 30 years? Remember when she voted for the war. What's she been doing for the last 30 years? Number one, she voted for the war. What she been doing for the last 30 years.
But I want a little more definition. When you say my strongest suit is my temperament, what does that mean to you?
Well, I know how to win. I know how to win. I have been winning. I do win. Even in sports. I win. And we don't win. Our country doesn't win. We don't win at trade. We don't win. We can't beat ISIS. Can you imagine General Douglas MacArthur or General Patton? Can imagine they are spinning in their grave right now when they see the way we fight. We announce that we are sending certain people over here at a certain time. Everything is political. It's very, very sad. Then we bomb the Syrian troops. You saw that over the weekend. We bombed, I guess we killed more than 80 troops. And now Russia is absolutely furious at us. But we bomb the wrong people. I mean, we are like the gang that couldn't shoot straight. Our country, with this leader, is the gang that couldn't shoot straight. That's what it is.
All right. That's an old Jimmy Breslin book. Final question in this segment and then I want to talk to you about the debates. When you say that you're going it profile certain Muslims, are you ever worried that the peaceful Muslims, and there are millions of American -- you know, we don't have a big problem here with Muslims like they do in Europe and France. We don't have that big problem where they are ghetto wise and they don't like their country and police can't go into the neighborhoods. You know the problem in Europe. We don't have that. Are you worried that sometimes when you say these things like peaceful Muslims will be the victim of backlash, the victim of people just lumping everybody into the terror jar?
Well, first of all, I never said that they were Muslims. You did. You told me Muslims. I didn't say that. I am saying, you go into profile, people that maybe look suspicious. I didn't say they were Muslims.
But how do they look suspicious? I mean, how?
I don't know. These are experts. That's what they do. They profile. You go to Israel and they should study it because Israel has done a phenomenal job about this. And they profile. And they are not happy about it but they do it. And people aren't complaining about it but we have to profile.
But it's almost 100 percent of the terrorism now is Muslim fanatics, almost 100 percent. You are not going to be profiling leather jackets who, you know, with blue eyes at this point.
Honestly whatever it is. But I'm not using the term Muslim, I am saying, you're going to have to profile.
All right.
We will going to have to start profiling. And it's, you know, I don't know if it's that bad. But certainly it's not a wonderful thing. But, we have a country to keep safe. And we're not going to keep our country safe. You see this happening. And you know and I know it's going to get worse.
All right. We're going to hold Mr. Trump over against his will.
Unless I'm president.
All right. One week from tonight, you will be on stage Hofstra University, Long Island, New York. Five miles from my house. And it's going to be probably the most watched debate in the history of this country. Because people want to see if you, Donald Trump, are going to take Hillary Clinton apart in a very personal way. Are you?
I have absolutely no idea. I think this, if she treats me with respect, I will treat her with respect. It really depends. People ask me that question, oh you are going to go out there and do this and that I really don't know that. You're going to have to feel it out when you are out there. But she has got to treat me with respect. I am going to treat her with respect. And I would like it start off by saying that because that would be my intention.
OK. Now, if she baits you into trying to say something inappropriate or explosive or controversial, are you aware that that might happen?
Hey, I went to the best school. I was the best -- I was a very good student. I mean, you know, Bill, what kind of a question is that? If she baits me.
Well, I mean, look, yes.
She can bait me and I can bait her and we will see what happens.
Well, I mean, look, her strategy is in the debate.
Debate her and we'll see what happens.
So, say she said --
Strategist.
I'm Hillary Clinton, OK? And I say you know Mr. Trump, you're not qualified to be president. You have never held any office and you call women bad names and Muslims bad names and Mexicans bad names. And you are just not qualified. And I mean, I don't want your answer now. But, that could absolutely happen.
Sure. And I can talk about her deleting emails after she gets a subpoena from Congress. Lots of other things. I mean, I can talk about her record, which is a disaster. I can talk about all she has done to help ISIS to become the terror that they have become. And I will be doing that. So, I mean, we're going to go back and forth. And then she has got a lot of baggage. I'll tell you what. She has been there a long time. And we need change in this country. I mean, she has been there, Bill. A long time. When I hear her talking about what she is planning to do, why hasn't she done it for the last 30 years?
I remember that.
They quoted women and they never even said it and it was on the front page centerfold massive big color picture. It was disgraceful. They are so dishonest. I will tell you what. There is nobody that respects women more than Donald Trump. That I can tell you. And I will help women, because we have the women's health problems. We have a lot of problems.
All right.
And I will help a lot more than Hillary can. That, I can tell you.
Now, you skillfully dodged that question. That was a really a good dodge. Would you go into the marital arena if she hits you with the women thing?
I don't think I'm looking to do that Bill. I don't know what I'm going to do exactly. You know, it depends on what level she hits you with. If it's fair if it's unfair.
Right.
But certainly I'm not looking to do that.
OK. All right. Lester Holt, you know him, he is a debate moderator. You know Lester?
I do. I do. And I have respect for Lester.
Good. Because I worked with him at Channel 2. I don't know if you remember back then but Lester and I worked together there in New York. And I think he is a fair guy. I think he is an honest man. I don't think he is coming in with any ax at all.
Well, I mean the only problem is Matt Lauer is a pro. And he did a great job. We had a debate of source. They called it a forum. And that was on Monday night. And I think Matt did a fantastic job last -- this last week. I'm sure you read about it. And they came down -- Matt was very tough at me and he was tough on her. But I thought he was equally tough. Maybe even tougher on me. And they really hit him because I won that debate. Everybody said I won. The polls all said I won. And I won the debate. And they hit Matt because they say he should have been much tougher. Well, he couldn't have been much tougher.
Yes.
And what they're doing is they are gaming the system, like gaming the ref. They are also going after Lester.
Yes. They are trying to intimidate Lester.
Absolutely.
But I think the world is going to be watching that. He is not going to be intimidated. But he is not like me obnoxious and he is not going to, you know, come back and debate you like I kind of debate you and Secretary Clinton. He won't do that.
I would say that, nobody is obnoxious like you. I would have to agree with that no, no.
I think that we can all agree.
Lester --
I think that's a bipartisan absolutely. But Lester is not going to do that. But I want to get to --
No, Lester is a professional. We will see what happens. I mean, I think it's unfair.
All right. Now.
I think it's unfair what they're doing, Bill.
You have two kind of partisan people though. The next debate, you have Martha Raddatz at ABC who I worked with in Boston. Brilliant journalist. But she is a Democrat. And then Anderson Cooper, I think he does a decent job over there but he is a Democrat. OK? So, you have two Democrats. And are you showing up for that or what are you going to do?
And by the way, Lester is a Democrat.
I didn't know that.
Look, it's a phony system. Lester is a Democrat. I mean, they are all Democrats. OK? It's a very unfair system. Look, I've worked pretty well within the system. I guess by a lot of polls, I'm leading many of the polls. And most of the polls. CNN just came out with a poll, I'm leading nationwide now by two. I'm leading a lot of the states. I'm leading Florida where I am now by three or four. Something just came out. A poll just came out. I'm leading it by three points or four points. And, you know, I think I'm doing well. Leading Ohio. Leading in North Carolina. I think we are doing very well.
That will change and then you will see.
And the systems --
But Raddatz and Cooper. Are you OK with them or no?
No, not really. I'm not OK with Anderson Cooper because I think he treats me very unfairly at CNN. I think he is very unfair on CNN. I think CNN, they call it the Clinton News Network, that's why the ratings aren't doing very well.
Well, they have to compete with MSNBC. That's why they may be doing that. But you say you are unhappy with it, you are not going to boycott it like you did the FOX thing.
No, I will show up. I'll show up.
All right.
Gaming the ref. That's what they are doing.
Right. The last one is Chris Wallace. He is fair, right?
He is fair. He is tough. He is fair. I don't mind. As long as he is fair. And I have done a lot of work with Chris. And I have never had a problem with him.
All right. Good. OK. Well, we always appreciate your time. And again, Hillary Clinton has been invited and invited and invited on this program and she says she is going to come did. You know that? Her people told us she is going to do the interview with us. So, we are hoping that they keep their word. And we'll talk to you, I hope, after the debate. Good luck, you know, that's going to be quite something. Don't get nervous though. Are you nervous? Are you going to get nervous?
Well, I don't think so. I'll be a little bit. I mean, you have to be a little bit. But I understand the ratings will be comparable to yours. So I do your show. What's the big deal?
You can get by that all right. Donald Trump, everybody. There he is.
Thank you.
Donald Trump thinks it's time for a change, a big change.
African-American communities have suffered under Democratic control!
African-Americans are getting crushed by the Obama economy.
Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty. Fifty-eight percent of African-American youth are not working.
Black Lives Matter!
Vote for Donald Trump. I will fix it.
Well it's great to see you. How are you?
Very good, thank you.
You heard all of those statistics. You cite a lot of them in your speeches.
Right. I do.
Really bad.
Bad. Very bad. For the African-American community, very bad, and honestly, for the community of this country. I mean, we're not doing well. You know that. Our good jobs have been taken away. They've gone to Mexico, they've gone to all over the place, but they haven't come back to us, so we're going to make some very big changes.
But disproportionately, black Americans have suffered the most.
Totally, absolutely, not even close. That's why I say, you know, like, I can fix it. We're going to fix it. And I always say, What do you have to lose? Some people like that, and some people don't, but it's like -- and people are using that statement all over the place now. What do you have to lose? It's so bad. Some of the inner cities are so bad that it's -- look, it's a disgrace, frankly, what's happened.
I bet there's -- I bet nobody knows the names of any of those 3,660!
Yes.
Right.
Hands up. He was doing everything he was supposed to do, Sean.
I saw it. He had his hands up.
I don't know if she choked. He was walking, his hands were high, he was walking to the car, he put the hands on the car -- now, maybe she choked. Something really bad happened! But this is something -- you know, it's...
How do we stop this cycle of violence? And more particularly, I mentioned Chicago, 75 percent of those shootings are black Americans, 3,660 since Obama's president.
Yes.
... down to 500.
Yes. So it went -- it was unbelievable. And it was stop and frisk. Now they've stopped it in New York. Let's see what happens. But Chicago, maybe more than ever, you're going to need something because what's going on there is absolutely out of control.
Yes.
We build schools in these places, and they knock them down, we build them again, they knock them down, we do it a third time -- look, it is insane. We've spent 6 -- we're up to $6 trillion in the Middle East, and our roads have potholes, our highways are in bad shape, our bridges are falling down. So it's -- people are tired of it.
When she uses all of those names -- now, she has taken money from countries like the UAE and Kuwait and Oman and Saudi Arabia. So she says, you're racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, but she takes money from a country that tells -- where men tell women how to dress, women can't drive, women are told whether they can go to school or work. Gays and lesbians are killed for being gay and lesbian, and by the way, they persecute Christians and they persecute Jews. Is that hypocrisy?
Well, look, everybody understands what's going on there, and it's a whole pay for play deal. And a lot of people have been saying it, and for some reason, nobody is picking it up. They're just not picking it up. They don't want to pick it up. They don't like seeing what's happening in the polls. They don't like where we're leading in Florida. We're leading in Ohio.
Thank you. How you doing, Mr. Trump?
How are you?
That's correct.
And when he called me -- and this wasn't just recently, a long time ago, he endorsed me for president. And I shouldn't tell them this. I think he endorsed Bernie Sanders for vice president, so...
But number one, number two, you know...
He was very happy with Mike Pence. I have to -- where is Mike?
You don't ever tell this story. I -- look, I've known u for decades now. And I've been to Trump Towers many, many times. There is nothing but diversity working for you --
No.
I've seen it myself. I watch -- witnessed it myself. And then I watch these attacks against you, if it was me, I think I'd be pretty ticked off.
Well, you know, the one thing I see is that when you start to win -- and I've watched this not just for me, I've watched it over the years, when you start to win and win and win --
I know.
-- they have nothing to say. And they can't stop you. They always start using the racist word. And it's a very interesting phenomenon, but the word "racist " comes out. And that means that you're winning and that's their last chance. And I don't think it's working.
Right.
What an amazing guy he is, and his family, his wife, who's really such a -- an important part of the church. The -- the church was, I mean, packed, just, say, you know, it houses --
The answer to the question. Mr. Trump, thank you for being with us.
Thanks.
What did you think? How did you feel up there?
I felt great. I felt really good. I liked it. I enjoyed it. It was -- I thought it was a great debate.
Yes; I thought it was a passionate debate. One of the things I've been saying, this is a real choice election. You were highlighting she's going to raise taxes, regulations. You talked a lot about things that I've talked a lot about, repatriating money. How much do you think would come back overseas? How many jobs do you think would be created?
Well at least $2.5 trillion and many, many jobs, but at least $2.5 trillion. And again, she talks, you know, she's been talking for years but nothing ever gets done. It's all talk. So, I think I brought that out pretty well today actually.
Thirty years she's been there. That was a big point. What about the fact that she said, you pointed out, she said go to her website. She's going to raise $1.2 trillion in taxes.
Well I get more of a kick where she says go to my website, learn about how to defeat ISIS.
And buy her book.
Could you imagine this? How to defeat ISIS on a website. And, that's not the way to defeat ISIS believe me. How do you think General George Patton would feel about that? Go to his website. Do you think he'd have a website saying how he's going to defeat the enemy?
It was a moment where the second part of the debate. And they started talking about race, and you brought up that she had used that term super predator -- --
Super predator.
And then she tried to play the race card which her ads have done. Has that bothered you in the course of this campaign?
She used the word, well, you know, she's taken very dishonest ads. She's a very dishonest person. She took and used the word super predator and young black men. And I think it's a terrible term. And they don't like it and people, I guess, maybe they forget. Maybe they don't forget. But I did want to bring it up.
What about the issue, the also foreign policy? Another big part of this debate tonight. Iran, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, and her role -- --
You know, and I know she's been a disaster. And as you know, I used your name today because you and I used to argue about the war before the war. I thought this was before the war.
Do you know how many times we had conversations about that? And you told me that I was wrong, in fairness, for those people that are asking me in the media. You did tell me over, and over again I was wrong. And we did have passion, but we did have a respectable debate.
It was respectable and I understood where you were coming from. But I was against the war, I thought it would destabilize the Middle East. I didn't know it would be managed so badly in all fairness, and neither did you. But I really felt that it's something that had to be discussed. Because I was against the war in Iraq.
Let me ask you one last question if I can. Because, the whole issue of the birther controversy there was the Mark Penn memo that came out. There was a Sidney Blumenthal issue. There was a woman that worked in Texas for her. And then she acts like she had nothing to do with it.
Her campaign manager Doyle. No she had a lot to do with it. You know it and she knows it and her campaign knows it. And I think now the world knows it.
Last point, at the end of the debate, maybe a sign of desperation. She tried to attack you as sexist. What is your response to that?
Well I didn't want so say that her husband was in the room along with her daughter. Who I think is a very nice young lady. And I didn't want to say what I was going to say about what's been going on in their life. So I decided not to say it. I thought it would be very disrespectful to Chelsea and maybe to the family. But she said very bad things about me. I mean worse than what she's said. She's taking these phony ads, spending hundreds and millions of dollars on phony ads. And I think that it's a disgrace that she's allowed to do that.
Last question. About her and you and your differences. What do you take out of this debate going into your next debate?
Well she's never going to make America great again. It's very simple. It's just going to be more talk. You know, she talks like she's going to do childcare. She's going to do this, she's going to do that. She's been there for 26 years. For 26 years none of these have happened. Now all of a sudden they're going to happen. Not going to happen.
Mr. Trump, thanks for being with us. Appreciate it.
Thank you very much.
I got it.
Unless it's for her or her donors.
When she was Senator of New York, you were friendly with her though. She and her husband went to your wedding. We looked back and you weren't real critical of Hillary Clinton at the time. Did you think she was doing a good job back then?
Bill, I was a businessman. I was all over the world. I was doing great. And frankly I got along with all politicians. It was my job to get along with politicians. I didn't go around criticizing very many of them, almost none of them, because when you are a businessman you have to get along with the politicians, both Democrats and -- I get along with everybody. I get along with...
In your secret mind...
... Democrats, I get along with Republicans.
OK. And those of us in who know Manhattan know that's true. Now they are going to come after you, they being the Clinton campaign, on the statement that you made that you were smart for paying as few taxes as you could possibly pay. You know that's going to be in the next debate, it's going to be on campaign ads. Do you have any defense for that right now?
No, I didn't say that. What she said is maybe you paid no taxes. I said, well, that would make me very smart.
All right. I'm Hillary Clinton in the next debate. And I say to you what she said yesterday in North Carolina. Hey, if he's not going to pay any taxes and he thinks that's smart, what does that make us? We pay taxes. Are we stupid? How are you going to answer that?
Well, first of all, first of all, I never said I didn't pay taxes. She said, maybe you didn't pay taxes, and I said well...
I've got some more questions.
... to be honest with you -- yes. But I think that's the kind of thinking we need in our country.
I understand. They are coming after you.
We are going to spend some good money. But, I mean, you know -- and, by the way, those ads are largely false. There are so many inaccuracies in those ads. It's really, really a terrible thing.
All right, A, B, C, D?
Hillary Clinton with the gold standard -- Hillary Clinton on the gold standard. He didn't go after her even though she was wrong.
All right. Give him a grade.
C, C.
OK. He interrupted you 41 times and interrupted Hillary Clinton seven times.
Yes, I think he did.
That's bad. All right, now I'm going to flip around. If you get elected, one of the things that you are going to have to do to make America great again is restore respect for the country both overseas and here in America. You would agree with that, correct?
I agree 100 percent.
Last night Colin Kaepernick said another bad thing about his country. We're going to play it later on. He said bad stuff about you. You did own a professional football team. What would you do with Colin Kaepernick?
Well, I don't know what he said about me. But I think what is he doing is disgraceful. Is he starting yet or is he still a second string quarterback?
No, he's still second string guy. But what do you to him if you were the owner, what would you do?
He's making a tremendous amount of money. He's making a tremendous amount of money. He is leading the American dream. He's trying to make a point. But I don't think he is making it the correct way. Personally, if it was me, I would not be happy if I were the team owner, and I don't think I'm going to tell you what I would do. But I'll tell you...
But does he have the right to protest on your dime?
I would not be happy.
See, you are the owner. It's your stadium, all right, it's paying customers. It's your dime. This is right in your bailiwick, OK? So he's protesting on your dime, doing something that offends you. Would you take action again him?
I tell you it offends me, it does. Especially since is he doing so well in terms of economically and so many other ways. I guess he probably lost a starting position because something happened to him. He went down hill fast. And, frankly, that's OK. But I would not be a happy camper. I'm not going to tell you what I would do, but if...
You are not going to tell us?
... I was in that position I would do a lot different.
That's not like you though.
No, I'm not. And you know what, Bill, if I'm in that position, I would be a lot different than the way they are treating him right now. That I can tell you.
But it is not like you to not tell me what you would do. You usually are.
Well, you know, let's keep the headlines down to a minimum.
Then why did you not say to Hillary Clinton, hey, you jumped the gun by saying that we have -- this is deplorable, it's terrible, we have to solve this police problem, why didn't you go after her on that?
I think when she said deplorable about a tremendous portion of our country, I think -- and she said irredeemable, also. Not only deplorable, irredeemable.
Stay on the cops. Stay on Charlotte.
I thought it was disgraceful.
Yes, I thought you were going to bring that out.
I thought it was a very disrespectful answer to the police. There is no question about it. But I -- you know. You can only say so much in 22 seconds.
Yes. I know, we got that stat. But anyway, you got two more shots and she has got two more shots at you. And we always appreciate you coming on. We know you are busy going out to your rally right now and to make time for us is very nice of you to do it, thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Mr. Trump, I'm happy you haven't forgotten the admirals, of course.
I will never.
Any very good pilot can land on a carrier after they get the training.
After training.
The training is marvelous.
Because I understand it's a very, very special talent.
Negative.
And Tom Cruise?
You had mentioned that generals and the admirals and I wanna talk -- don't forget the sergeants, all right?
No that's what I'm talking about. We wanna get their advice also, believe me.
Can I just say one thing? Tony, we were talking last night, and one of the things that we are excited about is that you're beholden to nobody.
That's true.
I do and I have a clock down on the floor there that says two minutes.
OK.
Now, if you want me to call you when it goes over two minutes like...
I'll tell you what, I'll make a you a deal. If I'm doing well, don't call me. If I'm answering the question poorly, please call me immediately. In fact you can go...
OK.
You could go in 30 seconds, you could do it, all right.
All right.
All right.
All right.
OK, got it.
OK, the first question -- some of these I have the names and if I have the name I'll just ask the person to stand up. This is Matthew in Bedford, New Hampshire. Matthew.
Where is Matthew?
Matthew here.
Hi Matthew.
OK, Matthew says after the first debate, the media and even some within the party suggested that you should have gone after Hillary more. Did you hold back, and do you plan on criticizing her more this weekend?
Yeah, I did hold back. I thought it was just inappropriate to say what I was really thinking I would say. And I held back I think for good reason -- I think for good reason. I'd much rather have it be on policy and I didn't like getting into the gutter and so I did hold back. I also, I mean honestly, this was, you know, the commission, the so-called commission on presidential debates. Give me a break. Did you see where they came from? One of them comes from the Hillary camp, the head person.
You kept it at a minute twenty.
Good.
Is Charlene from Sanbornton around? Is she here?
Charlene. Hi.
Here we go.
How are you?
Doing well. Doing well.
We're keeping it down right.
Karen Whitaker, from here in Sandown, here in Sandown, Karen.
Hi, Karen. Thank you. Thank you. I like this audience. I like this audience.
Is Bob Swanson here? Bob Swanson?
Hi Bob.
We have some quick follow up, what would you do with Comey?
I just am very disappointed. I mean, you know, when he read the charges and he's going one, two, three, four, and I'm saying, wow, they're going to do the right thing. And then, he goes, essentially, however, it was, I mean, it was amazing -- it was amazing. To go after point after point, and that was only a few of them. So, it is very disappointing. It's very disappointing.
John Sununu.
That's true. I've watched him and I said, boy, he's tough.
Nate Silver.
Well, Nate Silver has been, you know, he didn't predict us in the primary and he had never called a loser before. I mean, you know, he's always been on the right side of what happened, in terms of at least his predictions and he didn't predict me in the primaries and in all fairness, you know, he's never seen me, never spoke to me, never saw what we did. You know, we had 17 very talented people and one by one by one, it was a beautiful sight to watch, wasn't it? Beautiful. And by the way, Howie, those people, most of them endorse me, Ben Carson, Chris Christie, so many of them endorse me and they are great endorsements. Scott Walker has been incredible.
That brings me to another question from Lois from Bretwood. Lois?
Thank you, Lois.
This one is unsigned but it's a good question.
That's trouble.
I think you've dealt with this one before. It's from Al Baldazaro over there.
Hello, Al.
I'm going to ask you the kind of question Hillary Clinton gets sometimes. I mean easy here.
She gets easy once.
That's what I mean.
Do you ever notice, by the way, did you see the difference. I'm getting boom, boom, boom, with here, what would you do to fix the economy? Well, of course, that's actually a much tougher question than you would understand, and she doesn't have a clue, but you see the questions I was getting.
I thought you needed a fun question.
Let's have a fun question.
So, joining us now from Dallas is Donald Trump. All right. First of all, you tweeted today, it is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me. And I can now fight for America the way I want to. What exactly does that mean?
Well, we've been having a problem. We have millions and millions of followers. We set records in the primaries. We have a group of people that want to see America be great again, and Paul Ryan, you know, open borders and amnesty and lots of other -- and bad budgets by the way, very, very bad budgets. Frankly, the only one that Obama negotiates well with is Paul Ryan with the budgets. Because that's the only negotiation he can win.
All right. All right. But what shackles did you have on? I mean --
The shackles are some of the establishment people that are weak and infective people within the Republican Party, senators and others and Paul Ryan, led to a certain extent by Paul Ryan.
They were holding you back? They were holding you back?
It's not a question of holding back, no. But they're not giving support. They don't give the kind of support. You know we got more votes, more than 14 million votes, more than anybody in the history of the Republican primaries, Bill, and they don't give the support that we really need.
OK.
Now, I think maybe I'm better off maybe without their support if you want to know the truth.
You might be. But I am so confused, you say, you say, OK, the shackles are off and now I can really do what I want. I mean, what are you going to do that you haven't done? I mean, are you going to be more outspoken?
I don't think I'm that outspoken to be honest with you.
Oh, come on! Sure you are.
No, I don't think, I think I've been very nice.
I didn't say you weren't nice. You're about as blunt as they come in political circles. That's why you won the primary.
I don't think so. Look, I went to Ivy League schools. I went, you know, I am not --
So did I, and look at the big mouth on me.
I think, I know, and look how we turned out.
All right.
She is a disaster.
When you --
And four more years of Obama, which will be worse than Obama, but four more years of Obama through Hillary Clinton, this country can't take it.
All right. I think you've gotten that point across. I think we all know that. So I want to go forward. I want to see what your forward strategy is. Four weeks from today, we'll all be voting. You're about six or seven percent down in the polling now, that's what's trickling out. Certainly, you could win. I think everybody, it was fair, you could win. But you're behind. So, let's start with risk assessment. Have you assessed how you're going to win back women who were offended by the recent exposition from "Access Hollywood"? Do you have a plan to get those women back?
Well, first of all, locker room talk, and most people have heard it before, and I've had a lot of women come up to me and said, boy, I've heard that and I've heard a lot worse than that over my life. And, you know, if that's why I'm going to lose an election to get rid of ISIS and to create strong borders and rebuild our military and do all the things we're going to do, including Supreme Court judges and saving the Second Amendment, because it's under siege with Hillary Clinton or as I call her Crooked Hillary, which is what she is. If that's what it's going to take to lose an election, I would be pretty sad then I have to go back to my other life.
All right.
But I will tell you what, I think we're going to win the election, Bill. I think we're going to win the election. People are tired of Obama and they're tired of Clinton.
You know, whether you believe it or not, that's what the polling says.
Yes.
Yes. It was an Obama policy, but remember, it's you know, when you're Secretary of State, I'm not making excuses, you're working for the boss. So now, let's get back --
Bill, Bill, hold it, Bill, you said I could interrupt.
Yes, go ahead.
OK. Just one time.
Yep.
I hope to not do it again. Just so you understand, there was no ISIS when Hillary Clinton came along.
Of course I understand that.
The way they got out of Iraq. So there was no ISIS, so there were no countries, now they're in 32 countries all over the world including by the way --
And that's on Obama.
She asked him -- no, it's also on her. She was Secretary of State.
A little bit. A little bit. But --
Not a little bit.
If you get elected president, you're going to tell your Secretary of State what to do and they'll do it or you'll fire them. But I want to get back to --
Bill, she was there at the beginning, she was there at the proud birth of ISIS.
I know.
So, I'm sure she was very proud of it.
OK.
She screwed up everything.
Now --
I mean, just there's nothing she hasn't screwed up.
Let me ask the question.
He was desperate to get my endorsement. I gave him the endorsement because he needed it for the primary, and frankly, he ran against a very, very good woman. I feel very badly, I gave him the endorsement. But that's OK.
All right.
He easily wins his primary. He easily wins his primary. And then all of a sudden, you know, he does the un-endorsement thing.
He didn't like the tape thing.
He's never heard, give me a break. He's never heard salty language before. You know, John McCain who has probably the dirtiest mouth in all of the Senate has never heard, you know, he talked about lewd --
Can I ask a question, please?
Sure.
If you're elected president, you're going to need McCain and you're going to need Ryan. You're going to need these guys.
They will be there. They will be there. I would think that Ryan maybe wouldn't be there. Maybe he will be in a very different position. But McCain will be there, they'll all be there.
And you think they'll going to all cooperate with you after you're trashing them?
I get along, I know you don't believe this. Well, I get along with you for 20 years, I guess I can get along with anybody, frankly. But to be honest with you Bill, I get along with people. And I think you know that maybe better than anybody, I get along with them.
I don't know what good it does to trash people. You can say I disagree, I wish they would endorse me, but to trash them, I don't know what good that does.
Because he was begging for my endorsement, people are calling --
I know --
His friends are calling. And then the first sign of a little bit of difficulty he unendorsed me.
All right.
I wouldn't want to be in a foxhole with a lot of these people, that I can tell you --
But McCain is a brave man. He is a brave man.
-- including Ryan. By the way, including Ryan. Especially Ryan.
All right. So, that was the most important --
She won't do anything. To me, that's the biggest thing.
OK.
Because she talks about -- she talks about health care, child care, she talks about everything, but she never does anything. You look at the bills she passed, a few naming projects. She named a couple buildings or highway or something. She did practically nothing. Hillary Clinton has been there and she criticizes and she says what she's going to do but she never does anything.
But she got some stuff, to be fair, after 9/11, she did a fairly good job representing New York and getting things in here that the families needed and the victims needed but I want to go to --
Well, she's not getting credit from my check, I will tell you that.
OK.
People think she was a lousy senator. She came in on the basis that she was going to fix Upstate, New York and create 200,000 jobs and guess what happened, everybody left.
OK. Now, Hillary Clinton just putting aside the compliments that she gave your children and by extension you. Did she say anything in that debate, and you know, try to be fair here, that impressed you anything that she have any point of view that was worthy?
Well, you know, I'm sure she said a couple of things, Bill, you know, you're asking me about the debate. I don't think I was extremely impressed with her performance. One thing I will say, you know, right after the debate they left and they said oh, Donald was in her space. I never walked near her. I was at my lectern and all of a sudden she walks right over to me, she stands right in front of me and the next day, I read that I was in her space. I watched Lazio lose the debate because he went over towards, stood over her. And that was years ago, I guess when they were running for Senate. Rick Lazio, nice guy. But he stood over and he took a lot of heat for that, so I very, you know --
I thought it was a bogus issue. I said it last night.
No, no, wait a minute, Bill, she came into my territory. No, no, she came into my territory. I was standing at my lectern --
Right.
And all of a sudden from nowhere, she walks right in front of me. So, I never walked near her. She stands right in front of me. The next day, it was I was in her space. I was standing at my chair, my lectern. So, this is typical Hillary Clinton. She's a phony person.
All right. But it was the press that did it and it was ridiculous. The whole thing was ridiculous.
No, it was the Hillary Clinton camp that spun the press, and the press is an extension of Hillary Clinton. I mean, it's part of the rigged system. The press is a total extension of look, if Hillary Clinton didn't have the press, she'd be right -- she wouldn't be running. She would have lost immediately. But if she didn't have the press on her side, and it's a total fix job. If she didn't have it, she'd be at 10 percent right now. Nobody wants her.
When you see how you're being treated, not only by the national press, but say "Saturday Night Live." You've got Alec Baldwin now doing you, Kate McKinnon doing Mrs. Clinton, do you feel that it's coordinated? There's no doubt that most of the press, and I said this from the very beginning, you remember I told you that the day you announced that you were going to get hammered personally, not just because of your policies, but because they don't like you, they don't think you're worthy for this job. You know, all of that.
No, they don't like what I stand for. They don't like what I stand for.
Yes. I understand.
They don't like, worthy, I mean, look, I'll compare my I.Q. with anybody, OK? So, they don't like --
But compare you to Romney. They didn't like Romney, but it wasn't as personal as it is against you. It's personal against you.
Well, I'm very proud to say, they say -- this is the all-time pile on in history in terms of -- you know, before I ran --
Coordinated, do you believe it's coordinated?
Hey, Bill, yes, I do think so. Before I ran, I used to get great press, my wife said the other day, she said you used to never got a bad story. Well, I got some, but I got very few. Now I have like, I can have -- I can be on the front page of The New York Times in three different stories, and every one of them is a hit job. And you understand that. Now, it's a very unfair press, but I knew it would be bad. I didn't know it would be this bad. I used to talk. I said, boy, am I going to get hit? Because I stand for strong borders. We have to strengthen up our country. We're not going to have a country if we don't have borders. And people are pouring across. By the way, ICE and the border patrol guards, border patrol agents just endorsed me, 16,500 agents.
Right. But that was a while back. But you missed an opportunity.
No, ICE -- no, no. ICE was last week, Bill, just so you understand.
It got overshadowed by the "Access Hollywood " stuff. I mean --
No, it did not. It wasn't overshadowed.
Well, let me just tell you. On Friday night --
They just --
Just let me tell you. On Friday night I'm sitting here doing a live show. I got WikiLeaks all day long on my show. And then all of a sudden an hour before airtime, the "Access Hollywood " thing explodes, so everybody is running around like this, you know, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum and the story got buried. And so, that's what happened on that one.
Bill, they should be speaking about what's going on in WikiLeaks. Just today, just before I put this on and shoot before your cameras, they have incredible stuff coming out even today. In fact, as soon as I'm finished, I am going to read it. But it was incredible stuff.
Yes, it was about the --
But nobody else is picking it up.
Well, we record it.
CNN which is totally crooked. You know, the Clinton News Network. CNN, first of all, their ratings are terrible. I don't know if you've seen them.
They're doing better. Because they're on Hillary's side and all that. But you're right. I am not going to dispute the fact that --
They're not doing better. They're doing badly in the ratings.
We've been fair.
There are people that frankly don't treat me fairly, but you've been fine.
I'm not rooting for anybody. I'm asking you the hardest questions I can ask you, and you sit there and answer them. And guess who doesn't answer them.
I do.
Guess who doesn't answer them.
Let me guess, is it Crooked Hillary?
I would never be disrespectful and call her that.
That's what she is.
She should, she should.
Yes.
Hi, Brit. He is just about to jump out to the stage, but we got an opportunity. Thank you for doing this, Mr. Trump.
Thank you.
So today, big news about the under secretary from the Department of State Patrick Kennedy. You know the details. Obviously upset about it. What do you want done?
Well, it's illegal, I mean what's taking place is illegal between Justice Department and the FBI and Secretary of State and the State Department. I think it's crazy what's going on. It's totally illegal. It's a criminal act. It's a crime. And I hear the Republicans are going to hold hearings after the election. Why would you hold them after the election? You want to hold those hearings before the election. But this is a criminal act. And it's incredible that they can do this and get away with it.
So there you go. Taking shots at Republicans again.
It's very disappointing. I mean, when you see that and you would say what's the purpose of holding them after. Now after is better than not having them, but, you know, we have 22 days. That is a long time. You would think you would hold these hearings frankly immediately. This is serious stuff. This is big stuff. This is Watergate.
We are in Wisconsin. Home of the House Speaker Paul Ryan who you have been having a battle with question, what is it about your differences and aggravation with the Republican Party? Are you trying to change the Party? Are you trying to lead and unite the Party? What's the goal here?
We are trying to unite the Party and we largely have it united. I mean, every once in a while Paul will stand up and say he disagree with this org that for instance when I talk about a rigged election, when I talked about the press, taking people with absolutely no case whatsoever and trying to put it on the front pages that in its form is a media rigging of the election. You look at certain areas of the country in terms of the voters and the votes and everything else and what's taking place. And illegal immigrants are voting and people that have died 10 years ago voting.
You have mentioned Philadelphia quite a bit.
Philadelphia is one that is mentioned. I think Romney got no votes and McCain got no votes. I mean like no votes. And Philadelphia is certainly one. You look at what is going on in Chicago. You look at what is going on in St. Louis and many other cities. There is tremendous voter fraud. And how Republican leadership doesn't see that is beyond me.
But you keep saying that the media is collectively working against you. Do you really think, we are part of a global conspiracy really, I mean, honestly a global conspiracy?
Fox hasn't been great. But the others have been really bad. Yeah. I would say that Fox certainly hasn't been great. But you have been better than some of the others I would say that is true.
You raised questions that the election could be rigged. We have a Republican Secretary of State who says it is virtually impossible to rig an election. Is this a dangerous message you are sending to people that the election might be rigged?
Yes, he is excellent by the way I have to tell you, and maybe in Ohio it's fine, but in many places throughout the country they do have problems, and I'm actually here to talk about it during my speech, and so I think you'll find it very interesting.
What is your evidence of that?
Well you have a lot of evidence of that, and I will be talking about that in my speech so you will watch.
Ohio Senator Rob Portman is one of the people who withdrew his support for you after the Access Hollywood tape came out. How much is it hurting you that these Republican leaders are trying to distance themselves from you?
Well I think they are doing themselves a tremendous disservice. We are actually up substantially in Ohio. We have tremendous support from the people. Uh, and I think they're doing themselves a tremendous disservice. We have a couple of cases where people who aren't supporting me. They are losing and I'm winning states, and you've seen that, that's all over the place. So you know, I was very disappointed in Rob, but he is free to do whatever he has to do. We're doing fantastically well in Ohio and Rasmussen just came out -- the poll -- we're three up nationwide, and IBJ just came out and we're one up and that was the most accurate poll of the season last year. So I think we are doing really well.
Last night it was pointed out in the debate that your financial plan -- experts say -- would put America in a worse position than those of Hillary Clinton, even though she's not getting high marks either. Do you agree with that?
No I totally disagree. We're going to lower taxes substantially for Ohio and everybody else. Our taxes were the highest taxed action anywhere in the world, so we are gong to lower taxes, very very substantially. We are also going to lower business taxes. The businesses now are leaving. They are going to Mexico and everywhere else because the taxes are so high. When we do this massive tax cut, this massive regulatory cut which is a tremendous problem, we're going to have jobs coming back. We have a GDP of around one percent. You saw the last quarter it was around one percent which is record setting low. Almost record setting lows. Look, we are going to have a tremendous GDP. It's going to be four percent, maybe four and a half percent. If that happens, then our nation will be booming again. We have the weakest recovery in our nation since the depression since the great depression. People are looking for jobs. Look at the kind of crowds we are getting, for example right here. They are looking for help. They are looking for the jobs. Our manufacturing has been stripped out of our country. Our jobs have been taken out of our country. So my plan is lowering taxes. Hillary Clinton wants to raise taxes. They don't like her plan very much.
But yet the experts say your plan is the one that really won't work?
My plan will work. The experts are not really experts. They've been wrong so much over the years. My plan is the largest tax cut since Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan's plan worked. Mine is similar. I think my tax cut could even be a little bit larger, but I think it's going to work, and it's going to be great, and its going to put people back to work, and its going to stop companies from leaving Ohio and other places.
19 days out from the election, you've been labeled a racist, you've been called a sexist, how...
Thank you very much.
How do you respond to that?
I am the least racist person you've ever met.
Joining us now with details, 2016 Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Mr. Trump, how are you?
I'm very good, thank you, Sean.
Yes.
And so you have really clear choice. You have a very, very distinct choice.
Yes.
And you know what? It's no way -- it's no way that it should be. We're supposed to be a great democracy. It's no way that it should be. I mean, a certain magazine wrote some horrible things. I guess it came out today. Nobody reports. I'm not going to get involved in it, but nobody reports it.
Well, I actually reported it...
But if somebody calls up the newspaper and says just one thing, they make a big deal out of it.
How does CNN...
Never, ever happened!
How does CNN put the woman on for 45 minutes, and then the guy that was sitting next to you...
I think it's a disgrace.
... they don't even ask him one question?
It's the most rigged system I've ever seen. And I've been talking about it for a long time. And it was rigged against Bernie Sanders and it's rigged even more against me.
Well...
It's a disgrace.
By the way...
They poison -- they poison the voters with this kind of stuff and this kind of junk that never happened!
Well, by the way...
It's not like a question, like, it may have. It never -- none of it ever happened!
You're doing it in Gettysburg.
Right.
All right...
... a special day at a special place.
Did you have fun at the Al Smith dinner? Did you mind getting booed a little bit?
I did. No, I -- look, we -- we say what's true, and some people don't like hearing it, but we say what's true.
Yes, they...
No, that's OK. It was a great dinner. It was a great dinner. No, I enjoyed it. I thought it was great.
All right. Did you get in trouble when you went home to Melania last night?
No, I didn't. She was great. She understood. It was -- that was probably the moment of the evening. People loved it.
All right, Mr. Trump, have fun on the campaign trail. I know you got a lot more to get to today. Appreciate your time.
Thank you. Thank you very much, Sean. tha
We have with us Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump's on the phone from... Where are you, sir? Where are you calling from right now?
Well, I'm right now in Miami, Rush, and I just visited two voting areas, and they are packed. They're two-blocks long with people voting.
Mr. Trump, I want to make an observation and get your reaction to it. We have some, I think, devastating news for the American people today, and that's what's happening with health care premiums.
Absolutely.
They're throwing out everything they can to destroy you and to prevent you from winning, and you keep hanging in there. What is your plan these next two weeks to take this to the finish line?
Well, one thing we're going to do is talk just about that: Obamacare, jobs. Our jobs are being taken away from us, Rush. Companies, as we speak, are signing documents with Mexico and other places to move. Our jobs be being... Look at Ford two weeks ago. Ford Motor. They're gonna make all of their smaller cars in Mexico. They're gonna move everything outta here. And so many... I mean, Carrier air-conditioners. I talk about all these companies. There are hundreds of companies. They're moving out to Mexico and other countries. Obamacare is a disaster. And you remember, I called that from before it was approved. I said, "This can't work, because it's just... The plan is no good. The concept is no good, " and it turned out to be much worse.
Well, the problem is, it is working. It is working, by design. The whole point of this was to have it fail like this so that they can then have people panic and ask the government to fix it, and the government will fix it by going single payer with the government totally running the health care system, which gives them so much power over people and their behavior and the way they live their lives, you don't even want to think about it.
Well, if they do that, Rush, they'll have an even worse situation than they have now. You know, if you look at even Canada, the people come down. When they want an operation, they come to the United States to get the operation. You look at what's going on. It is a disaster in terms of cost, of course... And, you know, the 25%, Rush, is less than half of what the real number is. The real number in some of these places is 80% to 90% increases. It's catastrophic, actually.
It is.
They put out the phony number of 25% because 25% sounds better than 60 or 70%.
Well, you know, the former head of the Democrat National Committee, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, is out there saying, "Oh, no. It's been much worse. Bush was destroying the health care system. Obamacare, all it's like doing is keeping prices from going up more rapidly." I mean, it's frustrating, Mr. Trump, because their fingerprints, as I say, are all over this. If anybody, in my estimation, is disqualified from having anything further to do with this nation's economy or health care or immigration, it's the Democrat Party. And you have absolutely... There's not one thing going wrong in this country they can blame you for, and yet they're trying to tell everybody that you're the one not qualified, that you're the one not fit. What has this been like for you personally? I mean, you're a winner.
Right.
You choose to go after -- people say, "No, no, Mr. Trump, stick to the issues. Don't let them sidetrack you that way."
Hello?
What is your thinking on --
Well, I think we got cut off.
Well, and what I was saying before we got cut off is that a lot of public figures have different ways of dealing with it. Some ignore it hoping not to amplify it. You obviously, in your life when somebody's come after you, wounded you, you go right back at them, and then people say, "Mr. Trump, stick to the issues, don't be distracted like this."
Right.
Well, you have to be who you are, and I think one of the things that has so many people so excited for you is that you do fight, is that you do fight back.
Well, I'd like to at least, you know, make a statement about the truth. And even if that delays it a day or two, in other words, then they have to print the statement and they don't talk about jobs and Obamacare, right. You know, but honestly, I mean, people have to know your view. They have to know that this stuff never took place, it was total fabrication. So I would rather do it that way, but a lot of people disagree with me, Rush. You may be one of the few that don't.
Well, I believe in people being who they are, and you are obviously who you are, and I think people should stay who they are. You're not a phony in any way, shape, manner or form. You've got, Mr. Trump, so many people --
Hello?
Your support, I mean, you see it at all of your rallies.
Steve!
It's voluminous and it's deep.
The phone is dead.
I don't know if you have an idea how many people love you and are depending on you and hoping you win here.
Steve, get me a phone, quick!
Well, no, no fault. I know you've got to split soon and leave for -- where are you going next from Miami?
We're going to different places all throughout Florida. Our next stop is Sanford, Florida. We have a tremendous crowd. Last night we had 25,000 people in Tampa. I don't know if you saw last night, Rush, it was unbelievable.
It really is. I was gonna tell you before we got disconnected the last time, you see your crowds, you know how many people are showing up, I think there are millions more people than you even know behind you, praying for you, urging you on, hoping and praying you win. It's phenomenal the kind of support you have behind you, despite the best efforts to suppress it, and those efforts are being made, I think it's profound, the number of people.
Well, they're doing a tremendous suppression effort, but so far I will tell you, when you look at where the voting booths are, you know, the voters, we pass, I told you before, we passed three of them. They're two and three blocks long of people standing there waiting to vote, and four years ago they'd have two people in the room and everybody's falling asleep. The voting -- the lines are unbelievable getting into the polling places and the voting booths. So, you know, hopefully that's a great sign, and these I think are real Trump people. These are people that want to see America be great again. That's what it's all about.
Yeah, because right now the insurance companies are forbidden by law in competing state to state. They have to stay within state --
Right.
-- so people in certain states are subject to very little competition, which means they have no hope of having --
The concept, Rush, of health care savings accounts and, you know, other concepts off of that, but, you know, I'm totally serious. You will have plans that nobody's even talking about now because it'll get more and more competitive, more and more ideas will come out, and the costs will drop so incredibly, it will be an incredible thing to watch. We are absolutely being choked. Businesses are closing. I think Obamacare has now taken over almost from regulation, which is ridiculous what's happening with overregulation, as the biggest single problem for opening and keeping businesses going.
Oh, they do! Mr. Trump, they do! They understand exactly what the media is doing to you. Your fan base, your support base is loyal beyond I think --
Amazing. I love 'em. I love 'em.
Well, thanks for your time today. I appreciate it, and good luck the rest of the way, sir.
Well, thank you. We're gonna be working very hard, and we'll speak to you on the 9th. Hopefully we've have a happy conversation.
Oh, I look forward to it -- look forward to it.
Thank you, Rush. I appreciate it.
We will see. My priority is my son, Barron, our son, Barron. And -- I support him 100 percent, and I'm there for him every time he needs me. And -- I might join him. We will see.
And she's actually going to make two or three speeches.
Made some news right there.
No, it is. It's -- she's amazing when she speaks. She's amazing. And it's not what she does. I mean, she was very, very successful, but not as a public speaker. She's an amazing public speaker, so -- she's agreed to do two or three speeches. And I think it's going to be big speeches, important speeches.
You mentioned b --
And I think it's gonna be great.
Yes, all the time. He ask me about the polls all the time, and --
It's very cute.
It's like his dad, he follows the polls --
How is he doing in the polls?
That comes with the territory though, doesn't it?
No, no, no. Look, I went to an Ivy League school. I was a good student. I'm a very smart person. I -- I know what I'm saying. Now, there have been some instances where I could have done it a little bit differently, but sometimes I'll say something that's absolutely perfect, and I'll get a call after an interview like with you, "Oh, did you say this or that?" And they'll skew it so unfairly.
But people see it for themselves, they make up their own minds --
Well, they don't really. Because what happens is you poison their minds. You really do. The media poisons the mind of the American voter. They really do, it's unfair. But the thing is, the American voter is really smart. I mean, I'm gonna see how smart they are. But the American voter, I -- I think the American voter is smarter than the media.
Yes, I believe that. And because to accuse somebody -- without evidence, it's very hurtful, and it's very damaging and unfair. And -- but honestly, do we still need to talk about that? I think American people wanna hear the problems that we have in America.
She's so right about that. She's so right about that --
They -- they -- they wanna hear what we will do to make America better. Let's talk about jobs. Let's talk about secure our border. That's what American people wanna hear about it --
I think -- I think -- people -- just to finish, I can't apologize for something I didn't do. That nothing ever took place --
But it's more likely to go away if you don't sue.
We'll see what happens, OK? Let's see what happens on the 8th, November 8th.
I'm sure you've seen this --
-- and it's very dangerous for children.
-- the New York Times, what, it had three or four pages, all the people they say you've insulted on Twitter --
Well, that's OK. That's OK. Most of 'em deserved it. Were you one of 'em?
Thank you --
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Mr. Trump, thank you for doing this.
Thank you.
So 13 days to go. How do you pull this out?
Well, I think we're doing very well. The new polls just came out. We're leading in Florida. If you look at the lines and -- all of the people standing on lines in the state of Florida, it's incredible. I just had last night, as you know, I was in Tallahassee. We had 25,000 people. We had 16,000 people the night before. We're -- we're have, I mean, if I have a crowd less than 15,000 people it's considered a small crowd. There's never been anything like that. Now after this I'm going to North Carolina where we're also doing very well. The polls are indicating that we're leading in Florida, we're leading in North Carolina, we're leading in Ohio.
Well, there -- there's a new Bloomberg poll out in Florida that shows you had that as absolutely true. But almost every poll -- public poll in Florida and North Carolina taken since the first debate shows her ahead.
Yeah, but all of the most recent ones, and if you look at the enthusiasm on the lines, what they're now talking about are the lines. Because you have early voting in Florida. And the enthusiasm on the lines is unbelievable.
So you're not fighting from behind?
George, I think I'm gonna win. I mean, what can I tell you? I think I'm gonna win. I -- I really believe that we've gotten a very unfair narrative from the press. I feel the press is very dishonest. I don't feel. I know the press is very dishonest. And I think we're going to win. I think we're gonna win Florida. I think we're gonna win Ohio. You know, it used to be if you win Florida, you win Ohio, you win. We're gonna win North Carolina, we're gonna win a lot of states.
You're gonna win all three of those?
Yeah, I -- I think I will. I think I will.
And what do you say --
And I think we'll win a lot more than that. We just got great numbers on Wisconsin, as an example. I think we're gonna win a lot more than that.
I did the first interview of this campaign on the first day, Trump Tower.
You did.
And we're --
That's right.
-- here in a Trump Hotel --
That's right.
It sends a message, front page of the Wall --
No, it sends -- you know what it does, it sends a real message, George, because we have road projects and tunnels and all the things we're doing. And they're costing three, four times what they were supposed to cost and they never get finished.
Front page of the Washington Post today says you're not gonna have any more fundraisers this campaign. She is definitely gonna outspend you in the home stretch. To avoid that, are you willing to write a check to your campaign?
Yeah, I am. I mean, look, I'm gonna be in for over $100 million.
Only $56 million so far.
Well, no, it's 61. But I'm spending a lot of money. And that doesn't include everything. I'm spending a lot of money. And, look, she's spending nothing. She ripped off the country for $250 million. She spends -- she has no money invested in her campaign. Zero. Fact, I asked her at one of the debates, I said, "Why aren't you putting up ten or 20 or 15 or something million dollars?" And she didn't respond.
How much more are you gonna put up between now and election day?
I would say a lot. I'm not gonna say what. But I will be over $100 million and it could be much more than that.
You've talked a lot about the fact that you think this election could be rigged. I wanna go back to 2012. You sent out a tweet --
I think the system is rigged.
-- election night --
I think the system is rigged.
But you called the --
It's so --
If --
Now -- now I will say this, that's a very unfair statement. What should really be -- they should be talking about WikiLeaks and the horrible things that have come out about Hillary Clinton. The horrible things. They should talk about the FBI getting paid six -- I mean, the -- the head investigator getting paid $675,000, the wife, for a campaign contribution. Essentially from her best friend. You know that better than anybody. And she's under investigation and this is the man that's the head of the investigation? And the wife is getting paid $675,000?
Contributions to her campaign all before --
Oh that's a --
-- he took it over.
-- terrible thing. That's a terrible thing. Nobody's ever seen anything --
Let -- let's --
-- like that.
-- take on this election idea.
And George, she's so guilty she -- she deleted 33,000 emails. They're missing boxes of emails. She's so guilty. How can she even run? You have to see, there's such anger in this country. And the anger is about that. But there is such anger in this country over what she got away with.
The FBI director, appointed by Republicand has said, "No reasonable prosecutor would bring this case."
Well, he's -- he made a mistake. OK? Or -- or whatever. I -- I won't -- I don't even call it a mistake. I think something happened. Look, something happened. You --
What happened?
-- Well, I think somebody talked to him. I think -- hey, look, how can President Clinton when --
So you're saying --
-- the attorney general --
You --
-- fo -- George, General Cartwright, four-star general, could go to jail, think of this, for five years --
-- you've made the point that you think --
-- and Petraeus' life has been destroyed --
-- you've made the --
-- great general.
-- point that you think she's guilty. But if she does -- I know you think --
I -- no, no, I don't think she's guilty. I know she's guilty.
-- if -- if she wins -- I know you think you're gonna win. But if she wins -- if she gets the kind of win that President Obama got, more than 300 electoral votes, several million in the popular vote, will you accept that --
George, I've said --
All 17 --
-- about voting for --
-- U.S. intelligence agencies believe the Russians are behind that leak. Why don't you believe it?
I don't know if they're behind it. And I think it's -- public relations, frankly. Do you know what does bother me? I have nothing to do with those --
But you were even told by the --
-- George, George, let me explain some --
-- Republican head of the homeland security --
-- let me explain something.
-- Mike McCaul, he said the same thing.
I don't know what he said.
He told you that he thought the Russians were behind it.
Hacking is very interesting. Hacking is very hard to determine who did what. OK? You know that. People are hacking all over the place and nobody knows. They don't know if it's Russia. They can't guarantee it's Russia. And it may be. I mean, it may be Russia. I have nothing to do with Russia. She likes to put the narrative about Donald Trump with Russia. I have nothing to do with Russia. I don't owe money. I don't have deals in Russia. I don't know Putin.
So you want --
-- classified emails --
-- you want a special --
-- the whole thing, I'll tell you what, the whole thing is a scam. And it's horrible.
-- you want a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton. So now President Obama should be investigated as well? That's what you said yesterday.
No but President Obama made the statement that he didn't know anything about it. But in the meantime he's getting emails. So it proved that he did know about it.
You said yesterday he should be investigated -- you said --
Who should be investigated?
-- by the -- the president.
Let them do whatever they want. Look, he knew. He lied. He certainly lied. Because he knew the emails because they were sent to him.
Let's talk about Mosul.
And that was a big deal yesterday. I mean, you do agree that was a big deal yesterday.
It was new -- it was news yesterday. It was --
It was news. It was news.
She said you're declaring --
But here's the other problem. Wait, wait --
-- defeat before the battle is over.
-- let me -- let me finish with Mosul. Element of surprise. One of the reasons they wanted Mosul, they wanted to get ISIS leaders who they thought were, you know, in Mosul. Those people have all left. As soon as they heard they're gonna be attacked, they left. The resistance is --
On Saturday you said that you'd threaten to sue the 11 women who've accused you of sexual assault.
You know, I hate that you waste time when we're talking about ISIS and we're talking about jobs and you're still bringing that up. Everybody wants to bring it up. Look --
That was just Saturday.
-- these were false attacks. These things never happened. These people -- I don't know these people. These things never, ever happened. This was out of the blue. It was made up probably by the Clinton campaign.
Do you have any evidence of that?
Well, many of their stories have already been debunked. Many of the stories have already been debunked as you know.
People Magazine story, they brought forward six witnesses to --
Why didn't she write the --
-- corroborate the story.
-- story 12 years ago?
She says she was afraid.
Oh she was afraid. Give me a break. She was afraid to write it, she would have gotten the Pulitzer Prize. Give me a break. She was afraid. And she had the butler as a witness, right, who no longer works for me. So she had the butler as a witness except for one problem --
Six corroborating wit --
-- excuse me. Excuse me. There was nobody corroborating. They said years later she talked about it. Look, the butler -- she said -- was there. One problem, the butler said it never happened. He doesn't work for me. No longer.
He did.
He's a good man. By the way, he's a good man. But he hasn't worked for me in years. They went to the butler. He said it never happened. Nobody --
So all of these women --
-- reported that.
-- everyone they talked to are lying?
They made up stories. You know why? Fame or they wanted to help Clinton or something. They made up stories.
They came out after you denied your --
George.
-- behavior.
George, George, let's not waste any more time. These stories were fabricated. They're total lies.
So you're gonna go through with the lawsuit.
We'll find out. Let's see what happens with the election. We're gonna find out. But I'm just telling you, these stories are total lies and you shouldn't be wasting time. And remember this, why didn't you write about the butler? You knew about the butler refuting her story. Why didn't anybody write it? It's a very unfair press.
One of your toughest critics on this is the First Lady Michelle Obama. She says your behavior, your words are cruel. They are frightening. This is not how decent people behave. This is not how people who wanna be president behave.
Well, what's she gonna say? Is she gonna say I'm wonderful? Now, look, she made the statement about Hillary Clinton. I've heard this statement for years. I had no idea it was Michelle Obama. She made the statement that, "If you can't take care of your own house, you can't take of the White House." You know, I've heard that statement for years --
But what do you think about --
Now all of a sudden --
You do sound --
-- a little bit --
-- pretty energized today. When you look back over the sweep of this campaign going back to -- to last June, is there anything you regret?
Oh absolutely. I'd love to have done certain things over. But you can't. You can't. But that's, George, life. I'd love to have -- have done in life certain things over, I guess. And you would have too.
Let me just bring one specific --
And I think most importantly I think we're g -- you know, this is a movement, like, that's never happened in this country. Even you will admit that. Even your friend, Bill O'Reilly said it's the most incredible thing he's ever seen in politics. OK. And it's -- a lot of it's because of the movement, because of the -- there is tremendous spirit out there for change.
Do you --
People want change.
-- do you think you should've apologized to the Khans or Judge Curiel?
I have great respect for the Khan family. I have great respect for, I mean, the son is a great hero. But if I were president at that time, Captain Khan would be alive today, George. Because I wouldn't have been in Iraq. So if I were president Captain Khan's son would be --
You did support it initially.
-- support --
The invasion.
-- I never -- support -- look, look, let's get it straight. I was opposed to the war in Iraq. I was opposed to the war in Iraq. And for the most part the honest people agree with it. Right from --
But the tape --
-- the beginning I was --
-- Howard Stern's tape was pretty clear.
-- opposed now and that was way before the war started. And that was the first time I was ever even asked about Iraq and I gave a very, like -- I don't know. Who knows?
We'll see. Mr. Trump, thanks very much.
Thank you very much.
First, I want to ask you about your event here. There's a new audio tape of you talking about the fact that you really have relied on your popularity and the fact that people come to your events, and that helps you with free advertising. Is that what this was about?
No, not at all. This was just under budget, ahead of schedule. That's what this is. Under budget, ahead of schedule. We built a hotel that is going to be one of the great hotels of the world. Just opened today. It officially opens today, and we built it for less money than was anticipated and we built it ahead of schedule by over a year. And if the country would do that, we would have a country that would be in much better shape than it's -- you know, highways, they build highways for double and triple the cost, they build hospitals --
So, but to do that, you have a pretty big bank account, and time is running out. The clock is ticking. Will you write a check --
I've already written a number of them.
But specifically to get up on the air to combat the ads that you say Hillary Clinton is running against you?
Well, in Florida, she has 50 to 1 against me. Fifty. You were the one that told me that.
Can you just be specific how much are you willing to put down in order to put up new ads?
No, I will have over $100 million in, I'm willing to invest more than that.
Like how much?
Don't -- let's go with your next question, Dana.
I'm Bill O'Reilly. Thanks for watching us tonight. The "TALKING POINTS" memo on new information about the Clinton Foundation will be in our third segment tonight and it is worth hearing. We've uncovered some new information as well as now knowing what the hackers found out about the foundation. Please stay tuned for talking points. But first, the top story, tonight in an interview with Donald Trump, some polls say he is closing in on Hillary Clinton with 12 days to go before the vote. Mr. Trump joins us now from Ohio. So, let's begin with the rigged business. How exactly do you think the election is rigged?
Well, the system is rigged, Bill. You look at the media, how horrible they are, how false they are, how negative they are toward me. I think 93 percent of the stories they write are like negative, even if it's a positive story, they'll always find a way to make it negative. And, you know, I'm not quite used to it, because I used to get credit publicity, now, no matter what you do, it doesn't make any difference, but the system is rigged. And I think the biggest rigging of all is what's happened with the FBI and the justice department with respect to Hillary Clinton, because she is so guilty in so many different ways that she shouldn't even be allowed to run for president. So, right there the system is really rigged.
OK. What about --
She should not be allowed to run for president.
Yeah, they have been documented things there. But, on a mass level --
But for years I've been hearing.
-- on a mass level, you don't believe that 120 million American votes that the thing is going to be dishonest, do you believe that?
Well, I looked at Pew Research, highly respected, and there are 1.8 million people who are dead who are registered to vote, and some of those people vote. So, I wonder how that happens.
All right. But, you know -
There are 2.8 million -- wait a minute, Bill. There are 2.8 million people who are registered in two states. That's not so good that means you vote in two states. I mean, there are things that are going on, Bill. I watched President Obama eight years ago on Fox, actually, just the other night, but I watched President Obama eight years ago, talking about how Chicago is rigged, that's basically, he was doing it with a wink, but he was essentially saying that -
Now, mentioning President Obama -
Well, he actually said it happened.
What do you think about that?
Well, her husband did it eight years ago. Her husband said, basically, those same words eight years ago, complaining about the system in Chicago and laughing about it, and I think he said something to the effect like, he's lucky he's in Chicago because it's rigged in his favor. Well, take a look at it, I saw it on Fox, and I thought it was terrible especially since now he is holier than thou and, you know, like a thing like this could never happen. But go back eight years when he was running for the first time, and you'll see some pretty nasty statements.
Her message is that you're undermining the desire of people to vote. Do you buy that?
I think the opposite. In Florida, there are lines that are record lines, they have never had anything like it, four blocks long to vote. In other places, I hear in different places, I'm hearing reports that are incredible, I hope they are voting for me, but I think they're voting for me. They have a lot of Trump caps on, that I can tell you, but they have record lines. So we're going to see what happens. Right now, I'm in -- I'm right now in Ohio, and I'll tell you what, it's incredible, the enthusiasm and the crowds and the whole thing is incredible --
Yeah, you're slightly -
-- I think we're going to do great in Ohio.
According to polls, you're slightly out in front in Ohio. Now, do you believe the polls are rigged? Do you think certain news organizations and other organizations, when they poll, have their thumb on the scale and they want Hillary Clinton to come out on top in the poll? Do you believe that?
Oh, absolutely. I have no doubt about it.
Which ones?
I won -- look, I won the third debate, easily. It wasn't even a contest and everybody had me winning. Every poll had me winning, big league, and then CNN did a poll, and they had me losing, somewhat. And I said, "How did that happen?", I wonder. And then there were other polls that were -- look, I mean, I'm winning in certain polls, and then in other polls, the dirty polls, we call them, I was losing by, you know, numbers that were ridiculous.
I don't know.
In a day or two.
I can barely add to 20.
No, look, these polls --
I don't know.
These polls -- look, the only one I really like are the ones where I'm winning. But these polls --
Oh, you're honest there.
These polls are definitely -- hey, Bill, something's going on. Bill, something's going on with the polls, and what they do it's called suppression.
All right, well -
A tremendous dishonesty.
We got to find it -- we got to -- we're definitely the day after the debate, we're going to -- I mean, the election we're going to analyze who was accurate and who wasn't.
Well, that's the poll that matters. That's the only poll that matters.
So, it's possible you might?
But I will -- I will say first of all, it shouldn't have been said, but it was, you know, it was locker-room talk. And, yeah, I mean, you know, we're going to find out soon enough. I will tell you.
All right. Obamacare, not doing well, I think any measure, any fair-minded person would say a lot of Americans are getting hurt. You have to pay more for their premiums, more deductibles, they're getting their choices of doctors filed down. It doesn't seem though that the democratic base, which wanted Obamacare so much, cares. They don't seem to care, you don't see an outrage building on the left about Obamacare. I'm wondering if you know why that is.
I think they care. I think people care. I think people are getting wiped out. The state of -- which is just an amazing place, I'm going there in two days, the great State of Arizona,116 percent increase. I think they're going to care when they actually see the bills start pouring in, and the numbers they gave, you know, 24, 25 percent increase, I don't believe that. I think the minimum is going to be 40 percent and 50 percent. Yeah, I think the people are going to care.
Well, her birthday was yesterday. Who knows? Let's see what happens.
She is 69. I think we're doing very well.
Yeah, she's OK. She's all over the place.
Yeah, I don't care. Look, there's something going on, and I don't know what's happening, but I can tell you this is a -- she goes away for three, four, five days and she doesn't leave the house, and then she comes back. And the interesting thing is, I had eight stops over the last day, and funny she said, yesterday we opened a great hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. I went to cut a ribbon real quick, she said, "Donald Trump is off the path." OK, you know, off the path, give me a break. It's probably the first time I've done anything outside of this, like in a month, but, you know, I wanted to check on the work. We built a great hotel, by the way, under budget, ahead of schedule. That was one of the reasons I wanted to be there. Under budget, ahead of schedule, this country does not do that.
All right. And we really appreciate it, we know how busy you are, as far. I hope you come back next week, the last week and talk to us again, Mr. Trump.
Good.
Thank you very much.
I will.
All right.
Thank you, Bill. Thank you.
Great! Mr. Trump, thanks for the time.
Thank you.
I want to start with your mother, Mary Trump, who we hear very little about; but, you said she had a flair for the dramatic. What do you see in yourself that you saw in her?
Maybe that... she was a... she was a terrific woman -- beautiful woman. She was born in Scotland, came here at 19 years of age; met my father; they got married. They were married for 63 years or something, and they had a great marriage. It was very beautiful, but she was a very, very smart woman. And she was a very religious woman, actually.
Tell me -- we're talking about women. There's been a lot of confusion, controversy out on the trail. When I travel the country, people say, "I'd like to vote for Donald Trump, but I don't think I can look my wife and my daughter in the eye if I did so." They're reacting to those Billy Bush comments and the reaction to some of these people who are accusing you across the country. What do you say to them?
Well, that never happened -- those were artificial. They were made up, just like at the rallies, where they made up, you know, they brought the protesters in. They paid them. They were thugs, and they, you know, they paid them, I guess, $1,500 or something and an iPhone. That was artificial, and, actually, criminal, what they did. And nobody understood it at the time, and it was put in there by the Clinton campaign. This stuff was all made up. And so, I protested it. And, actually, witnesses have come forward, and much of it's already been debunked, but it was all made up.
What do you say to those who still have lingering concerns? Have you changed since those comments were made... a decade ago?
Well, it was locker-room talk; it was locker-room talk. The microphones, I mean, to be honest, should, you know, should never have been on, but that was locker-room talk. And it's just one of those things. I have it. I've said it. I've made my apologies, but again, just one of those things.
I want to read something Newt Gingrich recently said about you. He said, "He is a transformational figure, but one that reacts very intensely, almost uncontrollably, to anything that attacks his own sense of integrity." Do you regret some of the reactions you've made over this election season and perhaps the way you phrase those reactions?
Well, you know, I started with 17 people, and it was a very, very nasty primary, and they were nasty to me. You know, people think I was nasty, but they were nasty to me, and I ended up winning, you know; one in 17 -- and it was actually 18, if you want to be exact. And then, I have the final now with Hillary Clinton, and I hear we're doing very well in the polls, and we're doing very well in Florida, which is up now. The reaction has been amazing. So we'll have to see what happens. But, no, look -- you can't go back. You have to look forward. This was a nasty campaign, and, you know, people don't mention, but they were nasty to me. I think, in many cases, they were nastier to me than I was to them.
And, as a president, you wouldn't react that way?
No, I don't think so. It depends; you react a different way for different people. These were 17 people coming at me from every angle, and, you know, I hit them hard. Most of them are now endorsing me. Some of them dishonored the pledge: They signed a pledge, and they dishonored the pledge, and they'll have to live with that. But most of them have endorsed me.
I want to get into some issues.
OK.
You weren't always pro-life, but you now are determinedly and decidedly pro-life.
Yes, I am pro-life.
You said you are going to appoint judges who are pro-life.
Right.
You're very concerned about the late-term abortions. What was the moment that changed your thinking, your heart, on this?
Well, there are a number of moments, but one was a couple that I know very, very well -- and you had a strong pro-life (person) and you had a strong pro-choice (person), and they argued over (the pregnancy).... The mother was pregnant. They argued over the child. One, I won't get into specifics.
Sure.
But one wanted to abort. And the other said, "We can't do that. We're not going to do that." Anyway, they had the baby. It was a long time ago. And the baby is such a magnificent person, who I know, a magnificent person. And the person that was actually pro-choice is now pro-life because of it, and it had a big effect on me. But I've seen other examples similar to that; but I've seen other examples, so...
So, it was a personal change for you?
It is a personal change. And, you know, Ronald Reagan made that personal change, too. Many people have made the personal change. I mean, some make the personal change the other way, also.
Right; right.
But I made the personal change, and I'm very happy with it.
Tell me about religious liberty. I know this is becoming a growing concern for you, particularly for so many faith-based voters and people who are in nonprofits...
Right.
Religious-service people.
Right.
Whether it's the Little Sisters of the Poor or, you know, these private businesses who are religiously motivated, they feel this Obamacare mandate, which demands contraceptive and abortifacient services, as part of insurance...
Right.
... is intrusive.
Right.
What would you do as president?
Well, let me tell you: Religious Liberty itself, taken in the biggest picture, is in tremendous trouble. OK? I mean, religious liberty in this country is in tremendous trouble.
You mean expression of religion?
I'm talking expression, and I'm talking anything else you want to talk about. People that are faith-based are not having, you know, they're just not having, they're not being accepted. It's almost like they're not being accepted in our country anymore. Obama has been a disaster, in terms of religious liberty. And, one of the things I'm very proud of: I was with pastors, ministers, priests, rabbis, on numerous occasions, large numbers; and at the first meeting, I could see I had tremendous support like, beyond.... And I said, "When are you going to endorse me?" And they said, "We can't do that." And I said, "Why can't you do that?" They said, "We're not allowed to do that. If we did that, we'd lose our tax-exempt status."
Right.
And I said, "Why is that?" And they told me about the Johnson Amendment, 1954. And I thought about it for a month. And we had a meeting again -- 56 different pastors, ministers, etc., and I said, "We're going to get rid of the Johnson Amendment because our pastors and ministers should have the right to go out and speak their minds." These are the people we respect, and they're actually precluded from speaking their mind. If they speak their mind, their whole tax-exempt status can be taken away.
Pulled out from under them, yeah.
So we're getting rid... and I think it's one of the most important things that I'll be doing for the evangelicals and for religion. So, I think it's very, very important. So, we're going to get rid of the Johnson Amendment.
And what about Obamacare? The administration admitted these premiums are going to go up 25% on average, could be 50% in some markets.
Right. Right.
Given that and this religious objection to the Obamacare mandate, what are you going to do as president?
Obamacare is killing our country. It's killing our jobs. It's a disaster. I've been saying it for a long time. I've been talking about it for a long time, before it was even approved.
What do you replace it with?
Whether it's health care savings accounts -- by the way, there are many things, but health care savings accounts are phenomenal. You have to break up the lines between the states so that we have competition. Once you create competition, those numbers will go so low, but you have to repeal and replace Obamacare. It's a disaster. And the number of 25%: Washington came out?
Yeah.
Say, I'm sorry to say your numbers (have) gone up 25%. It's wrong. It's going up 50%, 60%, 70%, and next year it's going to go up again. It's going to get worse. And Hillary Clinton wants to keep Obamacare going. And people are going to be paying hundreds; I mean, when you really look at it, they'll be paying 150%. It doesn't work. It's no good on its face. It doesn't work. Never would have worked, should have never been approved. It was approved by a lie. I mean, let's face it.
You mentioned Hillary Clinton. She is saying (about) your unwillingness to accept the election results, which happened at the last debate -- she says, "This poses a direct threat to our democracy." Does it?
Well, you know, who had said the same thing, and I won the last debate; according to everybody, I won it easily. But, you know, who really said it pretty well was Obama: When he was running in his first election, they asked him the same question. And he talked about rigged elections and rigged everything else. Our system is rigged.
What do you mean when you say that, specifically?
Whether it's through the media...
Not the electoral process?
Well, you know, Obama said it was. I mean, he said the electoral process is rigged. I mean, all you have to do is go back and look what he ran, when he first ran.
But are you worried about the counting of votes?
Well, if you look at research, certainly there's some of that going on. We can be babies and say it doesn't happen; but certainly, if you look at Philadelphia, if you look at Chicago, if you look at St. Louis, if you look at Obama's statements from eight years ago: Take a look at his statements, what he said about it. I saw it last night. It was, like, incredible; he was far more outgoing, as far as that's concerned, than I am; but, overall, what I'm really concerned about is the system is rigged -- whether it's the media rigging the system, there are so many things wrong. Look: Hillary Clinton shouldn't be allowed to run. She lied. What she did with her emails, where she deleted 33,000 emails, she shouldn't even be allowed to run for the presidency. She gets a subpoena from the United States Congress, and she deletes her emails. Now, James Cartwright, Gen. James Cartwright, may go to jail for five years because he lied to the FBI. She lied to the FBI probably hundreds of times, and she's allowed to do it, but a four-star general is going to go to jail? She shouldn't even be allowed to run for the office of president.
You mentioned emails. These WikiLeaks revelations have offended a lot of evangelicals and Catholics.
Right.
Now, these were members of Hillary Clinton's staff, John Podesta, her communications director, and they said things like this. They suggested that they needed to plant seeds of rebellion in the Catholic Church to somehow change the teaching to accommodate their political agenda.
Terrible. Sure.
They said it was a backward, Middle Aged dictatorship. Now, that's her staff.
It's her.
Is she guilty of that? Should she apologize?
It's her. It's her. She should apologize. I think she has to do more than apologize. You know, that's her thinking. That's her staff. Frankly, if any Catholic votes for Hillary Clinton, you know, I would say, if I were a Catholic, I wouldn't be talking to them anymore. She's been terrible in what she said and her thoughts towards Catholics and to evangelicals. She was mocking evangelicals, also. So, you'd say, why would an evangelical or a Catholic -- and almost, you could say, anybody of faith, but in particular, because they were mentioned, evangelicals and Catholics -- why would they vote for Hillary Clinton? And how could they vote for Hillary Clinton? But that's her speaking, believe me.
Well, if it's her staff. Do you think it reveals a mindset in the administration?
Well, it's her staff, but I think it's her.
Is that what you're suggesting... or in her campaign, rather?
Yeah, sure; I mean, this is the top person in her campaign. I think it reveals her, yes.
I want to talk personally about you. When you pray, what do you pray for?
I, I don't want to talk to you about that. I mean, I pray. It's very personal to me. I'm a person of belief, but I certainly, you know, I pray for my family. I pray for our country, but I don't want to talk to you about that. I think that's very personal.
OK, between you and God.
It is between me and God, yes.
You are Presbyterian, so I don't want to drag you into other realms. Do you have a favorite saint?
Well, I think that if you look, Mother Teresa, who's probably our newest, is great, and John Paul... Pope John Paul, I thought, was terrific.
Why?
Because he had something special. He had a special something. There was a warmth. There was a toughness, but there was a warmth that was incredible. So, I certainly think, Pope John Paul.
No candidate since the advent of polling has come back this late in a race from a five-point national deficit. How do you turn it around in these last days?
Well, No. 1, I don't believe there's a five-point deficit.
You don't?
It was done by CNN. And it was, you know, heavily skewed toward Democrats. I don't believe there's a five-point deficit; and if you look at the polling booths in Florida right now, if you look at where they're voting, the voting booths, I think you're going to see record crowds. That's what you're seeing. It's only two days, but that's what you're seeing. And, I think, we're going to do really well.
Hmm. You have said this is a movement. You're the leader of a movement, whether you win or lose. What are the issues that this party, the GOP, will have to contend with as part of that movement?
There are many issues. The biggest issue right now is the judges, Supreme Court judges, but Obamacare is a massive issue. The Republicans have to get rid of it. They've been unsuccessful in doing it. I will get rid of it. And I'll replace it with something much better and much less expensive for the people. Jobs have to stop leaving our country. Our military has to be rebuilt, and we need, you know, it's been very depleted. The military has to be rebuilt. We have to take care of our vets. We have to protect our Second Amendment, which is under siege. And we have to have strong borders. Right now, people are pouring into our country. Drugs are pouring into our country. We have to stop the people and the drugs.
Now, Hillary Clinton says we need (to let) more of these Syrian refugees in: "These people are suffering abroad. They need to come home. And we have... we need... they need to come here. And we as a country should be open to them." You would say what?
I would say: She's crazy. I would say that it's one of the dumbest things I've ever heard. We have no idea. We're not vetting them properly. We have no idea -- are they ISIS? Are they not ISIS? Where are they coming from? Who they are? We're taking them in by the tens of thousands right now, and Hillary Clinton wants to upgrade that by 550%. I would say to you it's crazy to be doing this, and I will stop it immediately. We will not have radical Islamic terrorists coming into our country, and some of them will be radical Islamic terrorists.
OK, my final question: It is perhaps the most portentous. We've been seeing on social media, we've been seeing it in The New York Times, in USA Today -- are you saying "big leagueig league " or "big league"? And my guess is within. So there's money riding on this.
Well...
"Big leagueig league " or "big league?"
Now, let me ask you: Are you talking about for me?
When you're speaking on the podium, and you say, "This is...?"
I, I use, "big league."
I was right!
Good. OK, good.
"Big league, " you've settled it.
OK. Thank you.
With me now on the line is Donald J. Trump, running for president, the Republican nominee from New York. Mr. Trump, thanks for joining me on Breitbart News Daily and first of all congrats on the new hotel that opened yesterday.
Oh thank you. It's great, it's great on Pennsylvania Avenue you. I figure I'll get there one way the other. We'll get to Pennsylvania Avenue one way or the other, but we hope it's the way I'm doing now with the campaign.
And well you'll have two properties on Pennsylvania if things go according to plan. Let's talk about the hotel quickly because I was so flabbergasted by the media trying to hold it against you that you delivered a hotel that you you bid on, it was a government bid and for 200 million dollars, you put 200 million more in it, finished it under budget and ahead of schedule and the Clinton News Network, as it has become known, actually sort of attacked you for it. What was that about?
Amazing thing happened. I thought that it would be perfect timing, in fact it just happened to be completed right before the election, and I said wow, what timing, that's a gift because we built it under budget and ahead of schedule which is something the government never does. I mean when they build a hospital it'll cost it'll start off at six hundred million and cost two billion dollars, OK, it's horrible what what goes on. I look at the numbers and they build a highway, a road, a tunnel, costs three, four times as much sometimes. So I said you know this is great, we have a building, it's one of the great it's gonna be one of the great hotels in the world and one of the most beautiful buildings in the country.
The building's the exceptional.
Yes, built in 1889. And it's a landmark and it's it just an incredible building. So I said wow, this is great timing, you know even for the campaign. And so we opened it and all I heard -- now you have to understand that I've been doing more campaigning probably they say than anybody maybe ever in terms of presidential, I'm from six in the morning 'til two in the morning, literally, I get in sometimes at two. Today we're going to Iowa, we're going to Maine, Manchester, New Hampshire, we're all over the place. And and you know all day long it's different places. So we came in from North Carolina and we immediately left for Pennsylvania after the hotel and they put out a narrative that "Donald Trump takes time off from his campaign." Now, Hillary Clinton goes home and stays there all day and she'll come out for one event or two you know not even two events, I mean she really rarely does two events cause I don't think she has the strength to do two events, but but she'll still do very little by comparison. I'm not knocking it, I'm saying you know she's got this machine behind her, the Democratic machine what's all it is, that's what she's got. And the media's behind her so much. So she'll do a very short session and go home and go to sleep, and they put out the narrative like I'm taking time off from the campaign. Actually, I viewed differently. I mean I the the under budget ahead of schedule is a very important thing.
This is a big success for you, this is what you do.
And importantly my children were involved and I wanted to honor my children. Because how could I have an opening of a massive hotel with thousands of employees, you know we had thousands of construction workers, everything and how could I possibly do that when you know I'm opening this big building on Pennsylvania Avenue, and not run in run out cut the ribbon run in run out, right? So I did that and they had they made such a big deal over the fact that I was taking time off from the campaign. Which by the way would have been about the first time in two months. And I thought it was disgusting, I thought it was terrible. I honored my children, we honored the hotel itself, I mean it's a tremendous hotel, and we honored all the workers. I mean even the workers there, we had in a tremendous number of workers and construction workers there that built it over a two year period and even the workers there, it would have been very disrespectful if I didn't show up. So I thought it was a terrible thing and you're right the Clinton News Network really built it up and it's just amazing.
So the polls are looking great for you. The the ABC-Washington Post tracking poll has you closing the gap eight points in just four days, we have our Breitbart Gravis poll where you're only down one nationally, you're up in Florida according to Bloomberg. So the path is there and I really think that the key has been Hillary Clinton has been in the news as opposed to Donald Trump scandals, either real or fabricated. The last week or so you guys have kept Clinton in the news. How do you keep her in the news for the next 11 days?
Well we're doing our rallies we're you know you're seeing the crowds we're getting, we're getting twenty-five, thirty thousand people to rally and we're doing our rallies and doing a speech that very much it's not the same speech at all it's just a speech that very much talks about the same topics: Obamacare, which is a disaster. We've gotta repeal it and replace it and we can do that with something so good. Taxes, we talk about taxes are way too high. She's giving a tax increase, we're giving a tax decrease. We talk about regulations. We talk about the depleted military and how we're going to take care of the vets -- we're going to really take care of our vets for the first time maybe ever, and she can't do that, she doesn't -- she thinks the system is OK the way it is. So she's got some really bad things. Saving our Second Amendment, which is so important, it's under siege. So we have some things that are you know we have we have the right points and the press has been unbelievably unfair to us and you know when you talk about different things a lot of things they just make up. You'll make a statement that is a perfect statement and they'll find a way to take that statement, chop it up and make it bad. It's incredible, actually. It's incredible.
This is Breitbart News Daily on the SiriusXM Patriot channel 125, Alex Marlow, Host, Donald J. Trump is our guest. Mr. Trump, can you explain to people who might not be a huge fan of yours but also do not like Hillary Clinton, especially these conservatives out there -- what's your pitch to these voters who might be holding out and might be ensuring a Clinton White House?
Well Alex, one of the things is the United States Supreme Court. You know we're going to pick justices in the mold of Judge Scalia, Justice Scalia, conservative, pro-life. We're going to pick Second Amendment people, people that respect the Second Amendment. And we've put out a list, all vetted by Federalist, Federalist Society, highly recommended by them, and we have a list of 20 judges and we're putting them out and it's been the list has been unbelievably well received. Because I wanted to make sure they understood that you know we're putting out a very important list and not that I pick some liberal judge after they chose me. So I actually put a list from which I will only pick. In other words I will only pick one of these people given to us by the Federalist Society and also Heritage who -- run by a great guy, Jim, but we so we have a list of great judges and if for no other reason, that should be a reason. Because you know it doesn't get talked about enough.
I think that's on the money. I would submit another one, and I think this was it should have been -- in a fair media this would have been the signature moment of the campaign -- is the WikiLeaks that Hillary Clinton told a Brazilian bank for a quarter of a million dollars that she wants hemispheric open borders. Give me a reaction to that quote.
Incredible. I mention it every single speech, but she wants open borders, totally free trade. I mean you know she wants trade. So you lose your businesses and you lose your country if you do that, but absolutely.
Another key vulnerability she has and she is -- it's been 18 months she's been on the campaign trail, she has not been out she has not had to answer one question about her State Department approving twenty percent of U.S. uranium to Russia and the Clinton Foundation bagging 145 million in the process. How is this possible, and your thoughts on her Russian uranium deal.
There has never been anything like it. To me that's one of the worst things and I I don't know it just doesn't seem to get picked up by anybody. They don't pick up a lot of things. They won't pick up all the things that came out yesterday. Now one thing I will say, the WikiLeaks seem to be getting worse and worse. Do you agree with that? I mean it seems like --
Yes.
The initial ones were bad, but they seem to be getting worse and worse. You know one that you may disagree with me, but to me it was very important when Donna Brazile had the answers to the debate or the questions to the debate and she gave them to Hillary Clinton and Hillary Clinton used them and didn't turn em in? I thought that was incredible, I mean that was that was -- in terms of honor. So Donna Brazile got the questions to the debate and she gave the questions to Hillary Clinton this came out in WikiLeaks also, as you know. And Hillary Clinton, instead of saying, "I'm sorry I can't use these," and turning them in, Hillary Clinton used them and only got caught because of WikiLeaks. I thought that was a terrible one, I mean to be honest with you.
And you so and and so when you talk about this system being rigged it's not just necessarily voter fraud, a lot of it has to do with the media.
Yeah it's voter fraud too, but it's also the media and it's also the fact that she's even allowed to run. Hey look, the FBI looked at many many criminal events including the deletion of 33,000 emails after she got a subpoena. She got a subpoena, she got a subpoena from the United States Congress and then after getting the subpoena she probably said "Oh, we gotta get rid of this stuff." They deleted 33,000 emails. I mean if you look at nothing else. I usually use that because it's so simple. You know, that's like simple. But if you use nothing else -- nobody's allowed to do that. And the private server, that came off the private server and I'll tell you what, those emails contain awful information. Those emails they have got things on there that are -- for them to do that and then bleach the emails, a very expensive process on top of it, get rid of her iPhone by hammer --
And why would you do that if you didn't have something to hide? Mr. Trump you you --
No, no --
You've been so generous --
I mean even getting rid of the phones and they smashed em, by hammer.
Yes.
And they said they've never seen anything -- now we're 3 or 4 down --
Right.
And we're you know considered to be virtually tied. I don't believe the 12, I'm not sure believe the 3. You go to Florida, you see lines that are four blocks long. You've been hearing about it. In Florida they're voting, early voting, and the lines are four blocks log. Look at North Carolina, look at Ohio, look what's happening, the spirit and the the love. And I think Pennsylvania is going to be a big surprise for people, because I'm getting crowds in Pennsylvania like like practically nowhere else. And so it is a movement, it's a movement like they've never seen in this country and I'll tell you what, it will be a really unified country if we win, because we're gonna do the right thing. And if we lose I just don't know what's going to happen. I don't know what's gonna happen. People are asking me that question, I just don't know.
That's Donald J. Trump. He's a New York billionaire riding a populist wave in the Republican nomination, has a lot of momentum in the polls. Thank you so much, Mr. Trump, for joining us --
Thank you, Alex --
On Breitbart Daily with --
very much.
But you could lose this election and it not be rigged.
I'm having a hard time myself getting by the fact that the FBI took $675,000. The man that is in charge of her case took $675,000, let her off scot free.
You know what they say, that had already happened, that they tried to separate the two.
Give me a break.
I'm just telling you. That's what he says.
Give me a break.
Well first, let me say I think we're going to win this election. I really do.
In which case we will accept the results.
When Donald Trump talks about a rigged system, it's a national media with present company excepted, a national media that has been overwhelmingly hostile to my running mate and has been practicing willful ignorance on most issues emanating out of the years of scandal around Hillary Clinton.
For me, I have to see what happens on that evening. But I can tell you, we're off to a bad start because Hillary Clinton is a criminal.
Ok. We got that part of the case. But what I'm saying --
The FBI let her off.
You said, hold on now. And you calmed her down. So for your supporters who are saying they are going to grab the musket or the pitch fork, you have a message for them.
I can only say this. Very bad things are happening out there. When I see in WikiLeaks that they have total control of the "New York Times" --
No. But he is calming them down and you're not.
I want him to do whatever he wants to do.
What's the biggest difference you've experienced between running a political campaign and the enterprises you have run in your career prior to this?
This is all public. That's private. I used to get great press. Now I get the world's worst press. No matter how well you do -- I will say this, I used to get great publicity. Now I get record setting -- I get record setting publicity, but most of it is bad.
So you think you will meet the $100 million?
I am going to meet what have I to meet. But I'm going to put more money in. I think I'm putting $10 million more in today.
Has the --
Again, I'm putting my money in. She's not putting any of her money in.
Has the Republican Party been a net plus to you as you run for president? What about the RNC?
I have had a good relationship with the RNC. And you know I'm a straight shooter. I would tell you. Reince is a terrific guy. He's really worked hard. And I think he's very devastated that Paul Ryan and others haven't been more like let's get in there and help. I like Paul Ryan, but I'm disappointed that we haven't had more help.
So you would --
I'm not -- I'm not thinking about that. I will tell you this. We have tremendous support within the Republican Party, and the base is phenomenal. I guess we have 84 percent, 85 percent. But if we had leadership support, we would do even better. Mitch McConnell is an example. He has got senators where I'm doing better than his senators, but they don't want to get involved with Trump. I'm doing better than they are in their state. And I can name three of them. But they are running. I'm doing great. We should be running together. I don't care that we're not running together. I couldn't care less, actually. They would do better if they got together with me.
If you do lose, is the Republican Party dead?
No. I think it's going to be a different Republican Party. We have a base of people that are so incredible. You have to see the rallies, people get there at 7:00 in the morning. We had the other day a group of people that came 4:00 in the morning for a rally that started at 8:00 in the evening. There has never been crowds like that. Look, in the history of politics in this country, there's never been crowds like we are getting.
In the trial of former aides to New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, multiple witnesses have now refuted the claims by Christie that he was unaware of this scheme to punish a mayor who refused to give Christie his endorsement for reelection. Do you have confidence in Governor Christie to lead your transition team?
I have great confidence in him. I have not been following the trial. I don't know really --
Back in the primary you said he knew.
I just don't -- I haven't been following the trial. The trial is almost over. It will be interesting to see what happens. But I do like him very much and I have confidence in him. And I hope it all works out well for him.
I realize you are confident on victory. On the other hand, if you do lose, what does Donald Trump do? Does he lead a movement? Does he go back to business?
I can tell you this has been one of the most incredible parts of my life. There's never been anything like this. Your friend O'Reilly said the greatest political phenomenon of his lifetime.
Mr. Trump, thanks for the time.
Thank you very much.
Donald Trump is actually joining us on the phone right now. Mr. Trump good morning to you.
Good morning.
And?
I've decided to vote for Trump.
Mm-hmm.
It's been a beautiful process. The people of this country are incredible. I've been all over the country, met the people at every level. I've met the people at every level and they are amazing. So that's, and that's really the thing, I think when people say what have you learned? That's what I've learned. The people of this country are amazing.
Right. Ivanka said last night to Sean Hannity, it's changed you. Do you agree? And if so how would you build on that? In what way?
Well I think it has changed me because I see, you know, so many hopes and so many dreams out there that didn't happen, that could have happened, with leadership, with proper leadership. And people are hurt so badly. You look at the veterans; they've been hurt so badly. They're great people. There are great people and they've been hurt so badly. And they're being taken care of so badly.
Wow.
And we had probably 21,000 people. Can you imagine that?
And you're out this early.
21,000 people and I'm up this early. Well I have no choice because I'm doing you folks right.
So many of your voters are watching and watch Fox. Back in June of 2015 about a year and a half ago, that's when you made the announcement --
Right.
Mm-hmm.
So you know, you almost say well, you're talking about how important trade is. Well trade's important but when you lose $800 billion you're just sapping your wealth. So you know those two subjects were right at front and center --
Sure.
When I did that on June 16. And now lo and behold they're still right up there.
They are indeed.
Very important subjects.
You've --
Along with Obamacare.
Run on that, I was going to mention the Affordable Care Act --
Yeah we have to terminate --
Which you've been hammering.
We have to terminate it. We have to repeal it and replace it. It's horrible. It's driving people out of business.
Sure.
And I mean people can't afford it. First of all people can't afford it. Second of all it's no good. It doesn't work.
I've heard you say that out on the stump. All right Mr. Trump a little less than 12 hours from right now the first polls are going to be closing. What states in particular are you going to watch for? And how they determine the balance of your night?
Well I think we've been doing very well in a lot of states that you know I was hoping to do well in. I mean we're doing very well in North Carolina. I think we're doing very, very well in Florida.
Those are the two most important early states aren't they?
We're going to do very well in New Hampshire. Excuse me?
Yeah.
And they just seem to say Trump, Trump, Trump.
OK while we --
I want to watch that again, I love it.
We had Heather in Wauwatosa --
That's right Heather was there and Abby was there. And everybody's saying Trump and I say, good. In fact I think I'm going to watch it a second time.
I know.
I mean I'm not; I don't need anybody to fill up the room. Last night we had 28,000 people at 1:30 or 1:00 practically 1:00 in the morning, 28,000 people.
It's amazing.
In Michigan. And we had; by the way, we had 22,000 people in New Hampshire at the big arena. It was incredible last night. And you know, I will say I have the best surrogates. I have my kids, I have my family.
Right.
You know Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany, all of them, they go around they make speeches.
Right.
They are better than the people you just said.
Even Hillary Clinton said that your family was your best attribute. Anyway, closing argument, because this is your last day. So if you had your day in court, you know the jury before they go back to make a decision, both of the attorneys can make their closing argument. What is yours today?
Well I have a lot of things to say. We have to build up our military, it's depleted. We have to take care of our vets. We have to make strong borders --
Right.
We have to make great trade deals. And we have to terminate Obamacare. Have to terminate it. We're going to come up with great health care at a fraction of the cost, much better and much less expensive. Save our Second Amendment and remember the Supreme Court.
Sure.
I will have spent over $100 billion of my own campaign. Meaning I don't have to take tremendous, I don't have to take the money from all the fat cats that are going to tell you what to do. I think it's a big asset. It doesn't get talked about much.
Yeah. So you feel that way?
I think it's a tremendous asset. But no I will consider it; I will not consider it great if I don't win.
Right.
We had last night in Michigan we had 10,000 people outside that couldn't get in.
Wow.
10,000 people. It's been amazing. So I said something's happening. Something's really going on.
Exactly. Then the DNC was giving questions to Wolf Blitzer. CNN was asking them, what questions do you want Wolf Blitzer to ask Donald Trump during an interview? Now we found out this morning because of WikiLeaks, the husband of one of the Vice Presidents over at CNN, his name is Thomas Nides, the husband, was writing Hillary Clinton's Campaign Chairman Podesta, asking him or saying to him, we have a good CNN poll that's coming John, John Podesta writes back, I look forward to how that is spun. What's your response?
Oh wow. Well I think it's terrible. Like I talk about the polls. And I understand the business. And it's terrible what's going on. And I think more terrible than that is the fact that Hillary Clinton through Donna Brazile got the questions to, I mean think of it, got the questions to the debate. I mean three of them now. And probably more. Maybe mine too. Although I don't know, I didn't think she performed particularly well. But I will tell you this: She got a lot of questions to the debates.
Right.
And you know if you were in West Point and if you got the questions like that, they would throw you out of the school if you didn't report yourself.
Of course.
She didn't report it. She didn't give it to an Ethics Committee or anybody. She took the questions, she got the answers to the questions, she went on.
It's rigged!
I mean she would have been thrown out of West Point or Annapolis or the Air Force Academy. Here we have her running for president.
But Donald as you look at your son about to vote and your daughter-in-law about to vote, I'm just wondering if you had a chance to see, look back at anything that you've done or not done, and said I regret this? Any regrets right now?
You know Brian there's always regrets. If you could go back and change things, but you can't. So you just have to learn from, sure there are things that I would have done differently. But you know you just have to go forward.
Sure.
You do want to learn. But there's nothing you can do. I'm very proud of my children and I'm just looking at them right now as an example you show. But I'm very proud because Don and Eric and Ivanka and you know to a lesser extent because she just got out of school, out of college, but Tiffany has also been so terrific.
Right.
I mean they worked so hard.
Everybody did.

Mr. Trump we only have a few final seconds with you, we may not hear from you the balance of the day, what would you like to say to the people of America right now? Final message.
